746,SHP2 promotes laryngeal cancer growth through the Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway and serves as a prognostic indicator for laryngeal cancer.,"The overall survival rate and prognosis of patients with laryngeal cancer are not optimistic despite advances in therapeutic techniques. Gene expression prognostic models enable the development of more appropriate treatment strategies. The human gene PTPN11 encoding a non-receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase, Src homology phosphotyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2), is a well-documented proto-oncogene in various malignancies. This study investigated the role of SHP2 expression and associated clinical manifestations in laryngeal cancer using a tissue microarray of 112 pairs of laryngeal cancer samples and corresponding adjacent normal mucosae. SHP2 expression increased in laryngeal cancer, and this result was associated with the poor survival rate of laryngeal cancer patients. Moreover, increased SHP2 expression remarkably promoted the growth of laryngeal cancer cells in vitro and tumorigenicity of laryngeal cancer cells in vivo. The Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk pathway was also found to be involved in the SHP2-induced growth of laryngeal cancer cells. Overall, our findings indicated that SHP2 plays an important role in laryngeal cancer tumorigenesis and that its expression is negatively correlated with the prognosis of patients. Thus, SHP2 may be a promising combinational therapeutic target for treatment of laryngeal cancer. The interference of SHP2 expression can serve as a novel strategy for laryngeal cancer treatment.",cancer
421,"Response to Crizotinib Observed in Lung Adenocarcinoma with MET Copy Number Gain but without a High-Level MET/CEP7 Ratio, MET Overexpression, or Exon 14 Splicing Mutations.","MMNG HOS Transforming gene (MET) is an important driver gene in non-small cell lung cancer. Yet, MET-relevant biomarkers predictive of clinical response to MET inhibitors remain elusive. Limited studies have indicated some possibly effective biomarkers, including amplification with a high-level MET/centromere probe of chromosome 7 (CEP7) ratio, MET exon 14 (METex14) splicing mutations, and MET overexpression. MET copy number gain (MCNG) is an independent negative prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer. Therefore, there remains a lack of clinical evidence regarding whether MCNG is a biomarker predictive of response to MET inhibitors. Here we report a patient with lung adenocarcinoma with MCNG but without a high-level MET/CEP7 ratio or METex14 splicing mutations who achieved a rapid response to crizotinib, indicating that MCNG may be an independent predictive biomarker for response to MET inhibitors.",cancer
261,Genome-wide profiling of genetic synthetic lethality identifies CDK12 as a novel determinant of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity.,"Small-molecule inhibitors of PARP1/2, such as olaparib, have been proposed to serve as a synthetic lethal therapy for cancers that harbor BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. Indeed, in clinical trials, PARP1/2 inhibitors elicit sustained antitumor responses in patients with germline BRCA gene mutations. In hypothesizing that additional genetic determinants might direct use of these drugs, we conducted a genome-wide synthetic lethal screen for candidate olaparib sensitivity genes. In support of this hypothesis, the set of identified genes included known determinants of olaparib sensitivity, such as BRCA1, RAD51, and Fanconi's anemia susceptibility genes. In addition, the set included genes implicated in established networks of DNA repair, DNA cohesion, and chromatin remodeling, none of which were known previously to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition. Notably, integration of the list of candidate sensitivity genes with data from tumor DNA sequencing studies identified CDK12 deficiency as a clinically relevant biomarker of PARP1/2 inhibitor sensitivity. In models of high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGS-OVCa), CDK12 attenuation was sufficient to confer sensitivity to PARP1/2 inhibition, suppression of DNA repair via homologous recombination, and reduced expression of BRCA1. As one of only nine genes known to be significantly mutated in HGS-OVCa, CDK12 has properties that should confirm interest in its use as a biomarker, particularly in ongoing clinical trials of PARP1/2 inhibitors and other agents that trigger replication fork arrest.",cancer
644,MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels are associated with favorable outcome in patients with inflammatory breast cancer treated with bevacizumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the BEVERLY-2 study.,"Addition of bevacizumab to trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) was associated with favorable outcome in the BEVERLY-2 phase II trial. Circulating levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) 2 and 9 were correlated to high response rate and prolonged survival in high-grade glioma treated with bevacizumab. We examined the prognostic impact of MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels in BEVERLY-2 patients. MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels were assessed using ELISA at baseline and before surgery in 45/52 available samples. Correlations were tested with pathological complete response (pCR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Baseline (b) MMP2 and MMP9 serum levels were independent from patient characteristics and circulating tumor or endothelial cells, and were not correlated to pCR. High bMMP2 was correlated to better DFS (p=0.001) and OS (p=0.032), while low bMMP9 was correlated to better OS (p=0.022) and tended to be associated with longer DFS (p=0.071). In multivariate analyses, bMMP2 (p=0.003, Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.115) and bMMP9 (p=0.041, HR: 3.511) remained correlated to DFS. As continuous variables, bMMP2 was associated with relapse (p=0.002) and death (p=0.049), while bMMP9 was associated with death (p=0.035). During treatment, significant increase in MMP2 and decrease in MMP9 levels (p<0.001 for both) were observed in 100% and 87% of patients respectively. High bMMP2 and low bMMP9 serum levels were associated with better survival in HER2-positive IBC patients treated with bevacizumab- and trastuzumab-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Their predictive value of bevacizumab benefit should be evaluated in a randomized trial.",cancer
1495,Src Family Kinases Modulate the Loss of Endothelial Barrier Function in Response to TNF-α: Crosstalk with p38 Signaling.,"Activation of Src Family Kinase (SFK) signaling is required for the increase in endothelial permeability induced by a variety of cytokines and growth factors. However, we previously demonstrated that activation of endogenous SFKs by expression of dominant negative C-terminal Src Kinase (DN-Csk) is not sufficient to decrease endothelial adherens junction integrity. Basal SFK activity has been observed in normal venular endothelia and was not associated with increased basal permeability. The basal SFK activity however was found to contribute to increased sensitivity of the venular endothelium to inflammatory mediator-induced leakage. How SFK activation achieves this is still not well understood. Here, we show that SFK activation renders human dermal microvascular endothelial cells susceptible to low doses of TNF-α. Treatment of DN-Csk-expressing cells with 50 pg/ml TNF-α induced a loss of TEER as well as drastic changes in the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesion proteins. This synergistic effect was independent of ROCK or NF-κB activity. TNF-α-induced p38 signaling was required for the synergistic effect on barrier function, and activation of the p38 MAPK alone was also able to induce changes in permeability only in monolayers with active SFKs. These results suggest that the activation of endogenous levels of SFK renders the endothelial barrier more susceptible to low, physiologic doses of TNF-α through activation of p38 which leads to a loss of endothelial tight junctions.",nonCancer
995,Germline epigenetic regulation of KILLIN in Cowden and Cowden-like syndrome.,"Germline loss-of-function phosphatase and tensin homolog gene (PTEN) mutations cause 80% of Cowden syndrome, a rare autosomal-dominant disorder (1 in 200,000 live births), characterized by high risks of breast, thyroid, and other cancers. A large heterogeneous group of individuals with Cowden-like syndrome, who have various combinations of Cowden syndrome features but who do not meet Cowden syndrome diagnostic criteria, have PTEN mutations less than 10% of the time, making molecular diagnosis, prediction, genetic counseling, and risk management challenging. Other mechanisms of loss of function such as hypermethylation, which should result in underexpression of PTEN or of KILLIN, a novel tumor suppressor transcribed in the opposite direction, may account for the remainder of Cowden syndrome and Cowden-like syndrome. To determine whether germline methylation is found in Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome in individuals lacking germline PTEN mutations. Nucleic acids from prospective nested series of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and 50 unaffected individuals without PTEN variants were analyzed for germline methylation and expression of PTEN and KILLIN at the Cleveland Clinic, August 2008-June 2010. Prevalence of component cancers between groups was compared using the Fisher exact test. Frequency of germline methylation in PTEN mutation-negative Cowden syndrome and Cowden syndrome-like individuals. Prevalence of component cancers in methylation-positive and PTEN mutation-positive individuals. Of 123 patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome, 45 (37%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29%-45%) showed hypermethylation upstream of PTEN but no transcriptional repression. The germline methylation was found to transcriptionally down-regulate KILLIN by 250-fold (95% CI, 45-14 286; P = .007) and exclusively disrupted TP53 activation of KILLIN by 30% (95% CI, 7%-45%; P = .008). Demethylation treatment increased only KILLIN expression 4.88-fold (95% CI, 1.4-18.1; P = .05). Individuals with KILLIN -promoter methylation had a 3-fold increased prevalence of breast cancer (35/42 vs 24/64; P < .0001) and a greater than 2-fold increase of kidney cancer (4/45 vs 6/155; P = .004) over individuals with germline PTEN mutations. Germline KILLIN methylation is common among patients with Cowden syndrome or Cowden-like syndrome and is associated with increased risks of breast and renal cancer over PTEN mutation-positive individuals. These observations need to be replicated.",cancer
2305,An investigation into the bilateral functional differences of the lower limb muscles in standing and walking.,"To date, most studies use surface electromyographic (sEMG) signals as the control source on active rehabilitation robots, and unilateral data are collected based on the gait symmetry hypothesis, which has caused much controversy. The purpose of this study is to quantitatively evaluate the sEMG activity asymmetry of bilateral muscles in lower extremities during functional tasks. Nine participants were instructed to perform static and dynamic steady state tests. sEMG signals from the tibialis anterior, soleus, medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius muscles of bilateral lower extremities were recorded in the experiments. Muscle activities are quantified in terms of sEMG amplitude. We investigated whether characteristics of left limb and the one of the right limb have the same statistical characteristics during functional tasks using The Wilcoxon rank-sum test, and studied dynamic signal irregularity degree for sEMG activities via sample entropy. The total of muscle activities showed significant differences between left limb and right limb during the static steady state (p = 0.000). For dynamic steady states, there were significant differences for most muscle activities between left limb and right limb at different speeds (p = 0.000). Nevertheless, there was no difference between the lateral gastrocnemius for bilateral limb at 2.0 kilometers per hour (p = 0.060). For medial gastrocnemius, differences were not found between left limb and right limb at 1.0 and 3.0 kilometers per hours (p = 0.390 and p = 0.085, respectively). Similarly, there was no difference for soleus at 3.0 kilometers per hour (p = 0.115). The importance of the differences in muscle activities between left limb and right limb were found. These results can potentially be used for evaluating lower limb extremity function of special populations (elderly people or stroke patients) in an objective and simple method.",nonCancer
1276,A signature of neural coding at human perceptual limits.,"Simple visual features, such as orientation, are thought to be represented in the spiking of visual neurons using population codes. I show that optimal decoding of such activity predicts characteristic deviations from the normal distribution of errors at low gains. Examining human perception of orientation stimuli, I show that these predicted deviations are present at near-threshold levels of contrast. The findings may provide a neural-level explanation for the appearance of a threshold in perceptual awareness whereby stimuli are categorized as seen or unseen. As well as varying in error magnitude, perceptual judgments differ in certainty about what was observed. I demonstrate that variations in the total spiking activity of a neural population can account for the empirical relationship between subjective confidence and precision. These results establish population coding and decoding as the neural basis of perception and perceptual confidence.",nonCancer
941,The role of aberrant VHL/HIF pathway elements in predicting clinical outcome to pazopanib therapy in patients with metastatic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Inactivation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC) leads to increased levels of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF) and overexpression of HIF target genes, such as VEGF and others. VEGF-targeted agents are standard in advanced clear-cell RCC but biomarkers of activity are lacking. We analyzed tumor tissue samples from metastatic clear-cell RCC patients who received pazopanib as part of clinical trial VEG102616. We evaluated several components of the VHL/HIF pathway: VHL gene inactivation (mutation and/or methylation), HIF-1α and HIF-2α immunohistochemistry staining, and HIF-1α transcriptional signature. We evaluated the association of these biomarkers with best overall response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to pazopanib, a standard first-line VEGF-targeted agent. The VEG102616 trial enrolled 225 patients, from whom 78 samples were available for tumor DNA extraction. Of these, 70 patients had VHL mutation or methylation. VHL gene status did not correlate with ORR or PFS. Similarly, HIF-1α (65 samples) and HIF-2α (66 samples) protein levels (high vs. low) did not correlate with ORR or PFS to pazopanib. The HIF-1α transcriptional signature (46 samples) was enriched in tumors expressing high HIF-1α levels. However, the HIF-1α gene expression signature was not associated with clinical outcome to pazopanib. In patients with advanced clear-cell RCC, several potential biomarkers along the VHL/HIF-1α/HIF-2α axis were not found to be predictive for pazopanib activity. Additional efforts must continue to identify biomarkers associated with clinical outcome to VEGF-targeted agents in metastatic RCC.",cancer
354,Smoothened variants explain the majority of drug resistance in basal cell carcinoma.,"Advanced basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) frequently acquire resistance to Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors through unknown mechanisms. Here we identify SMO mutations in 50% (22 of 44) of resistant BCCs and show that these mutations maintain Hedgehog signaling in the presence of SMO inhibitors. Alterations include four ligand binding pocket mutations defining sites of inhibitor binding and four variants conferring constitutive activity and inhibitor resistance, illuminating pivotal residues that ensure receptor autoinhibition. In the presence of a SMO inhibitor, tumor cells containing either class of SMO mutants effectively outcompete cells containing the wild-type SMO. Finally, we show that both classes of SMO variants respond to aPKC-ι/λ or GLI2 inhibitors that operate downstream of SMO, setting the stage for the clinical use of GLI antagonists.",cancer
1051,"Rucaparib in relapsed, platinum-sensitive high-grade ovarian carcinoma (ARIEL2 Part 1): an international, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.","Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have activity in ovarian carcinomas with homologous recombination deficiency. Along with BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA) mutations genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) might also represent homologous recombination deficiency. In ARIEL2, we assessed the ability of tumour genomic LOH, quantified with a next-generation sequencing assay, to predict response to rucaparib, an oral PARP inhibitor. ARIEL2 is an international, multicentre, two-part, phase 2, open-label study done at 49 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Canada, France, Spain, the UK, and the USA. In ARIEL2 Part 1, patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma were classified into one of three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups on the basis of tumour mutational analysis: BRCA mutant (deleterious germline or somatic), BRCA wild-type and LOH high (LOH high group), or BRCA wild-type and LOH low (LOH low group). We prespecified a cutoff of 14% or more genomic LOH for LOH high. Patients began treatment with oral rucaparib at 600 mg twice per day for continuous 28 day cycles until disease progression or any other reason for discontinuation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. All patients treated with at least one dose of rucaparib were included in the safety analyses and all treated patients who were classified were included in the primary endpoint analysis. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01891344. Enrolment into ARIEL2 Part 1 is complete, although an extension (Part 2) is ongoing. 256 patients were screened and 206 were enrolled between Oct 30, 2013, and Dec 19, 2014. At the data cutoff date (Jan 18, 2016), 204 patients had received rucaparib, with 28 patients remaining in the study. 192 patients could be classified into one of the three predefined homologous recombination deficiency subgroups: BRCA mutant (n=40), LOH high (n=82), or LOH low (n=70). Tumours from 12 patients were established as BRCA wild-type, but could not be classified for LOH, because of insufficient neoplastic nuclei in the sample. The median duration of treatment for the 204 patients was 5·7 months (IQR 2·8-10·1). 24 patients in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 56 patients in the LOH high subgroup, and 59 patients in the LOH low subgroup had disease progression or died. Median progression-free survival after rucaparib treatment was 12·8 months (95% CI 9·0-14·7) in the BRCA mutant subgroup, 5·7 months (5·3-7·6) in the LOH high subgroup, and 5·2 months (3·6-5·5) in the LOH low subgroup. Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the BRCA mutant (hazard ratio 0·27, 95% CI 0·16-0·44, p<0·0001) and LOH high (0·62, 0·42-0·90, p=0·011) subgroups compared with the LOH low subgroup. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment-emergent adverse events were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin (45 [22%] patients), and elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase (25 [12%]). Common serious adverse events included small intestinal obstruction (10 [5%] of 204 patients), malignant neoplasm progression (10 [5%]), and anaemia (nine [4%]). Three patients died during the study (two because of disease progression and one because of sepsis and disease progression). No treatment-related deaths occurred. In patients with BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and LOH high platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinomas treated with rucaparib, progression-free survival was longer than in patients with BRCA wild-type LOH low carcinomas. Our results suggest that assessment of tumour LOH can be used to identify patients with BRCA wild-type platinum-sensitive ovarian cancers who might benefit from rucaparib. These results extend the potential usefulness of PARP inhibitors in the treatment setting beyond BRCA mutant tumours.

1473,Modelling perceptions of criminality and remorse from faces using a data-driven computational approach.,"Perceptions of criminality and remorse are critical for legal decision-making. While faces perceived as criminal are more likely to be selected in police lineups and to receive guilty verdicts, faces perceived as remorseful are more likely to receive less severe punishment recommendations. To identify the information that makes a face appear criminal and/or remorseful, we successfully used two different data-driven computational approaches that led to convergent findings: one relying on the use of computer-generated faces, and the other on photographs of people. In addition to visualising and validating the perceived looks of criminality and remorse, we report correlations with earlier face models of dominance, threat, trustworthiness, masculinity/femininity, and sadness. The new face models of criminal and remorseful appearance contribute to our understanding of perceived criminality and remorse. They can be used to study the effects of perceived criminality and remorse on decision-making; research that can ultimately inform legal policies.",nonCancer
35,Overwhelming response to Dabrafenib in a patient with double BRAF mutation (V600E; V600M) metastatic malignant melanoma.,"The recent findings brought the necessity of testing the mutational status of a series of genes which had been already identified as responsible for melanomas development and progression, such as BRAF, CKIT and PTEN: the consequent results are, in fact, essential to guide the assessment of the novel treatment protocols based on tailored targeted therapies. We present here the case of a 66 year-old male patient, diagnosed with an advanced melanoma in June 2011, and treated with Dabrafenib for double mutant metastatic disease. The patient was referred to our attention for a large exophytic malignant melanoma on the left shoulder. After complete surgical excision and elective lymph node dissection for presence of metastatic sentinel lymph node, the patient has started high-dose interferon alfa-2b injections as adjuvant therapy for a complete negative staging. The treatment was interrupted in August 2011 due to the appearance of metastatic lymph nodes. Tumor burden was rapidly growing reaching in few months the size of a tennis ball for the tumor mass located in the shoulder. Mutational study of the tumor revealed a double BRAF mutation on V-600E and V600M. This finding incited us to enroll the patient in compassionate Dabrafenib clinical trial. The therapy was started on may 2012 at 150 mg bid dosage. Almost surprisingly for the rapidity of the effect, one week later the lesion on the shoulder has reduced its size by 60% and one month later it has completely disappeared from sight. CT scan of June 2012 documented the astonishing clinical response.",cancer

1468,Evolution of the Exon-Intron Structure in Ciliate Genomes.,"A typical eukaryotic gene is comprised of alternating stretches of regions, exons and introns, retained in and spliced out a mature mRNA, respectively. Although the length of introns may vary substantially among organisms, a large fraction of genes contains short introns in many species. Notably, some Ciliates (Paramecium and Nyctotherus) possess only ultra-short introns, around 25 bp long. In Paramecium, ultra-short introns with length divisible by three (3n) are under strong evolutionary pressure and have a high frequency of in-frame stop codons, which, in the case of intron retention, cause premature termination of mRNA translation and consequent degradation of the mis-spliced mRNA by the nonsense-mediated decay mechanism. Here, we analyzed introns in five genera of Ciliates, Paramecium, Tetrahymena, Ichthyophthirius, Oxytricha, and Stylonychia. Introns can be classified into two length classes in Tetrahymena and Ichthyophthirius (with means 48 bp, 69 bp, and 55 bp, 64 bp, respectively), but, surprisingly, comprise three distinct length classes in Oxytricha and Stylonychia (with means 33-35 bp, 47-51 bp, and 78-80 bp). In most ranges of the intron lengths, 3n introns are underrepresented and have a high frequency of in-frame stop codons in all studied species. Introns of Paramecium, Tetrahymena, and Ichthyophthirius are preferentially located at the 5' and 3' ends of genes, whereas introns of Oxytricha and Stylonychia are strongly skewed towards the 5' end. Analysis of evolutionary conservation shows that, in each studied genome, a significant fraction of intron positions is conserved between the orthologs, but intron lengths are not correlated between the species. In summary, our study provides a detailed characterization of introns in several genera of Ciliates and highlights some of their distinctive properties, which, together, indicate that splicing spellchecking is a universal and evolutionarily conserved process in the biogenesis of short introns in various representatives of Ciliates.",nonCancer
2436,Chondrosarcoma in the mental foramen region of the mandible: A case report.,"Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that is characterized by the formation of cartilage by tumor cells. The tumor is commonly observed in regions where cartilage is already present. In total, 5-12% of chondrosarcomas occur in the head and neck region.

912,"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in CBLB, a Regulator of T-Cell Response, Predict Radiation Pneumonitis and Outcomes After Definitive Radiotherapy for Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.","The immune system has important roles in tumor development and outcomes after cancer treatment. We evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the gene encoding casitas B-lineage lymphoma b protein (Cbl-b), an E3 ubiquitin ligase that maintains immune tolerance by negatively regulating T-cell activation and function, were associated with outcomes after treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Samples from 393 patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy at a single institution between March 1998 and February 2009 were used to genotype 3 potentially functional SNPs in CBLB (rs1042852 C>T, rs2305035 G>A, and rs7649466 C>G). We evaluated associations between these SNPs and local recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival, overall survival, and risk of radiation pneumonitis (RP). Having the rs2305035 A variant genotypes (AA or AG) was associated with better local recurrence-free survival (median 15.8 vs. 15.3 months; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.98; P = .033), distant metastasis-free survival (median 15.4 vs. 14.0 months; adjusted HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.57-0.96; P = .024) and overall survival (median 23.5 vs. 22.8 months; adjusted HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.56-0.93; P = .013) after adjustment in a Cox proportional hazard model. Patients with these genotypes were also at greater risk of developing grade 3 or higher RP than were patients with GG genotypes in an adjusted Cox proportional hazard model. This is the first report that rs2305035 genotypes in CBLB were associated with clinical and RP risk among patients with NSCLC treated with definitive radiotherapy.

1429,Selective cytotoxic effect of non-thermal micro-DBD plasma.,"Non-thermal plasma has been extensively researched as a new cancer treatment technology. We investigated the selective cytotoxic effects of non-thermal micro-dielectric barrier discharge (micro-DBD) plasma in cervical cancer cells. Two human cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and SiHa) and one human fibroblast (HFB) cell line were treated with micro-DBD plasma. All cells underwent apoptotic death induced by plasma in a dose-dependent manner. The plasma showed selective inhibition of cell proliferation in cervical cancer cells compared to HFBs. The selective effects of the plasma were also observed between the different cervical cancer cell lines. Plasma treatment significantly inhibited the proliferation of SiHa cells in comparison to HeLa cells. The changes in gene expression were significant in the cervical cancer cells in comparison to HFBs. Among the cancer cells, apoptosis-related genes were significantly enriched in SiHa cells. These changes were consistent with the differential cytotoxic effects observed in different cell lines.",nonCancer
925,Acquired Resistance to Crizotinib in NSCLC with MET Exon 14 Skipping.,"MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase gene (MET) exon 14 skipping is a targetable alteration in lung cancer. Treatment with MET proto-oncogene, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor can cause dramatic responses in patients whose cancers have MET exon 14 skipping. Little is known, however, about acquired resistance in patients with MET exon 14 skipping. Biopsy specimens obtained at baseline and at the time of progression for a patient being treated with crizotinib were compared using targeted next-generation sequencing to assess for mechanisms of resistance. An acquired mutation in the MET kinase domain, D1228N, was found at time of progression on crizotinib in a patient with MET exon 14 skipping. One potential mechanism of acquired resistance to crizotinib in patients with MET exon 14 skipping is through second-site mutations in the MET gene. Understanding mechanisms of resistance will be important in optimizing therapy in these patients.",cancer

We studied the prevalence and clinical implications of IDH1 genomic alterations in pediatric and adult AML. Diagnostic DNA from 531 AML patients treated on Children's Oncology Group trial COG-AAML03P1 (N=257), and Southwest Oncology Group trials SWOG-9031, SWOG-9333 and SWOG-9500 (N=274), were tested for IDH1 mutations. Codon R132 mutations were absent in the pediatric cohort, but were found in 12 of 274 adult patients (4.4%, 95% CI 2.3-7.5). IDH1(R132) mutations occurred most commonly in patients with normal karyotype, and those with FLT3/ITD and NPMc mutations. Patients with IDH1(R132) mutations trended toward higher median diagnostic white blood cell counts (59.2 x 10(9) vs 29.1 x 10(9) per liter, P=0.19) than those without mutations, but the two groups did not differ significantly in age, bone marrow blast percentage, overall survival or relapse-free survival. Eleven patients (2.1%) harbored a novel V71I sequence alteration, which was found to be a germ-line polymorphism. IDH1 mutations were not detected in pediatric AML, and are uncommon in adult AML.",cancer
1805,Acute Gastroenteritis and Campylobacteriosis in Swiss Primary Care: The Viewpoint of General Practitioners.,"Acute gastroenteritis (AG) is frequently caused by infectious intestinal diseases (IID) including food- and waterborne pathogens of public health importance. Among these pathogens, Campylobacter spp. plays a major role. Many European countries monitor selected IIDs within disease surveillance systems. In Switzerland, the information on IIDs is restricted to limited surveillance data, while no data is available for AG. We conducted a qualitative study among Swiss general practitioners (GPs) to investigate the case management of AG and campylobacteriosis patients, the associated disease burden and the determinants leading to registration in the National Notification System for Infectious Diseases (NNSID). Interviews were conducted with a semi-structured questionnaire and underwent inductive content analysis based on Grounded Theory. The questionnaire was repeatedly adapted to capture emerging themes until the point of theoretical saturation. GPs perceived AG and campylobacteriosis of little relevance to their daily work and public health in general. According to GP self-estimates each consults about two cases of AG per week and diagnoses a median of five campylobacteriosis cases per year. A large proportion of AG cases receives telephone consultations only and gets medical advice from the practice nurse. Antibiotic therapy is considered useful and stool diagnostics are performed for about a fifth of consulting AG patients. Stool diagnostics (""test"") and antibiotic therapy (""treat"") are interrelated and follow four strategies: ""Wait & See"", ""Treat & See"", ""Treat & Test"", and ""Test & See"". AG case management is diverse and includes different triage steps. A small proportion of AG patients have stool diagnostics performed and only positive tested patients are reported to the NNSID. As a result severe cases and cases with a history of travel abroad are overrepresented in the NNSID. The use of multiplex PCR panels in routine diagnostics likely leads to improved case management and higher case numbers in surveillance systems.",nonCancer
2535,The Importance of Ambient Temperature to Growth and the Induction of Flowering.,"Plant development is exquisitely sensitive to the environment. Light quantity, quality, and duration (photoperiod) have profound effects on vegetative morphology and flowering time. Recent studies have demonstrated that ambient temperature is a similarly potent stimulus influencing morphology and flowering. In Arabidopsis, ambient temperatures that are high, but not so high as to induce a heat stress response, confer morphological changes that resemble the shade avoidance syndrome. Similarly, these high but not stressful temperatures can accelerate flowering under short day conditions as effectively as exposure to long days. Photoperiodic flowering entails a series of external coincidences, in which environmental cycles of light and dark must coincide with an internal cycle in gene expression established by the endogenous circadian clock. It is evident that a similar model of external coincidence applies to the effects of elevated ambient temperature on both vegetative morphology and the vegetative to reproductive transition. Further study is imperative, because global warming is predicted to have major effects on the performance and distribution of wild species and strong adverse effects on crop yields. It is critical to understand temperature perception and response at a mechanistic level and to integrate this knowledge with our understanding of other environmental responses, including biotic and abiotic stresses, in order to improve crop production sufficiently to sustainably feed an expanding world population.",nonCancer
1672,Effects of metformin on pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A meta-analysis.,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of metformin on pregnancy outcomes in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).|We searched electronic databases and bibliographies of relevant papers to identify studies comparing the pregnancy outcomes in the metformin group with those in the placebo or blank control group. Then, we did this meta-analysis based on the PRISMA guidelines. The primary outcomes included early pregnancy loss (EPL), preterm delivery, term delivery, and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Secondary outcomes included pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH), intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), fetal malformation, vaginal delivery (VD), cesarean section (CS), and metformin's side effects, such as nausea or gastrointestinal discomfort. Certainly, data about neonatal death and macrosomia were analyzed if data available.|Finally, 13 studies including 5 randomized controlled trials (RCT) and 8 cohort studies involving 1606 pregnant women with PCOS were analyzed. The pooled OR of EPL was 0.19 with obvious statistical significance, manifesting that metformin help to lower the rate of EPL (95% CI 0.12-0.28, P < 0.00001). Simultaneously, metformin showed the advantage of reducing the prevalence of preterm delivery (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.20-0.68, P = 0.002). In addition, metformin could promote term delivery greatly and the pooled OR was 5.23 with sharp statistical difference (95% CI 3.12-8.75, P < 0.00001).|Metformin treatment in women with PCOS throughout pregnancy could increase the possibility of term delivery, VD and reduce the risk of EPL, preterm labor, pregnancy complications such as GDM and PIH, with no serious side effects. Moreover, metformin was not teratogenic based on the limited data. So we may recommend metformin treatment for women with PCOS during the whole pregnancy period for it is quite beneficial and safe for both mothers and babies.",nonCancer
2269,Improvement in Serum Biochemical Alterations and Oxidative Stress of Liver and Pancreas following Use of Royal Jelly in Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetic Rats.,"This study aimed to evaluate the effects of royal jelly (RJ) on serum biochemical alterations and oxidative stress status in liver and pancreas of streptozotocin (STZ)- induced diabetic rats.|In this experimental study, thirty two male Wistar rats were divided into the following four groups (n=8/group): i. Control (C), ii. Diabetic (D), iii. Royal jelly (R), and iv. Royal jelly-treated diabetic (D/R) groups. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal (IP) injection of STZ (60 mg/kg). The RJ [100 mg/kg body weight (BW)] was administered orally for 42 days. Blood samples were used to determine serum levels of insulin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), total protein (TP), albumin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and fasting blood glucose (FBG). Also, the antioxidant status was evaluated by determining the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), catalase (CAT) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) in liver and pancreas. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with P<0.05 as the significant level.|STZ-induced diabetic rats showed a significant elevation in the serum levels of AST, ALT, ALP and FBG, whereas there was a significant decrease in serum levels of insulin, albumin, HDL-c and TP (P<0.05). Treatment of the diabetic rats with RJ restored the changes of the above parameters to their normal levels (P<0.05). In addition, RJ significantly improved reduced levels of FRAP and CAT as well as high MDA level in liver and pancreas (P<0.05).|RJ improves oxidative damage induced by STZ in the liver and pancreas of rats; therefore, it can be considered as an effective and alternative treatment for diabetes.",nonCancer
51,A genetic progression model of Braf(V600E)-induced intestinal tumorigenesis reveals targets for therapeutic intervention.,"We show that BRAF(V600E) initiates an alternative pathway to colorectal cancer (CRC), which progresses through a hyperplasia/adenoma/carcinoma sequence. This pathway underlies significant subsets of CRCs with distinctive pathomorphologic/genetic/epidemiologic/clinical characteristics. Genetic and functional analyses in mice revealed a series of stage-specific molecular alterations driving different phases of tumor evolution and uncovered mechanisms underlying this stage specificity. We further demonstrate dose-dependent effects of oncogenic signaling, with physiologic Braf(V600E) expression being sufficient for hyperplasia induction, but later stage intensified Mapk-signaling driving both tumor progression and activation of intrinsic tumor suppression. Such phenomena explain, for example, the inability of p53 to restrain tumor initiation as well as its importance in invasiveness control, and the late stage specificity of its somatic mutation. Finally, systematic drug screening revealed sensitivity of this CRC subtype to targeted therapeutics, including Mek or combinatorial PI3K/Braf inhibition.",cancer
47,BRAF gene amplification can promote acquired resistance to MEK inhibitors in cancer cells harboring the BRAF V600E mutation.,"Oncogenic BRAF mutations are found in several tumor types, including melanomas and colorectal cancers. Tumors with BRAF mutations have increased mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activity and heightened sensitivity to BRAF and MEK (mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase kinase) inhibitors. To identify potential mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we generated clones resistant to the allosteric MEK inhibitor AZD6244 from two BRAF V600E mutant colorectal cancer cell lines that are highly sensitive to MEK or BRAF inhibition. These AZD6244-resistant (AR) clones, which exhibited cross-resistance to BRAF inhibitors, acquired resistance through amplification of the BRAF gene. A small percentage of treatment-naïve parental cells showed preexisting BRAF amplification. We observed similar amplification in a subset of cells in a BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. In cell lines, BRAF amplification increased the abundance of phosphorylated MEK and impaired the ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation. The ability of AZD6244 to inhibit ERK phosphorylation in AR cells was restored by treatment with a BRAF inhibitor at low concentrations that reduced the abundance of phosphorylated MEK to amounts observed in parental cells. Combined MEK and BRAF inhibition fully overcame resistance to MEK or BRAF inhibitors alone and was also more effective in parental cells compared to treatment with either inhibitor alone. These findings implicate BRAF amplification as a mechanism of resistance to both MEK and BRAF inhibitors and suggest combined MEK and BRAF inhibition as a clinical strategy to overcome, or possibly prevent, this mechanism of resistance.",cancer
1896,"Homocysteine and hydrogen sulfide in epigenetic, metabolic and microbiota related renovascular hypertension.","Over the past several years, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) has been shown to be an important player in a variety of physiological functions, including neuromodulation, vasodilation, oxidant regulation, inflammation, and angiogenesis. H2S is synthesized primarily through metabolic processes from the amino acid cysteine and homocysteine in various organ systems including neuronal, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and kidney. Derangement of cysteine and homocysteine metabolism and clearance, particularly in the renal vasculature, leads to H2S biosynthesis deregulation causing or contributing to existing high blood pressure. While a variety of environmental influences, such as diet can have an effect on H2S regulation and function, genetic factors, and more recently epigenetics, also have a vital role in H2S regulation and function, and therefore disease initiation and progression. In addition, new research into the role of gut microbiota in the development of hypertension has highlighted the need to further explore these microorganisms and how they influence the levels of H2S throughout the body and possibly exploiting microbiota for use of hypertension treatment. In this review, we summarize recent advances in the field of hypertension research emphasizing renal contribution and how H2S physiology can be exploited as a possible therapeutic strategy to ameliorate kidney dysfunction as well as to control blood pressure.",nonCancer
2345,Chinese Helicobacter pylori vaccine: Solution for an old challenge?,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is an important cause for gastric cancer in high risk individuals. H. pylori colonizes more than 50% of the world's population and associated peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancy have important public health implications. It has been classified as a class I carcinogen in 1994 by the World Health Organization. Clinicians are often prompted to eliminate the infection the moment it is detected. This also, unfortunately, led to reckless use of antibiotics and reports of increasing resistance are now worldwide. Each year, many of people die from gastric cancer; thus application of effective vaccine can reduce this relatively high mortality worldwide. H. pylori can be eliminated by antibiotics but efficacy is sharply decreasing. Moreover, current therapy is also expensive and with side effects. Vaccine may be the best solution to the above problem but there are many challenges in producing such an effective therapeutic vaccine. Recently, the Chinese group published in Lancet, a single-center, randomized, phase III study of an oral recombinant vaccine (Urease B subunit fused with heat-labile enterotoxin B derived from Escherichia coli) prescribed in the Chinese children (6-15 years) without a history of H. pylori infection.

420,TOPK promotes lung cancer resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors by phosphorylating and activating c-Jun.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have shown promising clinical efficacy in non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); however, resistance is frequently observed in malignant cells, operating through a mechanism that remains largely unknown. The present study shows that T-lymphokine-activated killer cell-originated protein kinase (TOPK) is upregulated in NSCLC and excessively activated in TKI-refractory cells. TOPK dictates the responsiveness of lung cancers to the EGFR-targeted TKI gefitinib through the transcription factor AP-1 component c-Jun. TOPK binds directly to and phosphorylates c-Jun, which consequently activates the transcription of AP-1 target genes, including CCND1 and CDC2. TOPK silencing sensitizes EGFR-TKI-resistant lung cancer cells to gefitinib and increases gefitinib efficacy in preclinical lung adenocarcinoma xenograft models. These findings represent a novel mechanism of lung cancer resistance to TKIs and suggest that TOPK may have value both as a predictive biomarker and as a therapeutic target: TOPK-targeted therapy may synergize with EGFR-targeted therapy in lung cancers.",cancer
538,Melanoma-specific MHC-II expression represents a tumour-autonomous phenotype and predicts response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy.,"Anti-PD-1 therapy yields objective clinical responses in 30-40% of advanced melanoma patients. Since most patients do not respond, predictive biomarkers to guide treatment selection are needed. We hypothesize that MHC-I/II expression is required for tumour antigen presentation and may predict anti-PD-1 therapy response. In this study, across 60 melanoma cell lines, we find bimodal expression patterns of MHC-II, while MHC-I expression was ubiquitous. A unique subset of melanomas are capable of expressing MHC-II under basal or IFNγ-stimulated conditions. Using pathway analysis, we show that MHC-II(+) cell lines demonstrate signatures of 'PD-1 signalling', 'allograft rejection' and 'T-cell receptor signalling', among others. In two independent cohorts of anti-PD-1-treated melanoma patients, MHC-II positivity on tumour cells is associated with therapeutic response, progression-free and overall survival, as well as CD4(+) and CD8(+) tumour infiltrate. MHC-II(+) tumours can be identified by melanoma-specific immunohistochemistry using commercially available antibodies for HLA-DR to improve anti-PD-1 patient selection.",cancer
2156,Genomic architecture of heterosis for yield traits in rice.,"Increasing grain yield is a long-term goal in crop breeding to meet the demand for global food security. Heterosis, when a hybrid shows higher performance for a trait than both parents, offers an important strategy for crop breeding. To examine the genetic basis of heterosis for yield in rice, here we generate, sequence and record the phenotypes of 10,074 F2 lines from 17 representative hybrid rice crosses. We classify modern hybrid rice varieties into three groups, representing different hybrid breeding systems. Although we do not find any heterosis-associated loci shared across all lines, within each group, a small number of genomic loci from female parents explain a large proportion of the yield advantage of hybrids over their male parents. For some of these loci, we find support for partial dominance of heterozygous locus for yield-related traits and better-parent heterosis for overall performance when all of the grain-yield traits are considered together. These results inform on the genomic architecture of heterosis and rice hybrid breeding.",nonCancer
1155,Oncogenic BRAF is required for tumor growth and maintenance in melanoma models.,"The usual paradigm for developing kinase inhibitors in oncology is to use a high-affinity proof-of-concept inhibitor with acceptable metabolic properties for key target validation experiments. This approach requires substantial medicinal chemistry and can be confounded by drug toxicity and off-target activities of the test molecule. As a better alternative, we have developed inducible short-hairpin RNA xenograft models to examine the in vivo efficacy of inhibiting oncogenic BRAF. Our results show that tumor regression resulting from BRAF suppression is inducible, reversible, and tightly regulated in these models. Analysis of regressing tumors showed the primary mechanism of action for BRAF to be increased tumor cell proliferation and survival. In a metastatic melanoma model, conditional BRAF suppression slowed systemic tumor growth as determined by in vivo bioluminescence imaging. Taken together, gain-of-function BRAF signaling is strongly associated with in vivo tumorigenicity, confirming BRAF as an important target for small-molecule and RNA interference-based therapeutics.",cancer
1465,Transthoracic Echocardiography and Chest Computed Tomography Arteriography in Patients with Acute Pulmonary Embolism: A Two-Year Follow-Up Study.,"Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is frequently found at the time of diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE). An incomplete resolution of PE can lead to chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTPH). Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is the first step to diagnose an abnormality of the pulmonary vasculature. Based on computed tomography (CT), the Qanadli vascular obstruction index has been extensively used to assess acute PE.|Our aim was to ascertain whether at the time of diagnosis of an acute PE episode TTE variables and a Qanadli CT index score may be associated with CTPH 2 years later.|Patients with PE were prospectively enrolled. TTE was performed and the Qanadli CT obstruction index was calculated on admission to the hospital, while only TTE was repeated at the 2-year follow-up. The NYHA (New York Heart Association) functional classification was evaluated. Correlation analyses were performed.|Twenty patients (11 males, median age 69.5 years) were considered for the study. There was no significant correlation between TTE parameters and the Qanadli CT obstruction index. A significant distribution (χ2 = 5.69, p = 0.017) was found in the analysis among patients with CTPH at 24 months and the Qanadli CT index, categorized by a receiver operating characteristic curve cutoff value of 42.5%. Additionally, a significant distribution (χ2 = 4.09, p = 0.043) was found in the analysis among patients with CTPH at 24 months and right ventricular systolic pressure on admission, categorized as PH (>31 mm Hg).|Our study demonstrates that in patients with acute PE there is no relationship between the Qanadli CT obstruction index and TTE parameters on admission to the hospital. However, the occurrence of CTPH at the 24-month follow-up is associated with PH and with a high Qanadli CT obstruction index score.",nonCancer
1700,Stabilization of Transfected Cells Expressing Low-Incidence Blood Group Antigens: Novel Methods Facilitating Their Use as Reagent-Cells.,"The identification of erythrocyte antibodies in the serum of patients rely on panels of human red blood cells (RBCs), which coexpress many antigens and are not easily available for low-incidence blood group phenotypes. These problems have been addressed by generating cell lines expressing unique blood group antigens, which may be used as an alternative to human RBCs. However, the use of cell lines implies several drawbacks, like the requirement of cell culture facilities and the high cost of cryopreservation. The application of cell stabilization methods could facilitate their use as reagent cells in clinical laboratories.|We generated stably-transfected cells expressing low-incidence blood group antigens (Dia and Lua). High-expresser clones were used to assess the effect of TransFix® treatment and lyophilization as cell preservation methods. Cells were kept at 4°C and cell morphology, membrane permeability and antigenic properties were evaluated at several time-points after treatment.|TransFix® addition to cell suspensions allows cell stabilization and proper antigen detection for at least 120 days, despite an increase in membrane permeability and a reduction in antigen expression levels. Lyophilized cells showed minor morphological changes and antigen expression levels were rather conserved at days 1, 15 and 120, indicating a high stability of the freeze-dried product. These stabilized cells have been proved to react specifically with human sera containing alloantibodies.|Both stabilization methods allow long-term preservation of the transfected cells antigenic properties and may facilitate their distribution and use as reagent-cells expressing low-incidence antigens, overcoming the limited availability of such rare RBCs.",nonCancer
854,Integrative clinical genomics of advanced prostate cancer.,"Toward development of a precision medicine framework for metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), we established a multi-institutional clinical sequencing infrastructure to conduct prospective whole-exome and transcriptome sequencing of bone or soft tissue tumor biopsies from a cohort of 150 mCRPC affected individuals. Aberrations of AR, ETS genes, TP53, and PTEN were frequent (40%-60% of cases), with TP53 and AR alterations enriched in mCRPC compared to primary prostate cancer. We identified new genomic alterations in PIK3CA/B, R-spondin, BRAF/RAF1, APC, β-catenin, and ZBTB16/PLZF. Moreover, aberrations of BRCA2, BRCA1, and ATM were observed at substantially higher frequencies (19.3% overall) compared to those in primary prostate cancers. 89% of affected individuals harbored a clinically actionable aberration, including 62.7% with aberrations in AR, 65% in other cancer-related genes, and 8% with actionable pathogenic germline alterations.

923,CALR and ASXL1 mutations-based molecular prognostication in primary myelofibrosis: an international study of 570 patients.,"Current prognostication in primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is based on the dynamic international prognostic scoring system (DIPSS)-plus, which employs clinical and cytogenetic variables. We recently reported DIPSS-plus independent prognostic significance for calreticulin (CALR) (favorable) and ASXL1 (unfavorable) mutations. In the current study, 570 PMF patients were recruited for derivation (n=277) and validation (n=293) of a molecular prognostic model based on these two mutations. Survival was the longest in CALR(+)ASXL1(-) (median 10.4 years) and shortest in CALR(-)ASXL1(+) patients (median, 2.3 years; hazard ratio (HR), 5.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.5-10.0). CALR(+)ASXL1(+) and CALR(-)ASXL1(-) patients had similar survival and were grouped together in an intermediate-risk category (median survival, 5.8 years; HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.0). The CALR/ASXL1 mutations-based prognostic model was DIPSS-plus independent (P<0.0001) and effective in identifying low-/intermediate-1-risk patients with shorter (median, 4 years) or longer (median 20 years) survival and high-/intermediate-2-risk patients with shorter (median, 2.3 years) survival. Multivariable analysis distinguished CALR(-)ASXL1(+) mutational status as the most significant risk factor for survival: HR 3.7 vs 2.8 for age >65 years vs 2.7 for unfavorable karyotype. These observations signify immediate clinical relevance and warrant i) CALR and ASXL1 mutation determination in all patients with PMF and ii) molecular revision of DIPSS-plus.",cancer
139,Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase mutations identified in human cancer are oncogenic.,"Mutations in genes that encode components of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) signaling pathway are common in human cancer. The recent discovery of nonrandom somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene of many human tumors suggests an oncogenic role for the mutated enzyme. We have determined the growth-regulatory and signaling properties of the three most frequently observed PI3-kinase mutations: E542K, E545K, and H1047R. Expressed in chicken embryo fibroblasts, all three mutants induce oncogenic transformation with high efficiency. This transforming ability is correlated with elevated catalytic activity in in vitro kinase assays. The mutant-transformed cells show constitutive phosphorylation of Akt, of p70 S6 kinase, and of the 4E-binding protein 1. Phosphorylation of S6 kinase and of 4E-binding protein 1 is regulated by the target of rapamycin (TOR) kinase and affects rates of protein synthesis. The inhibitor of TOR, rapamycin, strongly interferes with cellular transformation induced by the PI3-kinase mutants, suggesting that the TOR and its downstream targets are essential components of the transformation process. The oncogenic transforming activity makes the mutated PI3-kinase proteins promising targets for small molecule inhibitors that could be developed into effective and highly specific anticancer drugs.",cancer
1813,Therapeutic targeting of splicing in cancer.,"Recent studies have highlighted that splicing patterns are frequently altered in cancer and that mutations in genes encoding spliceosomal proteins, as well as mutations affecting the splicing of key cancer-associated genes, are enriched in cancer. In parallel, there is also accumulating evidence that several molecular subtypes of cancer are highly dependent on splicing function for cell survival. These findings have resulted in a growing interest in targeting splicing catalysis, splicing regulatory proteins, and/or specific key altered splicing events in the treatment of cancer. Here we present strategies that exist and that are in development to target altered dependency on the spliceosome, as well as aberrant splicing, in cancer. These include drugs to target global splicing in cancer subtypes that are preferentially dependent on wild-type splicing for survival, methods to alter post-translational modifications of splicing-regulating proteins, and strategies to modulate pathologic splicing events and protein-RNA interactions in cancer.",nonCancer
506,Dasatinib sensitizes KRAS mutant colorectal tumors to cetuximab.,"KRAS mutation is a predictive biomarker for resistance to cetuximab (Erbitux) in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). This study sought to determine if KRAS mutant CRC lines could be sensitized to cetuximab using dasatinib (BMS-354825, Sprycel), a potent, orally bioavailable inhibitor of several tyrosine kinases, including the Src family kinases (SFKs). We analyzed 16 CRC lines for: (1) KRAS mutation status, (2) dependence on mutant KRAS signaling and (3) expression level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and SFKs. From these analyses, we selected three KRAS mutant (LS180, LoVo and HCT116) cell lines and two KRAS wild-type cell lines (SW48 and CaCo2). In vitro, using poly-D-lysine/laminin plates, KRAS mutant cell lines were resistant to cetuximab, whereas KRAS wild-type lines showed sensitivity to cetuximab. Treatment with cetuximab and dasatinib showed a greater antiproliferative effect on KRAS mutant lines when compared with either agent alone in vitro and in vivo. To investigate potential mechanisms for this antiproliferative response in the combinatorial therapy, we performed Human Phospho-Kinase Antibody Array analysis, measuring the relative phosphorylation levels of 39 intracellular proteins in untreated, cetuximab, dasatinib or the combinatorial treatment in the KRAS mutant lines LS180, LoVo and HCT116 cells. The results of this experiment showed a decrease in a broad spectrum of kinases centered on the β-catenin pathway, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and the family of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) when compared with the untreated control or monotherapy treatments. Next, we analyzed tumor growth with cetuximab, dasatinib or their combination in vivo. KRAS mutant xenografts showed resistance to cetuximab therapy, whereas KRAS wild type demonstrated an antitumor response when treated with cetuximab. KRAS mutant tumors exhibited minimal response to dasatinib monotherapy. However, as in vitro, KRAS mutant lines exhibited a response to the combination of cetuximab and dasatinib. Combinatorial treatment of KRAS mutant xenografts resulted in decreased cell proliferation, as measured by Ki67, and higher rates of apoptosis, as measured by TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling). The data presented in this study indicate that dasatinib can sensitize KRAS mutant CRC tumors to cetuximab and may do so by altering the activity of several key signaling pathways. Furthermore, these results suggest that signaling via EGFR and SFKs may be necessary for cell proliferation and survival of KRAS mutant CRC tumors. These data strengthen the rationale for clinical trials combining cetuximab and dasatinib in the KRAS mutant CRC genetic setting.",cancer
1103,A melanocyte lineage program confers resistance to MAP kinase pathway inhibition.,"Malignant melanomas harbouring point mutations (Val600Glu) in the serine/threonine-protein kinase BRAF (BRAF(V600E)) depend on RAF-MEK-ERK signalling for tumour cell growth. RAF and MEK inhibitors show remarkable clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) melanoma; however, resistance to these agents remains a formidable challenge. Global characterization of resistance mechanisms may inform the development of more effective therapeutic combinations. Here we carried out systematic gain-of-function resistance studies by expressing more than 15,500 genes individually in a BRAF(V600E) melanoma cell line treated with RAF, MEK, ERK or combined RAF-MEK inhibitors. These studies revealed a cyclic-AMP-dependent melanocytic signalling network not previously associated with drug resistance, including G-protein-coupled receptors, adenyl cyclase, protein kinase A and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Preliminary analysis of biopsies from BRAF(V600E) melanoma patients revealed that phosphorylated (active) CREB was suppressed by RAF-MEK inhibition but restored in relapsing tumours. Expression of transcription factors activated downstream of MAP kinase and cAMP pathways also conferred resistance, including c-FOS, NR4A1, NR4A2 and MITF. Combined treatment with MAPK-pathway and histone-deacetylase inhibitors suppressed MITF expression and cAMP-mediated resistance. Collectively, these data suggest that oncogenic dysregulation of a melanocyte lineage dependency can cause resistance to RAF-MEK-ERK inhibition, which may be overcome by combining signalling- and chromatin-directed therapeutics.",cancer

We undertook a multicenter phase I two-part study (dose escalation and cohort expansion). Here, we present the part 2 expansion that included melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and colorectal cancer with oral RO4987655 administered continuously at recommended doses of 8.5 mg twice daily until progressive disease (PD). Sequential tumor sampling investigated multiple markers of pathway activation/tumor effects, including ERK phosphorylation and Ki-67 expression. BRAF and KRAS testing were implemented as selection criteria and broader tumor mutational analysis added. Ninety-five patients received RO4987655, including 18 BRAF-mutant melanoma, 23 BRAF wild-type melanoma, 24 KRAS-mutant NSCLC, and 30 KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. Most frequent adverse events were rash, acneiform dermatitis, and gastrointestinal disorders, mostly grade 1/2. Four (24%) of 17 BRAF-mutated melanoma had partial response as did four (20%) of 20 BRAF wild-type melanoma and two (11%) of 18 KRAS-mutant NSCLC. All KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer developed PD. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation among all cohorts but significant differences among cohorts in Ki-67 modulation. Sixty-nine percent showed a decrease in fluorodeoxyglucose uptake between baseline and day 15. Detailed mutational profiling confirmed RAS/RAF screening and identified additional aberrations (NRAS/non-BRAF melanomas; PIK3CA/KRAS colorectal cancer) without therapeutic implications. Safety profile of RO4987655 was comparable with other MEK inhibitors. Single-agent activity was observed in all entities except colorectal cancer. Evidence of target modulation and early biologic activity was shown among all indications independent of mutational status. Clin Cancer Res; 20(16); 4251-61. ©2014 AACR.",cancer
247,TERT promoter mutation status as an independent prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma.,"Recently, TERT promoter mutations were identified at high frequencies in cutaneous melanoma tumor samples and cell lines. The mutations were found to have a UV-signature and to lead to increased TERT gene expression. We analyzed a large cohort of melanoma patients for the presence and distribution of TERT promoter mutations and their association with clinico-pathological characteristics. 410 melanoma tumor samples were analyzed by Sanger sequencing for the presence of TERT promoter mutations. An analysis of associations between mutation status and various clinical and pathologic variables was performed. TERT promoter mutations were identified in 154 (43%) of 362 successfully sequenced melanomas. Mutation frequencies varied between melanoma subtype, being most frequent in melanomas arising in nonacral skin (48%) and melanomas with occult primary (50%), and less frequent in mucosal (23%), and acral (19%) melanomas. Mutations carried a UV signature (C>T or CC>TT). The presence of TERT promoter mutations was associated with factors such as BRAF or NRAS mutation (P < .001), histologic type (P = .002), and Breslow thickness (P < .001). TERT promoter mutation was independently associated with poorer overall survival in patients with nonacral cutaneous melanomas (median survival 80 months vs 291 months for wild-type; hazard ratio corrected for other covariates 2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.29 to 4.74; P = .006). UV-induced TERT promoter mutations are one of the most frequent genetic alterations in melanoma, with frequencies varying depending on melanoma subtype. In nonacral cutaneous melanomas, presence of TERT promoter mutations is independently associated with poor prognosis.",cancer
609,Hedgehog pathway inhibitor saridegib (IPI-926) increases lifespan in a mouse medulloblastoma model.,"The Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) pathway drives a subset of medulloblastomas, a malignant neuroectodermal brain cancer, and other cancers. Small-molecule Shh pathway inhibitors have induced tumor regression in mice and patients with medulloblastoma; however, drug resistance rapidly emerges, in some cases via de novo mutation of the drug target. Here we assess the response and resistance mechanisms to the natural product derivative saridegib in an aggressive Shh-driven mouse medulloblastoma model. In this model, saridegib treatment induced tumor reduction and significantly prolonged survival. Furthermore, the effect of saridegib on tumor-initiating capacity was demonstrated by reduced tumor incidence, slower growth, and spontaneous tumor regression that occurred in allografts generated from previously treated autochthonous medulloblastomas compared with those from untreated donors. Saridegib, a known P-glycoprotein (Pgp) substrate, induced Pgp activity in treated tumors, which likely contributed to emergence of drug resistance. Unlike other Smoothened (Smo) inhibitors, the drug resistance was neither mutation-dependent nor Gli2 amplification-dependent, and saridegib was found to be active in cells with the D473H point mutation that rendered them resistant to another Smo inhibitor, GDC-0449. The fivefold increase in lifespan in mice treated with saridegib as a single agent compares favorably with both targeted and cytotoxic therapies. The absence of genetic mutations that confer resistance distinguishes saridegib from other Smo inhibitors.",cancer

For female genital prolapse, sacrocolpopexy is the gold standard. Laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy is a relatively new and promising technique correcting rectal prolapse. There is no literature combining the 2 robotically assisted techniques.|This study was designed to evaluate the safety, quality of life, and functional and sexual outcomes of robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy for multicompartment prolapse of the pelvic floor.|This was a prospective, observational cohort study.|The study was conducted in a tertiary care setting.|All sexually active patients undergoing robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy at our institution between 2012 and 2014 were included.|Robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy was the study intervention.|Preoperative and postoperative (12 months) questionnaires using the Urinary Distress Inventory, Pescatori Incontinence Scale, Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire, and Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire were completed. In addition Wexner and Vaizey incontinence scores and the Wexner constipation score were recorded postoperatively.|Fifty-one patients underwent robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy (median follow-up, 12.5 months). The simplified Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification improved significantly (p < 0.0005) for all 4 of the anatomic landmarks. Both median fecal (preoperative and postoperative Pescatori 4 vs 3, p = 0.002) and urinary incontinence scores (Urinary Distress Inventory, 27.8 vs 22.2; p < 0.0005) improved significantly at 12 months. Postoperatively median Wexner (3) and Vaizey incontinence (6) and Wexner Constipation (7) scores were noted. A positive effect on sexual function (Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire score 31.8 vs 35.9; p = 0.002) and quality of life for each compartment (p < 0.0005) was observed. One patient (2%) developed mesh erosion. No multicompartment recurrences were detected.|This was a observational study with a limited follow-up, no control group, and no preoperatively validated constipation score.|Robot-assisted sacrocolporectopexy is a safe and effective technique for multicompartment prolapse in terms of functional outcome, quality of life, and sexual function.",nonCancer
2464,Overexpression of miR-506 suppresses proliferation and promotes apoptosis of osteosarcoma cells by targeting astrocyte elevated gene-1.,"There is increasing evidence that microRNAs (miRs) are implicated in tumor development and progression; however, their specific roles in osteosarcoma are not well understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of miR-506 in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. The expression levels of miR-506 and astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) mRNA were detected using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the protein levels of AEG-1, β-catenin, c-myc and cyclin D1 were determined using western blot analysis. The effects of miR-506 and AEG-1 on cell viability, colony forming ability and apoptosis were assessed using MTT assay, colony formation assay, and flow cytometry, respectively. Lucifer reporter assays were used to demonstrate whether AEG-1 is a direct target of miR-506. The present study identified that miR-506 was downregulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cells. Overexpression of miR-506 suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells in vitro and inhibited tumor formation in vivo. Overexpression of miR-506 significantly inhibited the luciferase activity of AEG-1 with a wild-type 3'-untranslated region, providing clear evidence that AEG-1 was a direct and functional downstream target of miR-506. Similar to the overexpression of miR-506, downregulation of AEG-1 lead to an inhibitory effect on osteosarcoma in vitro. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-506 or downregulation of AEG-1 inhibited the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and inhibition of this pathway by β-catenin small interfering RNA or CGP049090, a small molecule inhibitor, suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in vitro. Overall, the present data indicated that miR-506 functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting AEG-1 in osteosarcoma via the regulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.",nonCancer
2446,Trastuzumab as a preoperative monotherapy does not inhibit HER2 downstream signaling in HER2-positive breast cancer.,"Human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) is overexpressed in 15-20% of breast carcinomas. The overexpression of HER2 was previously associated with a poor prognosis until the development of the first anti-HER2 therapy, trastuzumab, which drastically improves the prognosis of HER2-overexpressing breast cancers. However, its mechanism of action remains not fully understood. Several studies have proposed that the behavior and mechanism of action of trastuzumab may be drastically altered in vitro and in vivo. The present study assesses the ability of trastuzumab to inhibit the phosphorylation of the key-proteins of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mechanistic target of rapamycin and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in vitro, in breast cancer cell lines and in tumor biopsies obtained from patients treated with trastuzumab preoperative monotherapy as part of the Unicancer GEP04 RADHER phase II clinical trial. HER2-positive SKBR3 and HER2-negative MCF-7 cell lines were exposed to trastuzumab for 72 h. In total, 41 patients received trastuzumab alone for 6 weeks of preoperative treatment. Biopsies were collected at the baseline and at surgery. A total of 19 pairs of associated baseline and surgery tumor specimens were eligible for protein extraction and comparative phosphoprotein expression analysis, prior to and subsequent to treatment. The expression of phosphoproteins was quantitatively assessed using a multiplex immunoassay. In the SKBR3 cell line, a statistically significant decrease of the expression level of phosphorylated (p-)AKT, p-ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1, p-extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 and p-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 was observed after exposure to trastuzumab. In contrast, no statistically significant variations for levels expression of these phosphoproteins were observed in patients following treatment. The lack of downregulation of PI3K and MAPK pathways could probably be explained by the implementation of a predominant immunological mechanism of action for trastuzumab, a type of antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity, which has previously been reported in preoperative monotherapy settings. The present study confirms that trastuzumab involves various modes of action when assayed in vitro and used clinically.",nonCancer
2081,Push and pull: Exposure of young Taiwanese women to sexually explicit materials.,"This study was designed to understand young Taiwanese women's perception of sexually explicit materials (SEMs). Researchers conducted six focus group discussions with 38 young women between the ages of 18 and 22 in Taiwan in 2009-2010 and used content analysis to analyze the data based on the push-pull theory. The results showed that the exposure of young women to SEMs was a sexual exploration process from no sexual activity to future sexual activity. This process was affected by the interactions of three powers: push power, pull power, and personal factors. The push power included factors, such as parents and social values, which failed to satisfy their sexual curiosity and provide them with autonomy. The pull power included SEMs and peer influence, which increased sexual arousal stimuli and curiosity to try sexual activity. The most important personal factors were young women's growth, including sexual curiosity, cognition of SEMs, and gender equity in freedom to make sexual decisions. Understanding this push-pull process regarding SEM can help health-care providers with their own discourses in addressing sex and influence young women's participation in desired, protected, and enjoyable sex when sufficiently ready.",nonCancer

2173,Anti-hepatocellular carcinoma properties of the anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram discovered to enzymatically inhibit the AMPK-related kinase SNARK in vitro.,"We recently described that the anti-apoptotic AMPK-related kinase, SNARK, promotes transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells, as a potentially new therapeutic target. Here we explored FDA-approved drugs inhibiting the enzymatic activity of SNARK, using an in vitro luminescence kinase assay system. Interestingly, the long-used anti-alcoholism drug disulfiram (DSF), also known as Antabuse, emerged as the top hit. Enzymatic kinetics analyses revealed that DSF inhibited SNARK kinase activity in a noncompetitive manner to ATP or phosphosubstrates. Comparative in vitro analyses of DSF analogs indicated the significance of the disulfide bond-based molecular integrity for the kinase inhibition. DSF suppressed SNARK-promoted TGF-β signaling and demonstrated anti-HCC effects. The chemical and enzymatic findings herein reveal novel pharmacological effects of and use for DSF and its derivatives, and could be conducive to prevention and inhibition of liver fibrosis and HCC.",nonCancer
1668,The role of endoscopic ultrasound on the preoperative T staging of gastric cancer: A retrospective study.,"Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is used for preoperative assessment of gastric cancer. However, recent studies suggested that EUS staging accuracy is lower than previously thought. We aimed to assess EUS efficacy and image characteristics in preoperative gastric cancer T staging.A retrospective review of clinical and imaging features of 232 gastric carcinoma patients who underwent preoperative EUS assessment of T stage was performed. Only cases with tumor-free resection margin status and no metastases were enrolled. Comparisons of preoperative EUS and postoperative histopathological stagings were also performed to identify vital EUS image features for evaluating gastric carcinoma.EUS accuracy for T staging was 64.2% (149/232) with the highest accuracy for T3 (75.0%). Enlarged lymph nodes, well differentiated histological type and Borrmann IV type were associated with diagnostic accuracy in predicting tumor invasion. Although no factors were associated with overstaging, circumferential lesions ≥1/2, signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, and Borrmann IV type had significantly higher risks of understaging. Gastric wall outer edge irregularity was also an indicator of serosal involvement with a sensitivity of 82.0%. The pancreas and colon were more frequent disease extension sites than previously predicted.Although EUS is likely the best and most accurate option that we have used to stage gastric cancer, the finding that factors including circumferential lesions, signet ring cell adenocarcinoma, and Borrmann IV type carcinoma were more frequently related to incorrect staging warrants attention.",nonCancer
786,In vitro anticancer activity of PI3K alpha selective inhibitor BYL719 in head and neck cancer.,"The purpose of the present study was to explore the antiproliferative effect of BYL719, a specific inhibitor for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) p110α, in human head and neck cancer cell lines, as a single agent or in combination with the irreversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, dacomitinib. Six head and neck cancer cell lines consisting of two PIK3CA mutant cell lines, SNU-1076 and Detroit562, and four PIK3CA wild-type cell lines, SNU-1066, SNU-1041, FaDu and SCC25, were analyzed. The PIK3CA-mutant cell lines were more sensitive to BYL719 than the PIK3CA wild-type cell lines. Following BYL719 treatment, all PIK3CA wild-type cell lines, except for the SNU-1066 cell line, exhibited higher IC50 values compared to the PIK3CA mutant cell lines. Administration of BYL719 induced cell cycle G0/G1 arrest and resulted in increased apoptosis in a dose-dependant manner. Furthermore, the administration of BYL719 reduced the level of p-mTOR, p-AKT and p-S6 expression indicating the down-regulation of downstream signaling. BYL719, a PI3K alpha selective blocker, could be a promising factor in the treatment of head and neck cancer either as a single agent or in combination with dacomitinib.",cancer
1023,Molecular genetic characterization of the genomic ACTB-GLI fusion in pericytoma with t(7;12).,"""Pericytoma with t(7;12)"" is a newly defined soft tissue tumor characterized by fusion of the ACTB and GLI genes through the translocation t(7;12)(p22;q13). Recently, we reported the structure of the ACTB-GLI and GLI-ACTB fusion transcripts in five cases, and herein the corresponding genomic breakpoints were investigated. Overall, the findings at the DNA level corresponded well with the structure of the expressed transcripts. In three cases, the fusions were due to junction of intronic sequences, in two cases breakpoints were found in exonic sequences. In four cases the fusions corresponded to the juxtapositioning of unaltered DNA sequences, and in one case, a micro-inversion was found at the junction. All five fusions were molecularly unbalanced, including the two cases with reciprocal GLI-ACTB chimeras. Whereas large repeats or recombinase recognition sequences were not detected, sequences of shared oligonucleotides, possibly important for recombination, were found in the proximity of the respective breakpoints.",cancer
1237,O-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) mRNA expression predicts outcome in malignant glioma independent of MGMT promoter methylation.,"We analyzed prospectively whether MGMT (O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) mRNA expression gains prognostic/predictive impact independent of MGMT promoter methylation in malignant glioma patients undergoing radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide or temozolomide alone. As DNA-methyltransferases (DNMTs) are the enzymes responsible for setting up and maintaining DNA methylation patterns in eukaryotic cells, we analyzed further, whether MGMT promoter methylation is associated with upregulation of DNMT expression. ADULT PATIENTS WITH A HISTOLOGICALLY PROVEN MALIGNANT ASTROCYTOMA (GLIOBLASTOMA: N = 53, anaplastic astrocytoma: N = 10) were included. MGMT promoter methylation was determined by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sequencing analysis. Expression of MGMT and DNMTs mRNA were analysed by real-time qPCR. Prognostic factors were obtained from proportional hazards models. Correlation between MGMT mRNA expression and MGMT methylation status was validated using data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database (N = 229 glioblastomas). Low MGMT mRNA expression was strongly predictive for prolonged time to progression, treatment response, and length of survival in univariate and multivariate models (p<0.0001); the degree of MGMT mRNA expression was highly correlated with the MGMT promoter methylation status (p<0.0001); however, discordant findings were seen in 12 glioblastoma patients: Patients with methylated tumors with high MGMT mRNA expression (N = 6) did significantly worse than those with low transcriptional activity (p<0.01). Conversely, unmethylated tumors with low MGMT mRNA expression (N = 6) did better than their counterparts. A nearly identical frequency of concordant and discordant findings was obtained by analyzing the TCGA database (p<0.0001). Expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3b was strongly upregulated in tumor tissue, but not correlated with MGMT promoter methylation and MGMT mRNA expression. MGMT mRNA expression plays a direct role for mediating tumor sensitivity to alkylating agents. Discordant findings indicate methylation-independent pathways of MGMT expression regulation. DNMT1 and DNMT3b are likely to be involved in CGI methylation. However, their exact role yet has to be defined.",cancer
2186,Sensitivity to Enterocins of Thermophilic Campylobacter spp. from Different Poultry Species.,"Campylobacter spp. have been isolated from various animals, including poultry. They are rapidly transmitted throughout broiler sheds by the fecal-oral route. A promising strategy to reduce Campylobacter spp. in poultry may be done due to the beneficial properties of probiotic bacteria and their bacteriocins. In this study, inhibition spectrum/activity of different enterocins was evaluated against Campylobacter spp. (isolated from different poultry) to indicate further practical use of enterocins. Enterocins are antimicrobial proteinaceous substances produced mostly by enterococci. Feces from broiler chickens (10), laying hens (47), ostriches (140), and ducks (40) were screened. Altogether, 23 strains were allotted to the species Campylobacter jejuni and Campylobacter coli using MALDI TOF mass spectrometry and confirmed by genotyping (PCR method). In the feces of ostriches, Campylobacter spp. were not confirmed. Campylobacter spp. isolated from different poultry showed resistance to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin, and ampicillin. Interestingly, strains demonstrating antibiotic resistance revealed sensitivity to at least one of the nine enterocins used (except C. coli Kc1, SZ3, and C. jejuni 1/D). Almost 52% strains were inhibited by Ent A (P). Enterocins can therefore be used to prevent or reduce Campylobacter spp.; it is a basis for practical use.",nonCancer
477,Inhibition of ATP citrate lyase induces an anticancer effect via reactive oxygen species: AMPK as a predictive biomarker for therapeutic impact.,"De novo lipogenesis is activated in most cancers. Inhibition of ATP citrate lyase (ACLY), the enzyme that catalyzes the first step of de novo lipogenesis, leads to growth suppression and apoptosis in a subset of human cancer cells. Herein, we found that ACLY depletion increases the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas addition of an antioxidant reduced ROS and attenuated the anticancer effect. ACLY depletion or exogenous hydrogen peroxide induces phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), a crucial regulator of lipid metabolism, independently of energy status. Analysis of various cancer cell lines revealed that cancer cells with a higher susceptibility to ACLY depletion have lower levels of basal ROS and p-AMPK. Mitochondrial-deficient ρ(0) cells retained high levels of ROS and p-AMPK and were resistant to ACLY depletion, whereas the replenishment of normal mitochondrial DNA reduced the levels of ROS and p-AMPK and restored the sensitivity to ACLY depletion, indicating that low basal levels of mitochondrial ROS are critical for the anticancer effect of ACLY depletion. Finally, p-AMPK levels were significantly correlated to the levels of oxidative DNA damage in colon cancer tissues, suggesting that p-AMPK reflects cellular ROS levels in vitro and in vivo. Together, these data suggest that ACLY inhibition exerts an anticancer effect via increased ROS, and p-AMPK could be a predictive biomarker for its therapeutic outcome.",cancer
268,Activating mutations in the NT5C2 nucleotidase gene drive chemotherapy resistance in relapsed ALL.,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is an aggressive hematological tumor resulting from the malignant transformation of lymphoid progenitors. Despite intensive chemotherapy, 20% of pediatric patients and over 50% of adult patients with ALL do not achieve a complete remission or relapse after intensified chemotherapy, making disease relapse and resistance to therapy the most substantial challenge in the treatment of this disease. Using whole-exome sequencing, we identify mutations in the cytosolic 5'-nucleotidase II gene (NT5C2), which encodes a 5'-nucleotidase enzyme that is responsible for the inactivation of nucleoside-analog chemotherapy drugs, in 20/103 (19%) relapse T cell ALLs and 1/35 (3%) relapse B-precursor ALLs. NT5C2 mutant proteins show increased nucleotidase activity in vitro and conferred resistance to chemotherapy with 6-mercaptopurine and 6-thioguanine when expressed in ALL lymphoblasts. These results support a prominent role for activating mutations in NT5C2 and increased nucleoside-analog metabolism in disease progression and chemotherapy resistance in ALL.",cancer

395,p16 protein expression and human papillomavirus status as prognostic biomarkers of nonoropharyngeal head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"Although p16 protein expression, a surrogate marker of oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, is recognized as a prognostic marker in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC), its prevalence and significance have not been well established in cancer of the oral cavity, hypopharynx, or larynx, collectively referred as non-OPSCC, where HPV infection is less common than in the oropharynx. p16 expression and high-risk HPV status in non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies were determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH). Hazard ratios from Cox models were expressed as positive or negative, stratified by trial, and adjusted for clinical characteristics. p16 expression was positive in 14.1% (12 of 85), 24.2% (23 of 95), and 19.0% (27 of 142) and HPV ISH was positive in 6.5% (six of 93), 14.6% (15 of 103), and 6.9% (seven of 101) of non-OPSCCs from RTOG 0129, 0234, and 0522 studies, respectively. Hazard ratios for p16 expression were 0.63 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.95; P = .03) and 0.56 (95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89; P = .01) for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. Comparing OPSCC and non-OPSCC, patients with p16-positive OPSCC have better PFS and OS than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, but patients with p16-negative OPSCC and non-OPSCC have similar outcomes. Similar to results in patients with OPSCC, patients with p16-negative non-OPSCC have worse outcomes than patients with p16-positive non-OPSCC, and HPV may also have a role in outcome in a subset of non-OPSCC. However, further development of a p16 IHC scoring system in non-OPSCC and improvement of HPV detection methods are warranted before broad application in the clinical setting.",cancer

Patients with portal hypertension (n=53) caused by liver cirrhosis complicated by EVB and hypersplenism treated with phased joint intervention were assessed, and portal hemodynamics, blood, liver function, complications, and rebleeding incidence were analyzed. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to measure Rho, ROCK1 and ROCK2 mRNA expression levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells prior to and following phased joint intervention, and western blotting was employed to determine the protein expression levels of Rho, ROCK1, ROCK2, phosphorylated (p) myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1) and total-MYPT1. All patients underwent an emergency assessment of hemostasis with a 100% success rate. Varicose veins were alleviated, and portal hemodynamics and liver function improved following intervention. Furthermore, preoperative and postoperative expression levels of Rho, ROCK1 and ROCK2 mRNA were higher compared with the control group. Notably, the mRNA expression levels of Rho, ROCK1 and ROCK2 in the postoperative group were significantly lower when compared with the preoperative group. Protein expression levels of Rho, ROCK1, ROCK2 and pMYPT1 in the postoperative group were lower, as compared with the preoperative group. Concentration levels of transforming growth factor-β1, connective tissue growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor in peripheral blood were significantly reduced following phased joint intervention. Therefore, the present findings demonstrated that phased joint intervention is able to effectively treat EVB and hypersplenism, and improve liver function. The efficacy of phased joint intervention may be associated with its role in the regulation of the Rho-ROCK signaling pathway.",nonCancer
2217,Intrinsic spatial knowledge about terrestrial ecology favors the tall for judging distance.,"Our sense of vision reliably directs and guides our everyday actions, such as reaching and walking. This ability is especially fascinating because the optical images of natural scenes that project into our eyes are insufficient to adequately form a perceptual space. It has been proposed that the brain makes up for this inadequacy by using its intrinsic spatial knowledge. However, it is unclear what constitutes intrinsic spatial knowledge and how it is acquired. We investigated this question and showed evidence of an ecological basis, which uses the statistical spatial relationship between the observer and the terrestrial environment, namely, the ground surface. We found that in dark and reduced-cue environments where intrinsic knowledge has a greater contribution, perceived target location is more accurate when referenced to the ground than to the ceiling. Furthermore, taller observers more accurately localized the target. Superior performance was also observed in the full-cue environment, even when we compensated for the observers' heights by having the taller observer sit on a chair and the shorter observers stand on a box. Although fascinating, this finding dovetails with the prediction of the ecological hypothesis for intrinsic spatial knowledge. It suggests that an individual's accumulated lifetime experiences of being tall and his or her constant interactions with ground-based objects not only determine intrinsic spatial knowledge but also endow him or her with an advantage in spatial ability in the intermediate distance range.",nonCancer

We aimed to study the expression of TS and Topo I in patients with resected CRC who received adjuvant chemotherapy and correlated it with clinical outcome. All patients diagnosed with CRC between 1989 and 2007 and treated with adjuvant chemotherapy within Hellenic Cooperative Oncology Group's (HeCOG) protocols, were identified. Archival paraffin-embedded tumor tissues were used for immunohistochemical detection of TS and Topo I. Immunohistochemistry was performed on tissue microarray slides using monoclonal antibodies against TS and Topo I. The results were correlated with survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS). A cohort of 498 patients with a median age of 61 years and Dukes' stage B (49%) and C (51%) fulfilled the criteria of the study. All patients received adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy, 38% irinotecan-containing. Positive TS and Topo I expression was found in 43% and 48% of cases, respectively. Five-year OS was 74% and DFS was 68%. In univariate analysis no association of TS and Topo I expression with OS and DFS was identified. In multivariate analysis however, Topo I expression was associated with a reduced risk of death (HR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.42-0.88, p = 0.009). In the irinotecan-treated subgroup, those patients who expressed Topo I had a better OS (HR = 0.47, 95% CI 0.23-0.94, p = 0.033). Patients with resected CRC expressing Topo I seem to benefit from irinotecan-containing adjuvant chemotherapy. However randomised prospective trials are needed to confirm these results.",cancer

Using genomic DNA samples extracted from mononuclear cells of consecutive patients with HER2-positive MBC who received first-line TH, we analyzed five polymorphisms (ABCB1 1236C>T, ABCB1 2677G>T/A, ABCB1 3435C>T, FCGR2A 131H/R, and FCGR3A 158V/F) and then correlated them with the response rate, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and adverse events of patients. A total of 57 women were analyzed. The median age was 46 years (range 27-72). ABCB1 2677T carriers had a longer PFS (p = 0.037) along with a tendency toward a longer OS (p = 0.057). ABCB1 3435CC genotype carriers had a shorter PFS (p = 0.039) along with a tendency toward a shorter OS (p = 0.093). In combined analysis, PFS was significantly longer in ABCB1 1236CC and/or 2677TT carriers compared to the others (p = 0.006). FCGR2A 131H/R and FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms were not significantly associated with response rate, PFS, and OS. Our data support that ABCB1 polymorphisms may predict PFS after first-line TH chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive MBC. In contrast, FCGR2A 131H/R and FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms could not predict treatment outcomes.",cancer
1559,PolyICLC Exerts Pro- and Anti-HIV Effects on the DC-T Cell Milieu In Vitro and In Vivo.,"Myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) contribute to both HIV pathogenesis and elicitation of antiviral immunity. Understanding how mDC responses to stimuli shape HIV infection outcomes will inform HIV prevention and treatment strategies. The long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viral mimic, polyinosinic polycytidylic acid (polyIC, PIC) potently stimulates DCs to focus Th1 responses, triggers direct antiviral activity in vitro, and boosts anti-HIV responses in vivo. Stabilized polyICLC (PICLC) is being developed for vaccine adjuvant applications in humans, making it critical to understand how mDC sensing of PICLC influences HIV infection. Using the monocyte-derived DC (moDC) model, we sought to describe how PICLC (vs. other dsRNAs) impacts HIV infection within DCs and DC-T cell mixtures. We extended this work to in vivo macaque rectal transmission studies by administering PICLC with or before rectal SIVmac239 (SIVwt) or SIVmac239ΔNef (SIVΔNef) challenge. Like PIC, PICLC activated DCs and T cells, increased expression of α4β7 and CD169, and induced type I IFN responses in vitro. The type of dsRNA and timing of dsRNA exposure differentially impacted in vitro DC-driven HIV infection. Rectal PICLC treatment similarly induced DC and T cell activation and pro- and anti-HIV factors locally and systemically. Importantly, this did not enhance SIV transmission in vivo. Instead, SIV acquisition was marginally reduced after a single high dose challenge. Interestingly, in the PICLC-treated, SIVΔNef-infected animals, SIVΔNef viremia was higher, in line with the importance of DC and T cell activation in SIVΔNef replication. In the right combination anti-HIV strategy, PICLC has the potential to limit HIV infection and boost HIV immunity.",nonCancer

Men were sampled from military enrollment records and women from electoral records. From those initially enrolled, participants with high levels of psychiatric symptoms were oversampled for follow-up. Data analysis was performed from July 28, 2015, to June 8, 2016.|Latent trajectories, estimated using growth mixture modeling, of past-year mood/anxiety disorder (ie, major depressive episode, phobias, panic, generalized anxiety disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder), substance use disorder (ie, drug abuse or dependence and alcohol abuse or dependence), and any mental disorder (ie, any of the above) assessed during in-person semistructured interviews at each wave. Diagnoses were based on DSM-III, DSM-III-R, and DSM-IV criteria.|Of the 591 participants at baseline, 299 (50.6%) were female. Persistent mental health disorder across multiple study waves was rare. Among 252 individuals (42.6%) who participated in all 7 study waves, only 1.2% met criteria for disorder every time. Growth mixture modeling identified 3 classes of risk for any disorder across adulthood: low (estimated prevalence, 40.0%; 95% CI, -8.7% to 88.9%), increasing-decreasing (estimated prevalence, 15.3%; 95% CI, 1.0% to 29.6%), and increasing (estimated prevalence, 44.7%; 95% CI, -0.9% to 90.1%). Although no classes were characterized by persistently high disorder risk, for those in the increasing-decreasing class, risk was high from the late 20s to early 40s. Sex-specific models indicated 4 trajectory classes for women but only 3 for men.|Persistently high mental health disorder risk across 3 decades of adulthood was rare in this population-based sample. Identifying early determinants of sex-specific risk trajectories would benefit prevention efforts.",nonCancer
2025,"Expressions of CD8+TILs, PD-L1 and Foxp3+TILs in stage I NSCLC guiding adjuvant chemotherapy decisions.","Currently, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with high risk stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, identifying high risk patients remains a challenge. This study aims to identify the patient cohorts more likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy based on the tumor micro-immune environment.|CD8+TILs significantly associated with disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survial (OS) (p=0.002; 0.040). Patients with high risk factors may also predict shorter DFS (P=0.056). When compared together, patients with high-CD8+TILs showed better DFS than patients with low-CD8+TILs, no matter their risk factors status. There's no correlation between PD-L1 expressions and survival. PD-L1 was highly expressed in men, squamous and well differentiated carcinoma. In addition, Foxp3+TILs alone didn't show any prognostic effects, but low-Foxp3/high-CD8+TILs were associated with prolonged DFS (p=0.031).|A total of 126 patients with surgically resected stage I NSCLC were included to perform immunohistochemistry of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), programmed death ligand-1(PD-L1) and forkhead box P3 (Foxp3)+TILs.|CD8+TILs are effective prognostic predictors.

1828,Measuring extent of surface contamination produced by the handling of antineoplastic drugs in low- to middle-income country oncology health care settings.,"Antineoplastic drugs are known to cause detrimental effects to health care workers who are exposed through work tasks. Environmental monitoring studies are an excellent approach to measure the extent of surface contamination produced by the handling of antineoplastic drugs in the workplace and to assess the potential for occupational exposures in oncology health care settings. The main aim of the study was to establish the extent of surface contamination produced by the handling of antineoplastic drugs in a limited-resource oncology health care facility in Colombia by conducting an environmental monitoring study using affordable analytical instrumentation. Contamination with antineoplastic drugs was widespread in the health care facility under evaluation, which could result in health care worker exposure to antineoplastic drugs. A comprehensive review of current safety guidelines and protocols including assessment of adherence in the health care facility should be done.",nonCancer
54,The BRAF(V600E) mutation in papillary thyroid microcarcinoma: does the mutation have an impact on clinical outcome?,"An activating mutation in the gene BRAF has been correlated with poorer prognosis and more aggressive clinical course in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). We therefore hypothesized that the good prognosis, high 5-year disease-free rate and high survival rate of patients with less aggressive papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (pT1aNo-x) would be associated with a lower incidence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation. To evaluate the frequency of the activating mutation BRAF(V600E) in low-risk papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (pT1aNo-x at the moment of diagnosis) and the association of the mutation with the clinical outcome in a retrospective analysis. BRAF(V600E) was characterized in 113 PTC patients diagnosed with pT1aNo-x (one PTC focus with a diameter <1 cm, without lymph node or distant metastases according to IUCC/AJCC TNM staging system 2010). Genotyping was performed on DNA extracted from thyroid tumour tissue using direct capillary sequencing, and allele-specific amplification PCR was used to resolve equivocal results. Retrospective analysis of the clinical course of PTC was then correlated with BRAF status in the primary tumour tissue. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was detected in 78 of the 113 pT1aNo-x patients (69·0%). We observed no persistence, locoregional recurrence, lymph node or distant metastases or deaths in the study group during the 12-year study (January 2001 to December 2012). The presence of the activating BRAF(V) (600E) mutation in a significant percentage of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma indicates that further analyses are required to verify its usefulness as a predictor of clinical outcome in PTC. In this study, there was no correlation between BRAF-positive primary focus of papillary microcarcinoma and more aggressive or recurrent disease.",cancer
1749,Effect of Water on Survival and Development of Diapausing Eggs of Apolygus lucorum (Hemiptera: Miridae).,"The green mirid bug Apolygus lucorum is a regional pest of multiple crops in northern China, and the survival and development of diapausing eggs during winter plays an important role in the population dynamics of this species. The effect of water on the survival and development of A. lucorum eggs was investigated using laboratory-induced diapause. Diapausing eggs were exposed to various humidity regimes under three conditions: (1) termination of diapause with exposure to warm long-day (WLD) conditions (i.e., 26 ± 1°C and 75 ± 5% relative humidity (RH) under a photoperiod of 16 hours light and 8 hours dark), (2) termination of diapause by chilling at 4°C, or (3) during the post-diapause stage, i.e., from transfer to WLD conditions after chilling, until the hatching of nymphs. The results indicate that water availability is crucial for the post-diapause resumption of development of A. lucorum. However, exposure to excessive moisture was detrimental, as indicated by a decrease in diapause termination rate and a prolonged pre-hatching period of diapausing eggs, compared to limited moisture conditions. This implies that both too dry and too humid environmental conditions would suppress survival and postpone hatching of overwintered A. lucorum eggs, and might explain why this pest has not caused severe damage in either southern or western China where the respective climates are very humid or dry.",nonCancer
233,The associations between RAS mutations and clinical characteristics in follicular thyroid tumors: new insights from a single center and a large patient cohort.,"Many studies on thyroid follicular tumors have reported the presence of somatic mutations to three forms of RAS: HRAS, KRAS, and NRAS. However, the frequency and clinical significance of these RAS mutations remain unclear, in large part due to the different methodologies being used for mutation analysis and the limited number of cases featured in studies. To clarify the significance of RAS mutations, we examined a large number of follicular adenomas and carcinomas obtained from a single institute using established methods for the analysis of RAS. Tumor samples from 40 follicular adenoma and 58 follicular carcinoma patients treated at the Kanagawa Cancer Center Hospital were analyzed. The three RAS mutations at codons 12 and 61 were assessed with a polymerase chain reaction-based loop-hybrid mobility shift assay followed by confirmation with direct sequencing. The relationships between mutation status and clinicopathological features at the time of the initial operation and the prognosis of the patients were also analyzed. Twelve out of 40 (30%) adenomas harbored RAS mutations. In contrast, 33 out of 58 (57%) follicular carcinomas harbored RAS mutations, and the mutation was predominantly found in the NRAS codon 61 (22/33, 67%, p<0.01). The rate of gene mutations was significantly higher in the carcinomas than in the adenomas (p<0.01). The NRAS codon 61 mutation in follicular carcinomas was positively associated with distant metastases through the entire clinical course of the patients (p<0.05), and RAS mutations were associated with poor overall patient survival (p<0.05). We investigated the frequency of RAS mutations in follicular thyroid tumors from a large number of cases obtained from a single institute. The predominance of NRAS codon 61 mutations as a feature of carcinomas indicates that the diagnosis of adenoma alongside the presence of this mutation should be made cautiously. Our study raises the possibility that follicular adenomas with the RAS mutations have an inherent malignant potential; however, the clinical significance of this finding should be further investigated in more patients and over a longer follow-up period.",cancer
865,Overcoming mTOR resistance mutations with a new-generation mTOR inhibitor.,"Precision medicines exert selective pressure on tumour cells that leads to the preferential growth of resistant subpopulations, necessitating the development of next-generation therapies to treat the evolving cancer. The PIK3CA-AKT-mTOR pathway is one of the most commonly activated pathways in human cancers, which has led to the development of small-molecule inhibitors that target various nodes in the pathway. Among these agents, first-generation mTOR inhibitors (rapalogs) have caused responses in 'N-of-1' cases, and second-generation mTOR kinase inhibitors (TORKi) are currently in clinical trials. Here we sought to delineate the likely resistance mechanisms to existing mTOR inhibitors in human cell lines, as a guide for next-generation therapies. The mechanism of resistance to the TORKi was unusual in that intrinsic kinase activity of mTOR was increased, rather than a direct active-site mutation interfering with drug binding. Indeed, identical drug-resistant mutations have been also identified in drug-naive patients, suggesting that tumours with activating MTOR mutations will be intrinsically resistant to second-generation mTOR inhibitors. We report the development of a new class of mTOR inhibitors that overcomes resistance to existing first- and second-generation inhibitors. The third-generation mTOR inhibitor exploits the unique juxtaposition of two drug-binding pockets to create a bivalent interaction that allows inhibition of these resistant mutants.",cancer
1234,GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and disease progression in patients with malignant melanoma.,"Once metastasized, despite a variety of therapeutic options, the prognosis of patients with malignant melanoma (MM) is still poor. Therefore, the search for reliable markers to identify patients with high risk of disease progression is of high clinical importance. We have recently shown that TT genotypes of the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T393C in the gene GNAS1 are significantly associated with better outcome in a variety of carcinomas. - In the present study we assessed whether the T393C SNP is also related to the clinical course in MM. 328 patients with MM were retrospectively genotyped and genotypes were correlated with clinical outcome. - While the allele frequency in the MM group (fC 0.52) did not significantly differ from that of healthy blood donors, the T393C SNP was associated with tumor progression of MM. Carriers of the C-allele showed a significantly more severe tumor progression as estimated from the time period to develop metastasis (HR 2.2, 95% CI 1.1-3.2, p = 0.017). Proportions of 5-year metastasis-free intervals were 87.1% for TT genotypes and 66.0% for C-allele carriers. Moreover, multivariable Cox regression analysis including tumor stage and melanoma subtype proved the T393C polymorphism to be an independent factor for metastasis (p = 0.012). - In summary, the GNAS1 T393C SNP represents a genetic host factor for predicting tumor progression also in patients with MM; genotyping of this SNP may contribute to better define patients who could benefit from an early individualized therapy.",cancer
464,The EMT activator ZEB1 promotes tumor growth and determines differential response to chemotherapy in mantle cell lymphoma.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a B-cell malignancy characterized by a poor response to treatment and prognosis. Constitutive activation of different signaling pathways in subsets of MCLs, through genetic and/or nongenetic alterations, endows tumor cells with enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The canonical Wnt pathway (β-catenin/TCF-LEF), implicated in the pathogenesis of numerous cancers, is constitutively active in half of MCLs. Here, we show that ZEB1, a transcription factor better known for promoting metastasis in carcinomas, is expressed in primary MCLs with active Wnt signaling. ZEB1 expression in MCL cells depends on Wnt, being downregulated by β-catenin knockdown or blocking of Wnt signaling by salinomycin. Knockdown of ZEB1 reduces in vitro cell viability and proliferation in MCL cells, and, importantly, tumor growth in mouse xenograft models. ZEB1 activates proliferation-associated (HMGB2, UHRF1, CENPF, MYC, MKI67, and CCND1) and anti-apoptotic (MCL1, BCL2, and BIRC5) genes and inhibits pro-apoptotic ones (TP53, BBC3, PMAIP1, and BAX). We show that ZEB1 expression in MCL cells determines differential resistance to chemotherapy drugs and regulates transporters involved in drug influx/efflux. Downregulation of ZEB1 by salinomycin increases the sensitivity of MCL cells to the cytotoxic effect of doxorubicin, cytarabine and gemcitabine. Lastly, salinomycin and doxorubicin display a synergistic effect in established and primary MCL cells. These results identify ZEB1 in MCL where it promotes cell proliferation, enhanced tumor growth and a differential response to chemotherapy drugs. ZEB1 could thus potentially become a predictive biomarker and therapeutic target in this lymphoma.",cancer

The effects of OT have been studied in young and adult subjects (either animals or humans), while the complete lifespan trajectories of OT system development and activity have been far less investigated. In this (mini) review, we will primarily focus on three temporal distinct periods of life - early postnatal period, puberty/adolescence and elderly. We selected the neonatal period to discuss the role of OT in the switch of GABA action from excitation to inhibition in the first days after birth (in rodents), with potential implications in neurodevelopmental disorders. In the puberty/adolescence period, we consider of particular relevance the OT impact on drug consumption, stress and aggression. Finally, OT could potentially contribute to maintain social capacities of aged people and to ameliorate socially-emotional deficits and symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases.

1618,Modification of the association between smoking status and severity of coronary stenosis by vitamin D in patients suspected of coronary heart disease.,"Given both smoking and vitamin D are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) via inflammation and smoking may interfere with the local antiinflammatory effects of vitamin D. We hypothesized that the relationship between smoking and severity of CHD may be modified by vitamin D.A cross-sectional study was conducted. 25-OH vitamin D values were determined in 348 consecutive patients (mean age 62.4 ± 10.5 years; 56.3% male) undergoing coronary angiography at the Heart Center of Chaoyang Hospital affiliated to Capital Medical University between the period of September 2014 and May 2015. We categorized the patients into 2 groups based on 25-OH vitamin D levels, that is, severe hypovitaminosis D (25-OH vitamin D < 10 ng/mL) and higher vitamin D (25-OH vitamin D > =  10 ng/mL). Multivariable logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) of severe coronary stenosis or higher Gensini score across three smoking status, that is, never smokers, former smokers, and current smokers in severe hypovitaminosis D and higher vitamin D groups, respectively.Of these patients, we identified 212 (60.9%) cases of severe CHD and 161 (46.3%) cases of severe hypovitaminosis D. Multivariable logistic regression model showed the ORs of severe CHD were 1.94 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.47, 7.98) for former smokers and 2.62 (95% CI: 0.83, 8.24) for current smokers, compared with never smokers in group with severe hypovitaminosis D (P-trend = 0.005). In contrast, smoking was not found to be significantly associated with severe CHD in group with higher 25-OH vitamin D (P-trend = 0.115). We found a significant interaction between smoking status and vitamin D on presence of severe CHD (P-interaction = 0.015). In terms of Gensini score as a dependent variable, similar results were identified.Our finding indicated the association between smoking and severity of CHD appeared to be substantially stronger among patients with severe hypovitaminosis D as compared with those with higher vitamin D levels. This suggests vitamin D sufficiency may have a protective effect against the damaging effects of smoking on coronary artery. Future cohort studies are warranted to confirm this finding.",nonCancer
370,Analysis of the tyrosine kinome in melanoma reveals recurrent mutations in ERBB4.,"Tyrosine phosphorylation is important in signaling pathways underlying tumorigenesis. We performed a mutational analysis of the protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) gene family in cutaneous metastatic melanoma. We identified 30 somatic mutations affecting the kinase domains of 19 PTKs and subsequently evaluated the entire coding regions of the genes encoding these 19 PTKs for somatic mutations in 79 melanoma samples. We found ERBB4 mutations in 19% of individuals with melanoma and found mutations in two other kinases (FLT1 and PTK2B) in 10% of individuals with melanomas. We examined seven missense mutations in the most commonly altered PTK gene, ERBB4, and found that they resulted in increased kinase activity and transformation ability. Melanoma cells expressing mutant ERBB4 had reduced cell growth after shRNA-mediated knockdown of ERBB4 or treatment with the ERBB inhibitor lapatinib. These studies could lead to personalized therapeutics specifically targeting the kinases that are mutationally altered in individual melanomas.",cancer

IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were found in four (2.0%) and ten (5.0%) AML and in two (2.4%) and three (3.6%) MDS cases, but not in other patients. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations were heterozygous and mutually exclusive. IDH1/2 mutations were significantly more frequently observed in cytogenetically normal AML or MDS compared to those without mutations. There was no difference in overall survival of both AML and MDS patients with or without IDH1/2 mutations (P = 0.177 and 0.407, respectively). In conclusion, IDH1/2 mutations are recurrent but rare molecular aberrations in Chinese AML and MDS.",cancer
43,Regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Regorafenib is an oral multikinase inhibitor that blocks the activity of protein kinases involved in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis (VEGFR1, 2, 3; angiopoietin-1 receptor), oncogenesis (stem cell growth factor receptor; RET; BRAF including BRAFV600E), and tumor microenvironment (PDGFR-β and FGFR). Based on data from the Phase III CORRECT study, regorafenib stands as a further option for patient affected by metastatic colorectal cancer who have exhausted previous available therapies. Its multi-targeted effect might explain activity in advanced lines of treatment, when cancer cells have been heavily challenged with previous lines of therapy and potentially developed multiple mechanisms of resistance, but also makes difficult to identify predictive biomarkers. In this article we examine preclinical as well as clinical data of regorafenib in the therapy of metastatic colorectal cancer, challenges for potential markers of efficacy and its role in the treatment algorithm.",cancer
272,Mutations and deletions of the TP53 gene predict nonresponse to treatment and poor outcome in first relapse of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"In the clinical management of children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), treatment resistance remains a major challenge. Alterations of the TP53 gene are frequently associated with resistance to chemotherapy, but their significance in relapsed childhood ALL has remained controversial because of small studies. Therefore, we systematically studied 265 first-relapse patients enrolled in the German Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Relapse Berlin-Frankfurt-Mü nster 2002 (ALL-REZ BFM 2002) trial for sequence and copy number alterations of the TP53 gene by using direct sequencing and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We observed copy number and sequence alterations of TP53 in 12.4% (27 of 218) of patients with B-cell precursor ALL and 6.4% (three of 47) of patients with T-cell ALL relapse. Backtracking to initial ALL in 23 matched samples revealed that 54% of all TP53 alterations were gained at relapse. Within B-cell precursor ALL, TP53 alterations were consistently associated with nonresponse to chemotherapy (P < .001) and poor event-free survival (P < .001) and overall survival rates (P = .002). TP53 alterations also had a significant impact on survival within intermediate-risk (S2) and high-risk (S3/S4) relapse patients (P = .007 and P = .019, respectively). This prognostic significance of TP53 alterations was confirmed in multivariate analysis. Besides their clinical impact, TP53 alterations were associated with a higher fraction of leukemic cells in S/G(2)-M phase of the cell cycle at relapse diagnosis. Alterations of the TP53 gene are of particular importance in the relapse stage of childhood ALL, in which they independently predict high risk of treatment failure in a significant number of patients. Therefore, they will aid in future risk assessment of children with ALL relapse.",cancer
1102,Large-scale analysis of PDGFRA mutations in melanomas and evaluation of their sensitivity to tyrosine kinase inhibitors imatinib and crenolanib.,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRA) is a target for tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-based targeted therapy. Dysregulation of PDGFRA has been reported in many cancers. However, PDGFRA mutations in melanomas have not been well studied. We analyzed the genetic mutations of PDGFRA in Chinese patients with melanoma and determined the inhibitory potency of TKIs, such as imatinib and crenolanib, on mutant PDGFRA. Of note, 351 melanoma tissue samples were examined for genetic mutations in exons 12, 14, and 18 of PDGFRA. Activities of mutations in response to imatinib and crenolanib were analyzed by Western blotting of tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFRA and cell proliferation assays. PDGFRA mutations were observed in 4.6% (16 of 351) of melanomas, and these mutations were mainly detected in acral and mucosal melanomas. PDGFRA mutations seem to be mutually exclusive with KIT mutations, but may coexist with BRAF and NRAS mutations. The genetic mutations of PDGFRA were unrelated to the age, thickness, and ulceration status of primary melanomas. Thirteen mutations were not reported before, and five (P577S, V658A, R841K, H845Y, and G853D) of them resulted in strong autophosphorylation of PDGFRA. Crenolanib showed higher potency than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of PDGFRA. Except that V658A mutation was imatinib-resistant, all the other mutations were sensitive to both imatinib and crenolanib. PDGFRA mutations are detected in a small population of melanoma patients. Our study suggests that patients with melanoma harboring certain PDGFRA mutations may benefit from imatinib and crenolanib treatment.",cancer

Two authors selected studies according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, assessed studies using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale case control study (NOS), and calculated the combined effect size using STATA software, version 12.0.|This meta-analysis included 18 studies, containing 2453 healthy participants and 2987 patients with chronic periodontitis (CP) and 462 patients with aggressive periodontitis (AP). There was a significance between TLR4C>G (rs7873784) allele and CP in Asian, and its recessive model was also significant (for C vs G: odds ratio [OR] = 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.54-0.95, I = 0%; for CC + CG vs GG: OR = 0.66, 95% CI = 0.49-0.89, I = 0%). However, we did not detect any significant relevance between other TLR4 polymorphism and periodontitis susceptibility in overall and subgroup analyses. The sensitive analysis showed that dropping any single studies did not affect the pooled-analysis results. Publication bias was not detected.|The meta-analysis found association between TLR4C>G (rs7873784) allele and CP in Asian and it may passed on to offsprings in the form of recessiveness.

1711,Pancreaticoduodenectomy for nonampullary duodenal lesions: indications and results.,"Pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) is a complex procedure, associated with a definite risk of mortality and 30-50% risk of complications. For nonampullary duodenal lesions, PD can carry a higher morbidity as they are more commonly associated with a soft pancreas and narrow-calibre main pancreatic ducts. It is therefore paramount that the risks and benefits of surgery are considered carefully in this group of patients. A preoperative histological diagnosis for duodenal lesions is normally achieved by endoscopic biopsy. In this study, we aim to assess the outcome of PD in patients with nonampullary duodenal lesions and correlate the preoperative endoscopic histology work-up with the definitive postoperative pathology.|We reviewed a prospectively collected PD database from January 2007 to December 2013. Demographic and clinical data were included. Preoperative endoscopic histology was compared with final specimen histology to assess concordance.|Forty patients (55% women, mean age 69.4 years, range 45-83 years) underwent PD for duodenal lesions over a 7-year time period. The most common presenting symptom was epigastric pain (32.5%), followed by anaemia (20%). Overall, the complication rate was 55%, with the most frequent adverse event being pancreatic fistula in 13/40 (32.5%). The perioperative mortality was 2/40 (5%). Duodenal adenocarcinoma (65%) was the most common postoperative histological diagnosis. The mean tumour size was 36 mm (range 5-103 mm) and a median of 13 nodes were harvested. The median length of stay was 15 days (range 7-66 days). Overall, 12/40 patients (30%) had a preoperative diagnosis of high-grade dysplasia. The postoperative specimen in this subgroup of patients was reviewed carefully and only 3/12 (25%) patients had high-grade dysplasia in the resection specimen. In the remaining patients, 3/12 (25%) had adenocarcinoma in the resection specimen and 6/12 patients (50%) had low-grade dysplasia.|PD carries a high mortality and morbidity, especially for duodenal lesions. We recommend a careful endoscopic review after the index case with a high-definition optical evaluation of duodenal lesions. This, in addition to an experienced histological assessment of the index biopsy material, forms an essential prerequisite in aiding the multidisciplinary team in the decision-making process with respect to triage of these lesions to conservative management, surveillance, endoscopic resection or finally surgical resection.",nonCancer
1277,Parallel steady state studies on a milliliter scale accelerate fed-batch bioprocess design for recombinant protein production with Escherichia coli.,"In general, fed-batch processes are applied for recombinant protein production with Escherichia coli (E. coli). However, state of the art methods for identifying suitable reaction conditions suffer from severe drawbacks, i.e. direct transfer of process information from parallel batch studies is often defective and sequential fed-batch studies are time-consuming and cost-intensive. In this study, continuously operated stirred-tank reactors on a milliliter scale were applied to identify suitable reaction conditions for fed-batch processes. Isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction strategies were varied in parallel-operated stirred-tank bioreactors to study the effects on the continuous production of the recombinant protein photoactivatable mCherry (PAmCherry) with E. coli. Best-performing induction strategies were transferred from the continuous processes on a milliliter scale to liter scale fed-batch processes. Inducing recombinant protein expression by dynamically increasing the IPTG concentration to 100 µM lead to an increase in the product concentration of 21% (8.4 g L(-1) ) compared to an implemented high-performance production process with the most frequently applied induction strategy by a single addition of 1000 µM IPGT. Thus, identifying feasible reaction conditions for fed-batch processes in parallel continuous studies on a milliliter scale was shown to be a powerful, novel method to accelerate bioprocess design in a cost-reducing manner.

We found that gene expression of both ABCB1/MDR1 (ABCB1) and ABCC10 was higher in PC-6/TAX1-1 cells than in PC-6 cells. The expression levels of ABCC10 showed a significant inverse correlation with paclitaxel sensitivity (r = 0.574; P < 0.05) in 17 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells unlike the expression levels of ABCB1. Pretreatment with the ABCC10 inhibitor sulfinpyrazone altered the sensitivity to paclitaxel in ABCC10-expressing NSCLC cells, concomitant with increased intracellular paclitaxel accumulation. These findings suggest that expression of the ABCC10 gene is induced by paclitaxel and that ABCC10 confers paclitaxel resistance by enhancing the efflux for paclitaxel. To confirm this hypothesis, we tested the effect on paclitaxel cytotoxicity of decreasing the expression of ABCC10 by small interfering RNA and found that this enhanced paclitaxel cytotoxicity in NCI-H23 cells concomitant with increased intracellular paclitaxel accumulation. These data indicate that ABCC10 may be one of the biomarkers for paclitaxel resistance in NSCLC.",cancer
2149,Locus coeruleus and dopaminergic consolidation of everyday memory.,"The retention of episodic-like memory is enhanced, in humans and animals, when something novel happens shortly before or after encoding. Using an everyday memory task in mice, we sought the neurons mediating this dopamine-dependent novelty effect, previously thought to originate exclusively from the tyrosine-hydroxylase-expressing (TH(+)) neurons in the ventral tegmental area. Here we report that neuronal firing in the locus coeruleus is especially sensitive to environmental novelty, locus coeruleus TH(+) neurons project more profusely than ventral tegmental area TH(+) neurons to the hippocampus, optogenetic activation of locus coeruleus TH(+) neurons mimics the novelty effect, and this novelty-associated memory enhancement is unaffected by ventral tegmental area inactivation. Surprisingly, two effects of locus coeruleus TH(+) photoactivation are sensitive to hippocampal D1/D5 receptor blockade and resistant to adrenoceptor blockade: memory enhancement and long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission in CA1 ex vivo. Thus, locus coeruleus TH(+) neurons can mediate post-encoding memory enhancement in a manner consistent with possible co-release of dopamine in the hippocampus.",nonCancer
479,PIK3CA mutation is associated with poor survival among patients with metastatic colorectal cancer following anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy: a meta-analysis.,"PIK3CA mutation appears to predict a lack of response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (mAb) treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). However, the predictive value of PIK3CA mutations for survival remains inconclusive. Here, we pooled the data from published studies to estimate the association between PIK3CA mutation and survival outcomes in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs. Studies investigating the association of PIK3CA mutations with clinical survival outcomes of mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs were systematically identified. The overall hazard ratio (HR) was estimated by using fixed effect model or random effect model according to heterogeneity between trails. Eight studies that reported survival outcome in 839 mCRC patients were included. In unselected patients, we found that PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with poorer PFS [8 studies, 839 patients; HR = 1.53; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.28-1.84; P < 0.001] and OS (5 studies; 587 patients; HR = 1.28; 95 % CI 1.05-1.56; P = 0.015). With increased predictive power in KRAS wild-type patients (3 studies; 275 patients), the overall HR for PFS was 2.44 (95 % CI 1.33-4.48; P = 0.004) and was statistically significant. We also observed a worse OS in KRAS wild-type patients with PIK3CA mutations (2 studies; 163 patients; HR = 1.37; 95 % CI 0.80-2.35; P = 0.258), although the result was not statistically significant due to small sample size. PIK3CA mutation is a promising predictive biomarker for poor survival in mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR mAbs, particularly in KRAS wild-type patients.",cancer
350,Elevated expression of RIT1 correlates with poor prognosis in endometrial cancer.,"RIT1, (Ras-like without CAAX1), the founding member of a novel branch of the Ras subfamily, mediates a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell proliferation, survival, and differentiation, and it may play crucial oncogenic role in human cancer. The purpose of the current study was to characterize the expression pattern of RIT1 and assess the clinical significance of RIT1 expression in endometrial cancer patients. The mRNA and protein expression of RIT1 was significantly overexpressed in 7 endometrial cancer cell lines by qPCR and Western blot, respectively. In addition, RIT1 mRNA expression was elevated in 36 freshly frozen endometrial cancer tissues compared to 21 non-cancerous endometrial tissue samples. Similar results were observed by analyzing GEO datasets. Immunohistochemistry was used to examine the protein expression of RIT1 in two tissue microarrays containing 257 cases of tumor and 31 non-tumor tissues, which showed that elevated expression of RIT1 was significantly correlated with pathological type, clinical stage, grade and vascular invasion. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that RIT1 expression was associated with overall survival of endometrial cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that RIT1 expression was one of the independent prognostic factors for endometrial cancer patients. Furthermore, RIT1 combined with other clinicopathological risk factors was a more significant model in ROC curve comparison. In conclusion, elevated expression of RIT1 may contribute to the progression of endometrial cancer and thus may serve as a novel prognostic marker and a promising molecular target for the treatment of endometrial cancer.",cancer

According to propensity score matched 1:2 on age, gender, AS duration, Charlson comorbidity index, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, 236 and 472 patients were included in the case (AS with CAD) and control (AS without CAD) groups, respectively. We used the WHO defined daily dose (DDD) as a tool to assess the dosage of sulfasalazine and celecoxib exposure. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the risk of CAD associated with use of sulfasalazine and celecoxib.Among 4112 AS patients, 8.4% (346/4112) developed CAD. CAD in AS patients were positively associated with age of 35 to 65, Charlson comorbidities index (CCI), hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. There was no gender difference between case and control groups. After adjustment for age, gender, CCI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, sulfasalazine users with an average daily dose ≥ 0.5 DDD (0.5 gm/day) had negative association with CAD events as compared to sulfasalazine nonusers (OR 0.63; 95% CI, 0.40-0.99, P < 0.05). NSAIDs, including celecoxib, etoricoxib, but no naproxen and diclofenac were negatively associated with CAD. Celecoxib users, with an average daily dose > 1.5 DDD, were negatively associated with CAD events, compared to celecoxib nonusers (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.13-0.89; P < 0.05).In this 10-year population-based case-control study, 8.4% of AS patients developed CAD.

575,Activity of ponatinib against clinically-relevant AC220-resistant kinase domain mutants of FLT3-ITD.,"Secondary point mutations in the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinase domain (KD) are common causes of acquired clinical resistance to the FLT3 inhibitors AC220 (quizartinib) and sorafenib. Ponatinib (AP24534) is a multikinase inhibitor with in vitro and clinical activity in tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia, irrespective of BCR-ABL KD mutation. Ponatinib has demonstrated early clinical efficacy in chemotherapy-resistant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3. We assessed the in vitro activity of ponatinib against clinically relevant FLT3-ITD mutant isoforms that confer resistance to AC220 or sorafenib. Substitution of the FLT3 ""gatekeeper"" phenylalanine with leucine (F691L) conferred mild resistance to ponatinib, but substitutions at the FLT3 activation loop (AL) residue D835 conferred a high degree of resistance. Saturation mutagenesis of FLT3-ITD exclusively identified FLT3 AL mutations at positions D835, D839, and Y842. The switch control inhibitor DCC-2036 was similarly inactive against FLT3 AL mutations. On the basis of its in vitro activity against FLT3 TKI-resistant F691 substitutions, further clinical evaluation of ponatinib in TKI-naïve and select TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD+ AML patients is warranted. Alternative strategies will be required for patients with TKI-resistant FLT3-ITD D835 mutations.",cancer
2084,Clostridium difficile Infection in Production Animals and Avian Species: A Review.,"Clostridium difficile is the leading cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea and colitis in hospitalized humans. Recently, C. difficile infection (CDI) has been increasingly recognized as a cause of neonatal enteritis in food animals such as pigs, resulting in stunted growth, delays in weaning, and mortality, as well as colitis in large birds such as ostriches. C. difficile is a strictly anaerobic spore-forming bacterium, which produces two toxins A (TcdA) and B (TcdB) as its main virulence factors. The majority of strains isolated from animals produce an additional binary toxin (C. difficile transferase) that is associated with increased virulence. C. difficile is ubiquitous in the environment and has a wide host range. This review summarizes the epidemiology, clinical presentations, risk factors, and laboratory diagnosis of CDI in animals. Increased awareness by veterinarians and animal owners of the significance of clinical disease caused by C. difficile in livestock and avians is needed. Finally, this review provides an overview on methods for controlling environmental contamination and potential therapeutics available.",nonCancer
2439,Expression of microRNA-30a-5p in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines.,"The present study aimed to explore the expression of microRNA (miRNA or miR) in drug-resistant and drug-sensitive ovarian cancer cell lines, and to seek the potential therapeutic target of ovarian cancer drug-resistant mechanism in order to improve drug resistance by altering miRNA levels. The drug-resistant characteristics of SKOV3/DDP, SKOV3, COC1/DDP and COC1 cell lines were studied. The miRNAs that were differentially expressed between cisplatin-resistant cells and its parental cells in ovarian cancer were screened with a miRNA chip. The effect of miRNAs was detected, and their drug-resistant mechanism was investigated by transfection and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide methods. Among the expression screening of miRNAs, 41 mRNAs, including Homo sapiens (hsa)-miR-30a-5p and hsa-miR-34c-5p, were highly expressed in the drug-resistant cells, whereas 44 miRNAs, including hsa-miR-96-5p and hsa-miR-200c-3p, were lowly expressed. The expression levels of hsa-miR-30a-5p in two types of ovarian cancer chemotherapy-resistant cell lines were significantly higher than those in chemotherapy-sensitive cell lines, which was associated with ovarian cancer chemotherapy resistance. In conclusion, high expression of miRNA-30a-5p was able to promote cell growth and colony forming ability, and enhance cell migration and invasion. Thus, miRNA-30a-5p is expected to become a meaningful novel target for ovarian cancer resistant treatment.",nonCancer
1886,Medium-dose estrogen ameliorates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in ovariectomized mice.,"Estrogen is a neuro-protective hormone in various central nervous system (CNS) disorders. The present study evaluated the role of estrogen during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) at doses selected to mimic any suppressive potential from the hormone during pregnancy. Here, mice were ovariectomized and then 2 weeks later treated with MOG antigen to induce EAE. Concurrently, mice then received (subcutaneously) an implanted pellet to deliver varying estrogen amounts over a 21-day period. Clinical scores and other parameters were monitored daily for the 21 days. At the end of the period, brain/spinal cord histology was performed to measure lymphocyte infiltration; T-cell profiles were determined through ELISA, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Transcription factor expression levels in the CNS were assessed using real-time PCR; T-cell differentiation was evaluated via flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that estrogen inhibited development of EAE. Histological studies revealed limited leukocyte infiltration into the CNS. High and medium dose of estrogen increased TH2 and Treg cell production of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, but concurrently resulted in a significant reduction in production of interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17, and IL-6. Flow cytometry revealed there were also significant decreases in the percentages of TH1 and TH17 cells, as well as significant increase in percentages of Treg and TH2 cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. Real-time PCR results indicated that high- and medium-dose estrogen treatments reduced T-bet and ROR-γt factor expression, but enhanced Foxp3 and GATA3 expression. Collectively, these results demonstrated that a medium dose of estrogen - similar to a pregnancy level of estrogen - could potentially reduce the incidence and severity of autoimmune EAE and possibly other autoimmune pathologies.",nonCancer

1258,NY-ESO-1-specific TCR-engineered T cells mediate sustained antigen-specific antitumor effects in myeloma.,"Despite recent therapeutic advances, multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely incurable. Here we report results of a phase I/II trial to evaluate the safety and activity of autologous T cells engineered to express an affinity-enhanced T cell receptor (TCR) recognizing a naturally processed peptide shared by the cancer-testis antigens NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1. Twenty patients with antigen-positive MM received an average 2.4 × 10(9) engineered T cells 2 d after autologous stem cell transplant. Infusions were well tolerated without clinically apparent cytokine-release syndrome, despite high IL-6 levels. Engineered T cells expanded, persisted, trafficked to marrow and exhibited a cytotoxic phenotype. Persistence of engineered T cells in blood was inversely associated with NY-ESO-1 levels in the marrow. Disease progression was associated with loss of T cell persistence or antigen escape, in accordance with the expected mechanism of action of the transferred T cells. Encouraging clinical responses were observed in 16 of 20 patients (80%) with advanced disease, with a median progression-free survival of 19.1 months. NY-ESO-1-LAGE-1 TCR-engineered T cells were safe, trafficked to marrow and showed extended persistence that correlated with clinical activity against antigen-positive myeloma.",cancer
1083,Association of GSTT1 non-null and NAT1 slow/rapid genotypes with von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor gene transversions in sporadic renal cell carcinoma.,"The von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumour suppressor gene is commonly mutated in renal cell carcinoma of clear cell type (CCRCC). We investigated the possible relationship between VHL mutations in sporadic CCRCC and polymorphism of genes encoding enzymes involved in carcinogen metabolism: two cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYP1A1 and CYP2D6), one NAD[P]H:quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), three glutathione S-transferases (GSTM1, GSTT1 and GSTP1) and two arylamine N-acetyltransferases (NAT1 and NAT2). We analysed DNA from tumour and nontumoural kidney tissue from 195 CCRCC patients. Single VHL mutations were identified in 88 patients and double mutations were present in two patients. Nine of 18 transversions were GC to TA, four were AT to TA, four were GC to CG and one was AT to CG. Ten of 19 transitions were GC to AT and nine were AT to GC. We also identified 53 frameshifts and two GC to AT at CpG. An excess of transversions was observed in a subset of patients with active GSTT1 [GSTT1 (+) genotype] and probably defective NAT1 (NAT1 S/R variant genotype). All 18 transversions were in GSTT1 (+) patients, whereas only 76% of transitions (P = 0.05) and 81% of the other mutations (P = 0.06) occurred in this genotype. We found that 28% of the transversions were in the NAT1 S/R genotype versus 12% of the transitions (P = 0.40) and 4% of the other mutations (P = 0.01). This suggests that pharmacogenetic polymorphisms may be associated with the type of acquired VHL mutation, which may modulate CCRCC development.",cancer

215,Prevalence and prognostic implications of CEBPA mutations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML): a report from the Children's Oncology Group.,"CEBPA mutations have been associated with improved outcome in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). We evaluated the prevalence and prognostic significance of CEBPA mutations in 847 children with AML treated on 3 consecutive pediatric trials. Two types of CEBPA mutations-N-terminal truncating mutations and in-frame bZip-domain mutations-were detected in 38 (4.5%) of 847 patients tested; 31 (82%) of 38 patients with mutations harbored both mutation types. Mutation status was correlated with laboratory and clinical characteristics and clinical outcome. CEBPA mutations were significantly more common in older patients, patients with FAB M1 or M2, and patients with normal karyotype. Mutations did not occur in patients with either favorable or unfavorable cytogenetics. Actuarial event-free survival at 5 years was 70% versus 38% (P = .015) with a cumulative incidence of relapse from complete remission of 13% versus 44% (P = .007) for those with and without CEBPA mutations. The presence of CEBPA mutations was an independent prognostic factor for improved outcome (HR = 0.24, P = .047). As CEBPA mutations are associated with lower relapse rate and improved survival, CEBPA mutation analysis needs to be incorporated into initial screening for risk identification and therapy allocation at diagnosis.",cancer

The demographics, clinical characteristics, medication use, results of investigations, and medical and surgical management for patients with UC were evaluated. Evaluation included sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy performed in compliance with the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy practice guidelines. Patient ethnicities were categorized into seven groups: Thai, Oriental, South Asian (SA), Middle Eastern (ME), Caucasian, African, and Hispanic. UC pathological severity was classified into inactive, mild, moderate, and severe. Associations between categorical variables were analyzed using the χ(2) or Fischer's exact test. Associations between categorical and interval variables were analyzed using Student's t-test and/or analysis of covariance.|UC was diagnosed in 371 of the 268465 patients: male 56.33%; ME 42%, Caucasian 23%, and Thai 19%. Annual incidence of UC was 82 cases per 100000 with wide ethnic variation, ranging from 29 to 206 cases per 100000 in Oriental and ME patients, respectively. Of the patients with UC, 16.71% had severe UC with highest incidence among the patients from ME (20.39%) and lowest among the Caucasian population (11.90%). ME had highest proportion of pancolitis (52.90%), followed by Caucasian (45.35%) and Asian (34.40%). Only 20.93% of Caucasian patients received steroid, compared with 26.40% and 27.10% of Asian and Middle Eastern, respectively (P = 0.732). Overall, 13.72% of UC patients did not respond to steroid therapy, with non-significantly higher proportions of non-responders among Asian and Middle Eastern patients (15.22% and 15.04%, respectively) (P = 0.781).

737,TP53 polymorphisms and lung cancer risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To examine the risk of lung cancer associated with the codon 72, intron 6 and intron 3 TP53 polymorphisms a meta-analysis of published case-control studies was undertaken. The principle outcome measure was the odds ratio (OR) for the risk of lung cancer using homozygosity of the 'wild-type allele' as the reference group. Data from 13 studies detailing the relationship between lung cancer and the codon 72 polymorphism of TP53 and three studies examining the intron 3 and 6 polymorphisms of TP53 were analysed. The ORs of lung cancer associated with the Pro-Pro and Pro-carrier genotypes of codon 72 were 1.18 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.99-1.41] and 1.02 (95% CI 0.86-1.20), respectively. The ORs of lung cancer associated with homozygous and variant allele carrier genotypes of the intron 6 (MspI RFLP) polymorphism were 1.13 (95% CI 0.55-2.27) and 1.30 (95% CI 0.75-2.26) and of the intron 3 (16 bp duplication) polymorphism were 1.50 (95% CI 0.76-2.97) and 1.11 (95% CI 0.53-2.35), respectively. Although polymorphic variations in TP53 represent attractive candidate susceptibility alleles for lung cancer the results from this analysis provide little support for this hypothesis.

2021,Targeting dna double strand break repair with hyperthermia and dna-pkcs inhibition to enhance the effect of radiation treatment.,"Radiotherapy is based on the induction of lethal DNA damage, primarily DNA double-strand breaks (DSB). Efficient DSB repair via Non-Homologous End Joining or Homologous Recombination can therefore undermine the efficacy of radiotherapy. By suppressing DNA-DSB repair with hyperthermia (HT) and DNA-PKcs inhibitor NU7441 (DNA-PKcsi), we aim to enhance the effect of radiation.The sensitizing effect of HT for 1 hour at 42°C and DNA-PKcsi [1 μM] to radiation treatment was investigated in cervical and breast cancer cells, primary breast cancer sphere cells (BCSCs) enriched for cancer stem cells, and in an in vivo human tumor model. A significant radio-enhancement effect was observed for all cell types when DNA-PKcsi and HT were applied separately, and when both were combined, HT and DNA-PKcsi enhanced radio-sensitivity to an even greater extent. Strikingly, combined treatment resulted in significantly lower survival rates, 2 to 2.5 fold increase in apoptosis, more residual DNA-DSB 6 h post treatment and a G2-phase arrest. In addition, tumor growth analysis in vivo showed significant reduction in tumor growth and elevated caspase-3 activity when radiation was combined with HT and DNA-PKcsi compared to radiation alone. Importantly, no toxic side effects of HT or DNA-PKcsi were found.In conclusion, inhibiting DNA-DSB repair using HT and DNA-PKcsi before radiotherapy leads to enhanced cytotoxicity in cancer cells. This effect was even noticed in the more radio-resistant BCSCs, which are clearly sensitized by combined treatment. Therefore, the addition of HT and DNA-PKcsi to conventional radiotherapy is promising and might contribute to more efficient tumor control and patient outcome.",nonCancer
1097,Structure-Guided Blockade of CSF1R Kinase in Tenosynovial Giant-Cell Tumor.,"Expression of the colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) gene is elevated in most tenosynovial giant-cell tumors. This observation has led to the discovery and clinical development of therapy targeting the CSF1 receptor (CSF1R). Using x-ray co-crystallography to guide our drug-discovery research, we generated a potent, selective CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397, that traps the kinase in the autoinhibited conformation. We then conducted a multicenter, phase 1 trial in two parts to analyze this compound. In the first part, we evaluated escalations in the dose of PLX3397 that was administered orally in patients with solid tumors (dose-escalation study). In the second part, we evaluated PLX3397 at the chosen phase 2 dose in an extension cohort of patients with tenosynovial giant-cell tumors (extension study). Pharmacokinetic and tumor responses in the enrolled patients were assessed, and CSF1 in situ hybridization was performed to confirm the mechanism of action of PLX3397 and that the pattern of CSF1 expression was consistent with the pathological features of tenosynovial giant-cell tumor. A total of 41 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation study, and an additional 23 patients were enrolled in the extension study. The chosen phase 2 dose of PLX3397 was 1000 mg per day. In the extension study, 12 patients with tenosynovial giant-cell tumors had a partial response and 7 patients had stable disease. Responses usually occurred within the first 4 months of treatment, and the median duration of response exceeded 8 months. The most common adverse events included fatigue, change in hair color, nausea, dysgeusia, and periorbital edema; adverse events rarely led to discontinuation of treatment. Treatment of tenosynovial giant-cell tumors with PLX3397 resulted in a prolonged regression in tumor volume in most patients. (Funded by Plexxikon; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01004861.).",cancer
2451,c-met is overexpressed in type I ovarian cancer: Results of an investigative analysis in a cohort of consecutive ovarian cancer patients.,"The tyrosine kinase c-met alters signaling cascades such as the BRAF-MAPK and PI3K-PKB pathways. These alterations are involved in the carcinogenesis of type I but not type II ovarian cancer (OC). Therefore, the present study investigated the patterns of c-met expression in a cohort of consecutive patients with OC. c-met expression was determined by immunohistochemical analysis. Differences in c-met overexpression among subgroups of established clinicopathological features, including age, histological subtype, tumor stage, histological grading, post-operative tumor burden and completeness of chemotherapy, were determined by χ(2) test. Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the prognostic effect of c-met. Survival rates were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 106 patients were enrolled into the study. c-met was overexpressed in 20.8% of the entire cohort; 35.7% of patients with type I OC and 8.6% of patients with type II OC showed overexpression (P=0.001). However, c-met overexpression was not associated with any other established clinicopathological features (all P-values >0.05). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that overexpression of c-met was associated neither with progression-free survival (PFS) nor with disease-specific survival (DSS) (P=0.835 and P=0.414, respectively). Kaplan-Meier plots also failed to demonstrate an effect of c-met on the 5-year PFS and DSS rates (P=0.938 and P=0.412, respectively). These findings support the hypotheses that the overexpression of c-met is associated with type I but not type II OC, and that overexpression of c-met does not affect the prognosis of OC.",nonCancer

There are a number of somatic tumor genetic markers that are indicative for treatment with anti-cancer drugs. By contrast, for some hereditary variants, recommendations have been developed. Although we have vast knowledge on the association between drug transporter variants and clinical outcome, the overall data is inconsistent and the predictability of the related phenotype is low. Further developments in research may lead to the discovery of rare, but functionally relevant single nucleotide polymorphisms and a better understanding of multiple genomic, epigenomic as well as phenotypic factors, contributing to drug response in malignancies.",nonCancer
93,Wilms' tumor 1 gene mutations independently predict poor outcome in adults with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia: a cancer and leukemia group B study.,"To analyze the prognostic impact of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene mutations in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). PATIENTS AND METHODS We studied 196 adults younger than 60 years with newly diagnosed primary CN-AML, who were treated similarly on Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB) protocols 9621 and 19808, for WT1 mutations in exons 7 and 9. The patients also were assessed for the presence of FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD), FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations (FLT3-TKD), MLL partial tandem duplications (MLL-PTD), NPM1 and CEBPA mutations, and for the expression levels of ERG and BAALC. Twenty-one patients (10.7%) harbored WT1 mutations. Complete remission rates were not significantly different between patients with WT1 mutations and those with unmutated WT1 (P = .36; 76% v 84%). Patients with WT1 mutations had worse disease-free survival (DFS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 13% v 50%) and overall survival (OS; P < .001; 3-year rates, 10% v 56%) than patients with unmutated WT1. In multivariable analyses, WT1 mutations independently predicted worse DFS (P = .009; hazard ratio [HR] = 2.7) when controlling for CEBPA mutational status, ERG expression level, and FLT3-ITD/NPM1 molecular-risk group (ie, FLT3-ITD(negative)/NPM1(mutated) as low risk v FLT3-ITD(positive) and/or NPM1(wild-type) as high risk). WT1 mutations also independently predicted worse OS (P < .001; HR = 3.2) when controlling for CEBPA mutational status, FLT3-ITD/NPM1 molecular-risk group, and white blood cell count. We report the first evidence that WT1 mutations independently predict extremely poor outcome in intensively treated, younger patients with CN-AML. Future trials should include testing for WT1 mutations as part of molecularly based risk assessment and risk-adapted treatment stratification of patients with CN-AML.",cancer
2153,High-molecular-weight organic matter in the particles of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.,"The presence of solid carbonaceous matter in cometary dust was established by the detection of elements such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen in particles from comet 1P/Halley. Such matter is generally thought to have originated in the interstellar medium, but it might have formed in the solar nebula-the cloud of gas and dust that was left over after the Sun formed. This solid carbonaceous material cannot be observed from Earth, so it has eluded unambiguous characterization. Many gaseous organic molecules, however, have been observed; they come mostly from the sublimation of ices at the surface or in the subsurface of cometary nuclei. These ices could have been formed from material inherited from the interstellar medium that suffered little processing in the solar nebula. Here we report the in situ detection of solid organic matter in the dust particles emitted by comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko; the carbon in this organic material is bound in very large macromolecular compounds, analogous to the insoluble organic matter found in the carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. The organic matter in meteorites might have formed in the interstellar medium and/or the solar nebula, but was almost certainly modified in the meteorites' parent bodies. We conclude that the observed cometary carbonaceous solid matter could have the same origin as the meteoritic insoluble organic matter, but suffered less modification before and/or after being incorporated into the comet.",nonCancer
2469,Famitinib exerted powerful antitumor activity in human gastric cancer cells and xenografts.,"Famitinib (SHR1020), a novel multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has antitumor activity against several solid tumors via targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, c-Kit and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β. The present study investigated famitinib's activity against human gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured, and cell cycle analysis was performed following famitinib treatment using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol -2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and western blotting. Subsequently, cluster of differentiation 34 staining was used to evaluate microvessel density. BGC-823-derived xenografts in nude mice were established to assess drug efficacy in vivo. Famitinib inhibited cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and caused cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in gastric cancer cell lines. In BGC-823 xenograft models, famitinib significantly slowed tumor growth in vivo via inhibition of angiogenesis. Compared with other chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin or paclitaxel alone, famitinib exhibited the greatest tumor suppression effect (>85% inhibition). The present study demonstrated for the first time that famitinib has efficacy against human gastric cancer in vitro and in vivo, which may lay the foundations for future clinical trials.",nonCancer
1245,AEBP1 upregulation confers acquired resistance to BRAF (V600E) inhibition in melanoma.,"An activating BRAF (V600E) kinase mutation occurs in approximately half of melanomas. Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib, potent and selective inhibitors of mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF), exhibit remarkable activities in patients with V600 BRAF mutant melanomas. However, acquired drug resistance invariably develops after the initial treatment. Identification of acquired resistance mechanisms may inform the development of new therapies that elicit long-term responses of melanomas to BRAF inhibitors. Here we report that increased expression of AEBP1 (adipocyte enhancer-binding protein 1) confers acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma. AEBP1 is shown to be highly upregulated in PLX4032-resistant melanoma cells because of the hyperactivation of the PI3K/Akt-cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway. This upregulates AEBP1 expression and thus leads to the activation of NF-κB via accelerating IκBa degradation. In addition, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway greatly reverses the PLX4032-resistant phenotype of melanoma cells. Furthermore, increased expression of AEBP1 is validated in post-treatment tumors in patients with acquired resistance to BRAF inhibitor. Therefore, these results reveal a novel PI3K/Akt-CREB-AEBP1-NF-κB pathway whose activation contributes to acquired resistance to BRAF inhibition, and suggest that this pathway, particularly AEBP1, may represent a novel therapeutic target for treating BRAF inhibitor-resistant melanoma.",cancer
417,Sphingosine kinase 1 is a reliable prognostic factor and a novel therapeutic target for uterine cervical cancer.,"Sphingosine kinase 1 (SPHK1), an oncogenic kinase, has previously been found to be upregulated in various types of human malignancy and to play a crucial role in tumor development and progression. Although SPHK1 has gained increasing prominence as an important enzyme in cancer biology, its potential as a predictive biomarker and a therapeutic target in cervical cancer remains unknown. SPHK1 expression was examined in 287 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues using immunohistochemistry, and its clinical implications and prognostic significance were analyzed. Cervical cancer cell lines including HeLa and SiHa were treated with the SPHK inhibitors SKI-II or FTY720, and effects on cell survival, apoptosis, angiogenesis, and invasion were examined. Moreover, the effects of FTY720 on tumor growth were evaluated using a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of cervical cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that expression of SPHK1 was significantly increased in cervical cancer compared with normal tissues. SPHK1 expression was significantly associated with tumor size, invasion depth, FIGO stage, lymph node metastasis, and lymphovascular invasion. Patients with high SPHK1 expression had lower overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates than those with low expression. Treatment with SPHK inhibitors significantly reduced viability and increased apoptosis in cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, FTY720 significantly decreased in vivo tumor weight in the PDX model of cervical cancer. We provide the first convincing evidence that SPHK1 is involved in tumor development and progression of cervical cancer. Our data suggest that SPHK1 might be a potential prognostic marker and therapeutic target for the treatment of cervical cancer.",cancer
2520,Discriminating agonist and antagonist ligands of the nuclear receptors using 3D-pharmacophores.,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) constitute an important class of therapeutic targets. We evaluated the performance of 3D structure-based and ligand-based pharmacophore models in predicting the pharmacological profile of NRs ligands using the NRLiSt BDB database. We could generate selective pharmacophores for agonist and antagonist ligands and we found that the best performances were obtained by combining the structure-based and the ligand-based approaches. The combination of pharmacophores that were generated allowed to cover most of the chemical space of the NRLiSt BDB datasets. By screening the whole NRLiSt BDB on our 3D pharmacophores, we demonstrated their selectivity towards their dedicated NRs ligands. The 3D pharmacophores herein presented can thus be used as a predictor of the pharmacological activity of NRs ligands.Graphical AbstractUsing a combination of structure-based and ligand-based pharmacophores, agonist and antagonist ligands of the Nuclear Receptors included in the NRLiSt BDB database could be separated.",nonCancer
1537,The Effects of Influenza Vaccination during Pregnancy on Birth Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Objective Numerous observational studies have evaluated the relationship between influenza vaccination during pregnancy and birth outcomes. The number of studies on this subject has increased, especially after the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic (A/H1N1pdm09). This meta-analysis aims to determine the impact of maternal vaccination with either seasonal trivalent inactivated influenza vaccines (IIV) or A/H1N1pdm09 monovalent vaccines on the rates of preterm (PTB), small for gestational age (SGA), and low birth weight (LBW) births. Methods English language randomized controlled trials and observational studies assessing the proposed outcomes after administration of influenza vaccine during pregnancy were screened. Observational studies were included if they presented adjusted measures and if the total number of women evaluated reached predefined thresholds. Sensitivity analyses were performed, including all published observational studies irrespectively of the sample size. Results A total of 5 and 13 publications that assessed the impact of IIV and monovalent A/H1N1pdm09 vaccines, respectively, fulfilled the inclusion criteria for the main analyses. The rate of PTB and LBW was lower in women who received IIV during pregnancy compared with nonvaccinated women (odds ratio [OR]: 0.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.77, 0.98 for PTB and OR: 0.74; 95% CI: 0.61, 0.88 for LBW); and in women vaccinated with monovalent A/H1N1pdm09 versus nonvaccinated women (OR: 0.92; 95% CI: 0.85, 0.99 for PTB and OR: 0.88; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.98 for LBW). No significant impact of vaccination on SGA birth rates was detected in the main analyses independently of the vaccine group. Conclusion Receipt of influenza vaccine during pregnancy was associated with a decreased risk of PTB and LBW.",nonCancer
2073,Cord-Blood Transplantation in Patients with Minimal Residual Disease.,"Background The majority of patients in need of a hematopoietic-cell transplant do not have a matched related donor. Data are needed to inform the choice among various alternative donor-cell sources. Methods In this retrospective analysis, we compared outcomes in 582 consecutive patients with acute leukemia or the myelodysplastic syndrome who received a first myeloablative hematopoietic-cell transplant from an unrelated cord-blood donor (140 patients), an HLA-matched unrelated donor (344), or an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor (98). Results The relative risks of death and relapse between the cord-blood group and the two other unrelated-donor groups appeared to vary according to the presence of minimal residual disease status before transplantation. Among patients with minimal residual disease, the risk of death was higher in the HLA-mismatched group than in the cord-blood group (hazard ratio, 2.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52 to 5.63; P=0.001); the risk was also higher in the HLA-matched group than in the cord-blood group but not significantly so (hazard ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 0.94 to 3.02; P=0.08). Among patients without minimal residual disease, the hazard ratios were lower (hazard ratio in the HLA-mismatched group, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.76 to 2.46; P=0.30; hazard ratio in the HLA-matched group, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.48 to 1.28; P=0.33). The risk of relapse among patients with minimal residual disease was significantly higher in the two unrelated-donor groups than in the cord-blood group (hazard ratio in the HLA-mismatched group, 3.01; 95% CI, 1.22 to 7.38; P=0.02; hazard ratio in the HLA-matched group, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.34 to 6.35; P=0.007). Among patients without minimal residual disease, the magnitude of these associations was lower (hazard ratio in the HLA-mismatched group, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.51 to 3.25; P=0.60; hazard ratio in the HLA-matched group, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.65 to 2.58; P=0.46). Conclusions Our data suggest that among patients with pretransplantation minimal residual disease, the probability of overall survival after receipt of a transplant from a cord-blood donor was at least as favorable as that after receipt of a transplant from an HLA-matched unrelated donor and was significantly higher than the probability after receipt of a transplant from an HLA-mismatched unrelated donor. Furthermore, the probability of relapse was lower in the cord-blood group than in either of the other groups.",nonCancer
106,Comparison of clinical outcomes following gefitinib and erlotinib treatment in non-small-cell lung cancer patients harboring an epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in either exon 19 or 21.,"Gefitinib and erlotinib, small-molecule kinase inhibitors that block epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, have demonstrated a dramatic response rate and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) in patients harboring an activating EGFR mutation. We compared the clinical outcomes in gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated patients harboring EGFR mutations who had recurrent or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total of 375 patients with recurrent or metastatic stage IIIB/IV NSCLC, who had either exon 19 deletion or the L858R mutation in exon 21, and had received either gefitinib (n = 228) or erlotinib (n = 147), were included in the study. A matched-pair case-control study design was implemented in the analysis, where 121 pairs of gefitinib-treated and erlotinib-treated patients were matched according to sex, smoking history, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, and types of EGFR mutation. The median age of all patients was 58 years (range, 30-84), and more than half of patients had never been smokers (63.6%). Most patients had adenocarcinoma (98.3%) and good Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0, 1) (90.9%). The median number of cycles of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment was 12.7 in the gefitinib group and 10.8 in the erlotinib group. Of the 242 patients, 63 (26%) received EGFR TKI as first-line therapy. The overall response rates and disease control rates in the gefitinib- or erlotinib-treated groups were 76.9% versus 74.4% (p = 0.575) and 90.1% versus 86.8%, respectively (p = 0.305). There was no statistically significant difference with regard to PFS (median, 11.7 versus 9.6; p = 0.056) between the gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated groups. For patients receiving EGFR TKI as the first-line treatment, there was no significant difference between the two treatment groups in overall response rates (76.7% and 90.0%) (p = 0.431) and median PFS (11.7 versus 14.5 months) (p = 0.507). In NSCLC patients harboring EGFR mutation, treatment with gefitinib and erlotinib resulted in similar effectiveness.",cancer
879,PD-1 Blockade with Pembrolizumab in Advanced Merkel-Cell Carcinoma.,"Merkel-cell carcinoma is an aggressive skin cancer that is linked to exposure to ultraviolet light and the Merkel-cell polyomavirus (MCPyV). Advanced Merkel-cell carcinoma often responds to chemotherapy, but responses are transient. Blocking the programmed death 1 (PD-1) immune inhibitory pathway is of interest, because these tumors often express PD-L1, and MCPyV-specific T cells express PD-1. In this multicenter, phase 2, noncontrolled study, we assigned adults with advanced Merkel-cell carcinoma who had received no previous systemic therapy to receive pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) at a dose of 2 mg per kilogram of body weight every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Efficacy was correlated with tumor viral status, as assessed by serologic and immunohistochemical testing. A total of 26 patients received at least one dose of pembrolizumab. The objective response rate among the 25 patients with at least one evaluation during treatment was 56% (95% confidence interval [CI], 35 to 76); 4 patients had a complete response, and 10 had a partial response. With a median follow-up of 33 weeks (range, 7 to 53), relapses occurred in 2 of the 14 patients who had had a response (14%). The response duration ranged from at least 2.2 months to at least 9.7 months. The rate of progression-free survival at 6 months was 67% (95% CI, 49 to 86). A total of 17 of the 26 patients (65%) had virus-positive tumors. The response rate was 62% among patients with MCPyV-positive tumors (10 of 16 patients) and 44% among those with virus-negative tumors (4 of 9 patients). Drug-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in 15% of the patients. In this study, first-line therapy with pembrolizumab in patients with advanced Merkel-cell carcinoma was associated with an objective response rate of 56%. Responses were observed in patients with virus-positive tumors and those with virus-negative tumors.

2495,Comparative effect of immature neuronal or glial cell transplantation on motor functional recovery following experimental traumatic brain injury in rats.,"The present study evaluated the comparative effect of stereotaxically transplanted immature neuronal or glial cells in brain on motor functional recovery and cytokine expression after cold-induced traumatic brain injury (TBI) in adult rats. A total of 60 rats were divided into four groups (n=15/group): Sham group; TBI only group; TBI plus neuronal cells-transplanted group (NC-G); and TBI plus glial cells-transplanted group (GC-G). Cortical lesions were induced by a touching metal stamp, frozen with liquid nitrogen, to the dura mater over the motor cortex of adult rats. Neuronal and glial cells were isolated from rat embryonic and newborn cortices, respectively, and cultured in culture flasks. Rats received neurons or glia grafts (~1×10(6) cells) 5 days after TBI was induced. Motor functional evaluation was performed with the rotarod test prior to and following glial and neural cell grafts. Five rats from each group were sacrificed at 2, 4 and 6 weeks post-cell transplantation. Immunofluorescence staining was performed on brain section to identify the transplanted neuronal or glial cells using neural and astrocytic markers. The expression levels of cytokines, including transforming growth factor-β, glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor and vascular endothelial growth factor, which have key roles in the proliferation, differentiation and survival of neural cells, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. A localized cortical lesion was evoked in all injured rats, resulting in significant motor deficits. Transplanted cells successfully migrated and survived in the injured brain lesion, and the expression of neuronal and astrocyte markers were detected in the NC-G and GC-G groups, respectively. Rats in the NC-G and GC-G cell-transplanted groups exhibited significant motor functional recovery and reduced histopathologic lesions, as compared with the TBI-G rats that did not receive neural cells (P<0.05, respectively). Furthermore, GC-G treatment induced significantly improved motor functional recovery, as compared with the NC-G group (P<0.05). Increased cytokine expression levels were detected in the NC-G and GC-G groups, as compared with the TBI-G; however, no differences were found between the two groups. These data suggested that transplanted immature neural cells may promote the survival of neural cells in cortical lesion and motor functional recovery. Furthermore, transplanted glial cells may be used as an effective therapeutic tool for TBI patients with abnormalities in motor functional recovery and cytokine expression.",nonCancer
119,Clinical implications of KRAS mutations in lung cancer patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors: an important role for mutations in minor clones.,"Mutations inducing resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) therapy may have a clinical impact even if present in minor cell clones which could expand during treatment. We tested this hypothesis in lung cancer patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Eighty-three patients with lung adenocarcinoma treated with erlotinib or gefitinib were included in this study. The mutational status of KRAS and EGFR was investigated by direct sequencing (DS). KRAS mutations were also assessed by mutant-enriched sequencing (ME-sequencing). DS detected KRAS mutations in 16 (19%) of 83 tumors; ME-sequencing identified all the mutations detected by DS but also mutations in minor clones of 14 additional tumors, for a total of 30 (36%) of 83. KRAS mutations assessed by DS and ME-sequencing significantly correlated with resistance to TKIs (P = .04 and P = .004, respectively) and significantly affected progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). However, the predictive power of mutations assessed by ME-sequencing was higher than that obtained by DS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.82, P = .0001 vs HR = 1.98, P = .04, respectively, for OS; HR = 2.52, P = .0005 vs HR = 2.21, P = .007, respectively, for PFS). Survival outcome of patients harboring KRAS mutations in minor clones, detected only by ME-sequencing, did not differ from that of patients with KRAS mutations detected by DS. Only KRAS mutations assessed by ME-sequencing remained an independent predictive factor at multivariate analysis. KRAS mutations in minor clones have an important impact on response and survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma treated with EGFR-TKI. The use of sensitive detection methods could allow to more effectively identify treatment-resistant patients.",cancer
431,RSF1 and not cyclin D1 gene amplification may predict lack of benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen in high-risk pre-menopausal women in the MA.12 randomized clinical trial.,"Most women with estrogen receptor expressing breast cancers receiving anti-estrogens such as tamoxifen may not need or benefit from them. Besides the estrogen receptor, there are no predictive biomarkers to help select breast cancer patients for tamoxifen treatment. CCND1 (cyclin D1) gene amplification is a putative candidate tamoxifen predictive biomarker. The RSF1 (remodeling and spacing factor 1) gene is frequently co-amplified with CCND1 on chromosome 11q. We validated the predictive value of these biomarkers in the MA.12 randomized study of adjuvant tamoxifen vs. placebo in high-risk premenopausal early breast cancer. Premenopausal women with node-positive/high-risk node-negative early breast cancer received standard adjuvant chemotherapy and then were randomized to tamoxifen (20 mg/day) or placebo for 5 yrs. Overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) were evaluated. Fluorescent in-situ hybridization was performed on a tissue microarray of 495 breast tumors (74% of patients) to measure CCND1 and RSF1 copy number. A multivariate Cox model to obtain hazard ratios (HR) adjusting for clinico-pathologic factors was used to assess the effect of these biomarkers on Os and RFS. 672 women were followed for a median of 8.4 years. We were able to measure the DNA copy number of CCND1 in 442 patients and RSF1 in 413 patients. CCND1 gene amplification was observed in 8.7% and RSF1 in 6.8% of these patients, preferentially in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancers. No statistically significant interaction with treatment was observed for either CCND1 or RSF1 amplification, although patients with high RSF1 copy number did not show benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen (HR = 1.11, interaction p = 0.09). Unlike CCND1 amplification, RSF1 amplification may predict for outcome in high-risk premenopausal breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant tamoxifen.",cancer
990,High-speed biosensing strategy for non-invasive profiling of multiple cancer fusion genes in urine.,"Aberrant chromosal rearrangements, such as the multiple variants of TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene mutations in prostate cancer (PCa), are promising diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers due to their specific expression in cancerous tissue only. Additionally, TMPRSS2:ERG variants are detectable in urine to provide non-invasive PCa diagnostic sampling as an attractive surrogate for needle biopsies. Therefore, rapid and simplistic assays for identifying multiple urinary TMPRSS2:ERG variants are potentially useful to aid in early cancer detection, immediate patient risk stratification, and prompt personalized treatment. However, current strategies for simultaneous detection of multiple gene fusions are limited by tedious and prolonged experimental protocols, thus limiting their use as rapid clinical screening tools. Herein, we report a simple and rapid gene fusion strategy which expliots the specificity of DNA ligase and the speed of isothermal amplification to simultaneously detect multiple fusion gene RNAs within a short sample-to-answer timeframe of 60min. The method has a low detection limit of 2 amol (1000 copies), and was successfully applied for non-invasive fusion gene profiling in patient urine samples with subsequent validation by a PCR-based gold standard approach.",cancer
157,The prognostic IDH1( R132 ) mutation is associated with reduced NADP+-dependent IDH activity in glioblastoma.,"Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) occur at high frequency in gliomas and seem to be a prognostic factor for survival in glioblastoma patients. In our set of 98 glioblastoma patients, IDH1 ( R132 ) mutations were associated with improved survival of 1 year on average, after correcting for age and other variables with Cox proportional hazards models. Patients with IDH1 mutations were on average 17 years younger than patients without mutation. Mutated IDH1 has a gain of function to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate by NADPH-dependent reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, but it is unknown whether NADPH production in gliomas is affected by IDH1 mutations. We assessed the effect of IDH1 (R132 ) mutations on IDH-mediated NADPH production in glioblastomas in situ. Metabolic mapping and image analysis was applied to 51 glioblastoma samples of which 16 carried an IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. NADP+-dependent IDH activity was determined in comparison with activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and all other NADPH-producing dehydrogenases, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The occurrence of IDH1 mutations correlated with approx. twofold diminished NADP+-dependent IDH activity, whereas activity of NAD+-dependent IDH and the other NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases was not affected in situ in glioblastoma. The total NADPH production capacity in glioblastoma was provided for 65% by IDH activity and the occurrence of IDH1 (R132 ) mutation reduced this capacity by 38%. It is concluded that NADPH production is hampered in glioblastoma with IDH1 (R132 ) mutation. Moreover, mutated IDH1 consumes rather than produces NADPH, thus likely lowering NADPH levels even further. The low NADPH levels may sensitize glioblastoma to irradiation and chemotherapy, thus explaining the prolonged survival of patients with mutated glioblastoma.",cancer
1239,O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase expression in tumor cells predicts outcome of radiotherapy plus concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide therapy in patients with primary glioblastoma.,"Expression of the O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene has been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes in patients with glioblastoma multiforme treated with alkylating agents. We evaluated MGMT protein expression in 53 primary glioblastomas by the immunohistochemistry (IHC) and analyzed the correlation between results of immunostaining and patient outcomes. There were 28 MGMT-immunopositive and 25 negative glioblastomas. Patients with MGMT-immunonegative glioblastomas showed significantly longer progression-free survival (PFS) (P = 0.0032), but no statistically significant benefits on overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0825) were shown. In 41 glioblastomas treated with temozolomide (TMZ) therapy (MGMT-immunopositive: n = 22, negative: n = 19), both PFS and OS were significantly better in MGMT-immunonegative glioblastomas. (PFS: P = 0.0015, OS: P = 0.0384). We conclude that MGMT expression on immunohistochemistry (IHC) correlates with outcomes in patients with primary glioblastoma receiving TMZ and suggest the use of MGMT-IHC as a surrogate marker for predicting tumor chemosensitivity.",cancer

We sought to determine whether the humanized anti-CD52 antibody alemtuzumab was effective in this patient group. Thirty-six patients with fludarabine-refractory CLL were treated with alemtuzumab, 15 (42%) of whom had p53 mutations or deletions. Clinical responses in patients with p53 mutations, deletions, or both were noted in 6 (40%) of 15 versus 4 (19%) of 21 of patients without. The median response duration for this subset of patients was 8 months (range, 3-17 months).

653,Association of Nuclear PIM1 Expression with Lymph Node Metastasis and Poor Prognosis in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma and Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Increasing evidence indicates that aberrant expression of PIM1, p-STAT3 and c-MYC is involved in the pathogenesis of various solid tumors, but its prognostic value is still unclear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we sought to evaluate the expression and prognostic role of these markers in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (AD) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Real time RT-PCR and Western blotting was used to analyze the mRNA and protein expression of PIM1 in NSCLC cell lines, respectively. The expression of PIM1, p-STAT3, and c-MYC was immunohistochemically tested in archival tumor samples from 194 lung AD and SCC patients. High nuclear PIM1 expression was detected in 43.3% of ADs and SCCs, and was significantly correlated with lymph node (LN) metastasis (P = 0.028) and histology (P = 0.003). High nuclear PIM1 expression (P = 0.034), locally advanced stage (P < 0.001), AD (P = 0.007) and poor pathologic differentiation (P = 0.002) were correlated with worse disease-free survival (DFS). High nuclear PIM1 expression (P = 0.009), advanced clinical stage (P < 0.001) and poor pathologic differentiation (P = 0.004) were independent unfavorable prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). High p-STAT3 expression was not associated with OS but significantly correlated with LN metastasis, while c-MYC was not significantly correlated with any clinicopathological parameter or survival. Therefore, in AD and SCC patients, nuclear PIM1 expression level is an independent factor for DFS and OS and it might serve as a predictive biomarker for outcome.",cancer
408,KRAS Genomic Status Predicts the Sensitivity of Ovarian Cancer Cells to Decitabine.,"Decitabine, a cancer therapeutic that inhibits DNA methylation, produces variable antitumor response rates in patients with solid tumors that might be leveraged clinically with identification of a predictive biomarker. In this study, we profiled the response of human ovarian, melanoma, and breast cancer cells treated with decitabine, finding that RAS/MEK/ERK pathway activation and DNMT1 expression correlated with cytotoxic activity. Further, we showed that KRAS genomic status predicted decitabine sensitivity in low-grade and high-grade serous ovarian cancer cells. Pretreatment with decitabine decreased the cytotoxic activity of MEK inhibitors in KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer cells, with reciprocal downregulation of DNMT1 and MEK/ERK phosphorylation. In parallel with these responses, decitabine also upregulated the proapoptotic BCL-2 family member BNIP3, which is known to be regulated by MEK and ERK, and heightened the activity of proapoptotic small-molecule navitoclax, a BCL-2 family inhibitor. In a xenograft model of KRAS-mutant ovarian cancer, combining decitabine and navitoclax heightened antitumor activity beyond administration of either compound alone. Our results define the RAS/MEK/DNMT1 pathway as a determinant of sensitivity to DNA methyltransferase inhibition, specifically implicating KRAS status as a biomarker of drug response in ovarian cancer.",cancer

The results of the surgery were evaluated using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS) scale.|the results at 10-15 years of follow-up were excellent in 94.5% of these cases and good in the remaining 5.5%. An increase of 31.2 points in the AOFAS scale score was recorded at follow-up (with the score rising to 98.8, from 67.6 preoperatively). All the athletes returned to their respective sports at the same level as prior to the surgery.

2320,Microbe-ID: an open source toolbox for microbial genotyping and species identification.,"Development of tools to identify species, genotypes, or novel strains of invasive organisms is critical for monitoring emergence and implementing rapid response measures. Molecular markers, although critical to identifying species or genotypes, require bioinformatic tools for analysis. However, user-friendly analytical tools for fast identification are not readily available. To address this need, we created a web-based set of applications called Microbe-ID that allow for customizing a toolbox for rapid species identification and strain genotyping using any genetic markers of choice. Two components of Microbe-ID, named Sequence-ID and Genotype-ID, implement species and genotype identification, respectively. Sequence-ID allows identification of species by using BLAST to query sequences for any locus of interest against a custom reference sequence database. Genotype-ID allows placement of an unknown multilocus marker in either a minimum spanning network or dendrogram with bootstrap support from a user-created reference database. Microbe-ID can be used for identification of any organism based on nucleotide sequences or any molecular marker type and several examples are provided. We created a public website for demonstration purposes called Microbe-ID (microbe-id.org) and provided a working implementation for the genus Phytophthora (phytophthora-id.org). In Phytophthora-ID, the Sequence-ID application allows identification based on ITS or cox spacer sequences. Genotype-ID groups individuals into clonal lineages based on simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers for the two invasive plant pathogen species P. infestans and P. ramorum. All code is open source and available on github and CRAN. Instructions for installation and use are provided at https://github.com/grunwaldlab/Microbe-ID.",nonCancer
1692,Molecular Self-Assembly Versus Surface Restructuring During Calcite Dissolution.,"Organic additives are known to alter the mineral-water interface in various ways. On the one hand, organic molecules can self-assemble into ordered structures wetting the surface. On the other hand, their presence can affect the interfacial morphology, referred to as surface restructuring. Here, we investigate the impact of a class of calcium-complexing azo dyes on the dissolution of calcite (10.4) using high-resolution atomic force microscopy operated in aqueous solution, with a focus on the two constitutional isomers Eriochrome Black T and Eriochrome Black A. A very pronounced surface restructuring is observed in the presence of the dye solution, irrespective of the specific dye used and independent of the pH. This surface restructuring is obtained by the stabilization of both the non-polar acute and the polar [010] step edges, resulting in a greatly altered, characteristic interface morphology. In sharp contrast to the prevalence of the surface restructuring, an ordered molecular structure on the crystal terraces is observed only under very specific conditions. This formation of an ordered stripe-like molecular structure is obtained from Eriochrome Black A only and limited to a very narrow pH window at a pH value of around 3.6. Our results indicate that such molecular self-assembly requires a rather precise adjustment of the molecular properties including control of the conformation and deprotonation state. This is in sharp contrast to the additive-induced surface restructuring, which appears to be far more robust against both pH changes and variations in the molecular conformation.",nonCancer
2297,Bunyaviruses are common in male and female Ixodes scapularis ticks in central Pennsylvania.,"The blacklegged tick Ixodes scapularis is widely distributed in the United States and transmits multiple pathogens to humans, wildlife and domestic animals. Recently, several novel viruses in the family Bunyaviridae (South Bay virus (SBV) and Blacklegged tick phlebovirus (BTPV)) were identified infecting female I. scapularis ticks collected in New York State. We used metagenomic sequencing to investigate the distribution of viruses infecting male and female I. scapularis ticks collected in Centre County, Pennsylvania. We identified both SBV and BTPV in both male and female ticks from all collection locations. The role of male I. scapularis in pathogen epidemiology has been overlooked because they rarely bite and are not considered important pathogen vectors. However, males may act as reservoirs for pathogens that can then be transmitted to females during mating. Our data highlight the importance of examining all potential avenues of pathogen maintenance and transmission throughout the vector-pathogen life cycle in order to understand the epidemiology of tick-borne pathogens.",nonCancer
342,New IDH1 mutant inhibitors for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.,"Neomorphic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) are driver mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other cancers. We report the development of new allosteric inhibitors of mutant IDH1. Crystallographic and biochemical results demonstrated that compounds of this chemical series bind to an allosteric site and lock the enzyme in a catalytically inactive conformation, thereby enabling inhibition of different clinically relevant IDH1 mutants. Treatment of IDH1 mutant primary AML cells uniformly led to a decrease in intracellular 2-HG, abrogation of the myeloid differentiation block and induction of granulocytic differentiation at the level of leukemic blasts and more immature stem-like cells, in vitro and in vivo. Molecularly, treatment with the inhibitors led to a reversal of the DNA cytosine hypermethylation patterns caused by mutant IDH1 in the cells of individuals with AML. Our study provides proof of concept for the molecular and biological activity of novel allosteric inhibitors for targeting different mutant forms of IDH1 in leukemia.",cancer
446,TP53 mutational status and cetuximab benefit in rectal cancer: 5-year results of the EXPERT-C trial.,"In this updated analysis of the EXPERT-C trial we show that, in magnetic resonance imaging-defined, high-risk, locally advanced rectal cancer, adding cetuximab to a treatment strategy with neoadjuvant CAPOX followed by chemoradiotherapy, surgery, and adjuvant CAPOX is not associated with a statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in both KRAS/BRAF wild-type and unselected patients. In a retrospective biomarker analysis, TP53 was not prognostic but emerged as an independent predictive biomarker for cetuximab benefit. After a median follow-up of 65.0 months, TP53 wild-type patients (n = 69) who received cetuximab had a statistically significant better PFS (89.3% vs 65.0% at 5 years; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.23; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.07 to 0.78; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) and OS (92.7% vs 67.5% at 5 years; HR = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.70; two-sided P = .02 by Cox regression) than TP53 wild-type patients who were treated in the control arm.

1997,The Prospect of Salophen in Fluorescence Lifetime Sensing of Al<sup>3+<sup>.,"We have assessed the potential of salophen, a tetradentate Schiff base, in fluorescence sensing of Al3+ ions. While performing this investigation, we have noticed conflicting literature reports on the fluorescence spectral maximum and quantum yield of salophen. So, the compound has been purified by repeated crystallization. Fluorescence studies have been performed on samples in which the absorption and excitation spectra are completely superimposable. The purified compound exhibits a feeble fluorescence at 545 nm, associated with an ultrafast fluorescence decay. This is rationalized by excited state proton transfer and torsional motions within the molecule, which provide efficient nonradiative channels of deactivation of its excited state. The fluorescence quantum yield increases upon complexation of salophen with Zn2+ as well as Al3+. The increase is significantly more upon complexation with Al3+. However, fluorescence maxima are similar for the two complexes. This indicates that fluorescence intensity may not be a good parameter for Al3+ sensing by salophen, in the presence of a large excess of Zn2+. This problem can be circumvented if fluorescence lifetime is used as the sensing parameter, as the lifetime of the Al3+ complex is in nanosecond time regime while that of the Zn2+ complex is in tens of picosecond. The significant difference in the fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime between the two complexes is explained as follows: the Al3+ complex is monomeric, but the Zn2+ complex is dimeric. Quantum chemical calculations indicate a higher density of states near the locally excited state for the dimeric complex. This may lead to more efficient non-radiate pathways.",nonCancer
1498,Tunicamycin enhances human colon cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by JNK-CHOP-mediated DR5 upregulation and the inhibition of the EGFR pathway.,"Tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a cytokine that selectively induces apoptosis in many tumor cells while leaving normal cells intact and is thus an attractive candidate for antitumor therapies. This paper reports that the combination of tunicamycin plus TRAIL produced a strong synergistic effect in TRAIL-sensitive human colon cancer HCT116 cells and TRAIL-resistant HT-29 cells. On a cellular mechanistic level, tunicamycin-enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis by death receptor (DR) 5 upregulation and DR4 deglycosylation. Knockdown of DR5 but not DR4 expression by specific shRNAs or siRNAs significantly increased tunicamycin-mediated and TRAIL-mediated cell viability. DR5 induction was regulated by C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and JNK as CHOP siRNA or JNK inhibitor SP600125 considerably abolished the DR5 induction. In addition, tunicamycin inhibited epidermal growth factor receptor glycosylation and the downstream signaling pathways, Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinases activation, which might also be required for TRAIL sensitization by tunicamycin. In summary, tunicamycin effectively enhanced TRAIL-induced apoptosis might through JNK-CHOP-mediated DR5 upregulation and the inhibition of the epidermal growth factor receptor pathway.",nonCancer
649,Nuclear heat shock protein 110 expression is associated with poor prognosis and chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer.,"Heat shock protein (HSP) expression is induced by the exposure to stress, such as fever, oxidative stress, chemical exposure, and irradiation. In cancer, HSP promotes the survival of malignant cells by inhibiting the induction of apoptosis. In colorectal cancer, a loss-of-function mutation of HSP110 (HSP110ΔE9) has been identified. HSP110ΔE9 inhibits the nuclear translocation of wild-type HSP110, which is important for its chaperone activity and anti-apoptotic effects. The patients carrying HSP110ΔE9 mutation exhibit high sensitivity to anticancer agents, such as oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil. There is still insufficient information about HSP110 localization, the clinicopathological significance of HSP110 expression, and its association with chemotherapy resistance in gastric cancer. Here, we found that high nuclear expression of HSP110 in gastric cancer tissues is associated with cancer progression, poor prognosis, and recurrence after adjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro results showed that HSP110 suppression increases the sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin of human gastric cancer cell lines. Our results suggest that nuclear HSP110 may be a new drug sensitivity marker for gastric cancer and a potential molecular therapeutic target for the treatment of gastric cancer patients with acquired anticancer drug resistance.",cancer

The aim of this paper is to review all the existing literature evidence on the surgical treatment of OLTs in athletes, in order to determine the current state of the art in this specific population, underlining both the limits and the potential of the strategies used.|a systematic review of the literature was performed focusing on the different types of surgical treatment used for OLTs in athletes. The screening process and analysis were performed separately by two independent researchers.

1401,Bioidentical Estrogen for Menopausal Depressive Symptoms: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Proponents of bioidentical estrogens claim that they are superior for treating menopausal symptoms, including depressive symptoms. Small trials examining the effects of bioidentical estrogens on depressive symptoms show conflicting results. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical estrogens for treatment of depressive symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women.|We searched the scientific literature for randomized controlled trials of at least 4 weeks duration, comparing bioidentical estrogen with placebo for depressive symptoms in menopausal women. The main outcome measure was improvement in depressive symptoms on a validated scale.|We found 12 clinical trials that met inclusion criteria, two of which contained insufficient data for quantitative analysis. In the 10 studies (inclusive of 1208 subjects) for which complete data were available for inclusion in the meta-analysis, bioidentical estrogen had no clinically significant effect on depressive symptoms (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.02; confidence interval [95% CI] -0.41 to +0.38). Pooled studies were highly heterogeneous, and numerous approaches to reducing heterogeneity were unsuccessful. Subgroup analyses showed no significant difference in effect for women treated with adjunctive progestogen, women treated with unopposed estrogen, perimenopausal, or postmenopausal and mixed populations. A possible benefit in perimenopausal women treated with unopposed estradiol may have been diluted by studies including older postmenopausal women whose depressive symptoms were unrelated to menopause.|In this first systematic review of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, we found that bioidentical estrogen has no clear benefit in treating depressive symptoms in menopausal women, but heterogeneity of available studies limits the potential for definitive conclusions. Future research should compare bioidentical estrogen with nonbioidentical estrogen for treatment of depressive symptoms in perimenopausal women.",nonCancer

Group A served as the control group. The rats in groups B to D received 30 ppm of 4-NQO in drinking water for 12 weeks. Additionally, the rats in groups B and C received Viola Odorata syrup at doses of 15 and 5 ml/kg, respectively, 3 times a week. Body weights were measured three times a week. At the end, the rats were euthanized and the tongue was removed. Histological evaluations for carcinogenesis were carried out under a light microscope.|The mean body weight of the rats in groups B, C, and D were lower than that in group A (p< 0.01). After 12 weeks of treatment, microscopically no histological changes of the tongue base epithelia were observed in the control group. The rats in group B did not show severe dysplastic changes; only mild to moderate histological changes including hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis were evident. These incidences were significantly more apparent in groups C with moderate to severe changes (p< 0.05) and group D with severe dysplastic changes (p< 0.01).

162,"Cyclin D2, but not cyclin D1, overexpression closely correlates with gastric cancer progression and prognosis.","Expression of cyclins D1 and D2, as well as cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (cdk4), was investigated by means of immunohistochemistry in 455 gastric cancer cases. Additional western blotting was performed for four breast cancer and four gastric cancer cell lines and 35 fresh frozen gastric cancer samples, to confirm the cyclin D1, D2, and cdk4 data. Cyclin D1 was restricted to the nucleus of cancer cells with a few exceptions, whereas cyclin D2 was present in both cell compartments, but predominantly in the cytoplasm. Cdk4 was intermediately expressed. Cyclin D1 was overexpressed in 93 cases (20.4 per cent) and cyclin D2 in 105 (23.0 per cent). In the cyclin D2 cases, this correlated with greater age (p=0.0004), better differentiation (p=0.0023), greater depth of cancer invasion (p=0. 003), the presence of lymph node metastasis (p=0.0014), vascular invasion by cancer cells (p< 0.0001), and poor prognosis (p< 0.0001), while cyclin D1 did not correlate with any of these except age (p=0.00193). Multivariate analysis revealed cyclin D2 overexpression to be an independent prognostic factor, in addition to depth of cancer invasion and lymph node status. Cdk4 overexpression was linked to cyclin D1, but not cyclin D2 overexpression. The results indicate that cyclin D2 up-regulation plays an important role in the progression and prognosis of gastric cancer independently of cdk4, whereas cyclin D1 overexpression does not.",cancer

In addition to angiogenesis inhibition, sunitinib appears to mediate antitumor immunity through effects on circulating monocytic cells. The current study investigated the effects of combined sunitinib and stereotactic radiotherapy on hematopoiesis. As part of a phase I/II clinical trial utilizing concurrent sunitinib (25-50 mg on days 1-28) and image-guided radiation therapy (40-50 Gy in 10 fractions starting on days 8-19) for patients with metastatic cancer, the complete blood count, platelet count and automatic differential were performed pretreatment and on days 8 and 19. On average, sunitinib monotherapy for 7 days resulted in a 33% decrease in monocytes and an 18% decrease in neutrophils (P<0.01 for all). Compared to sunitinib alone, combined sunitinib and radiation resulted in a further decrease in neutrophils, lymphocytes and platelets (P<0.05). Following sunitinib and radiation treatment, a greater than average decrease in monocytes (≥200/µl) was associated with a significant increase in progression-free and overall survival times. This exploratory study provides further evidence that monocytes represent a potential biomarker in patients with solid tumors treated with sunitinib.",nonCancer
610,Acquired resistance to crizotinib from a mutation in CD74-ROS1.,"Crizotinib, an inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), has also recently shown efficacy in the treatment of lung cancers with ROS1 translocations. Resistance to crizotinib developed in a patient with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma harboring a CD74-ROS1 rearrangement who had initially shown a dramatic response to treatment. We performed a biopsy of a resistant tumor and identified an acquired mutation leading to a glycine-to-arginine substitution at codon 2032 in the ROS1 kinase domain. Although this mutation does not lie at the gatekeeper residue, it confers resistance to ROS1 kinase inhibition through steric interference with drug binding. The same resistance mutation was observed at all the metastatic sites that were examined at autopsy, suggesting that this mutation was an early event in the clonal evolution of resistance.

The safety and efficacy of vemurafenib, irinotecan, and cetuximab in BRAF-mutated malignancies are not defined. In this 3+3 phase I study, patients with BRAF(V600E)-advanced solid cancers received cetuximab and irinotecan with escalating doses of vemurafenib. Nineteen patients (18 with metastatic colorectal cancer and 1 with appendiceal cancer) were enrolled. Three patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities. The MTD of vemurafenib was 960 mg twice daily. Six of 17 evaluable patients (35%) achieved a radiographic response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria, consistent with in vivo models demonstrating tumor regressions with the triplet regimen. Median progression-free survival was 7.7 months. BRAF(V600E) circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) trends correlated with radiographic changes, and acquired mutations from cfDNA in genes reactivating MAPK signaling were observed at progression. Vemurafenib, in combination with irinotecan and cetuximab, was well tolerated in patients with refractory, BRAF-mutated metastatic colorectal cancer, and both survival outcomes and response rates exceeded prior reports for vemurafenib and for irinotecan plus cetuximab in BRAF(V600E) metastatic colorectal cancer. In vivo models demonstrated regressions with the triplet, in contrast with vemurafenib and cetuximab alone. cfDNA predicted radiographic response and identified mutations reactivating the MAPK pathway upon progression.

691,KIT mutations and dose selection for imatinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours.,"A recent randomized EORTC phase III trial, comparing two doses of imatinib in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs), reported dose dependency for progression-free survival. The current analysis of that study aimed to assess if tumour mutational status correlates with clinical response to imatinib. Pre-treatment samples of GISTs from 377 patients enrolled in phase III study were analyzed for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA by combination of D-HPLC and direct sequencing of tumour genomic DNA. Mutation types were correlated with patients' survival data. The presence of exon 9-activating mutations in KIT was the strongest adverse prognostic factor for response to imatinib, increasing the relative risk of progression by 171% (P<0.0001) and the relative risk of death by 190% (P<0.0001) when compared with KIT exon 11 mutants. Similarly, the relative risk of progression was increased by 108% (P<0.0001) and the relative risk of death by 76% (P=0.028) in patients without detectable KIT or PDGFRA mutations. In patients whose tumours expressed an exon 9 KIT oncoprotein, treatment with the high-dose regimen resulted in a significantly superior progression-free survival (P=0.0013), with a reduction of the relative risk of 61%. We conclude that tumour genotype is of major prognostic significance for progression-free survival and overall survival in patients treated with imatinib for advanced GISTs. Our findings suggest the need for differential treatment of patients with GISTs, with KIT exon 9 mutant patients benefiting the most from the 800 mg daily dose of the drug.",cancer

The present study aimed to investigate the value of DTI in lumbosacral nerve root compression in patients with lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration. DTI was performed in 45 patients with lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values were measured in compressed and normal nerve roots. Fiber tracking imaging was also applied to observe the lumbosacral nerve roots. ADC value was significantly lower in the compressed group (1.314±0.14 mm(2)/sec) compared to in the uncompressed group (1.794±0.11 mm(2)/sec) (P<0.05). The FA value was significantly lower in the compressed group (0.196±0.020) compared to the uncompressed group (0.272±0.016) (P<0.05). DTI can evidently reveal the compressed nerve roots. DTI could be used to evaluate the lumbosacral nerve injury in patients with lumbar intervertebral disc degeneration to quantitatively assess nerve roots.",nonCancer
1535,Effect of polyelectrolyte multilayers assembled on ordered nanostructures on adhesion of human fibroblasts.,"Nanosphere lithography (NSL) and layer-by-layer (LbL) technique are combined here for the first time to design a flexible system to achieve nanotopographical control of cell adhesion. NSL is used to generate regular patterns of tetrahedral gold nanodots of different size and distance. Beside the change in topography, LbL is used to generate a polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) system consisting of heparin (HEP) and poly (ethylene imine) (PEI) on top of the gold dots. The localized formation of PEM on gold dots is achieved by prior passivation of the surrounding silicon or glass surface. Properties of PEM are changed by adjusting the pH value of HEP solution to either acidic or alkaline values. Studies with human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) reveal that cells spread to a higher extent on PEM formed at pH 5.0 in dependence on the structure dimension. Further, filopodia formation is highly increased in cells on nanostructures exhibiting HEP as terminal layer. The new system offers a great potential to guide stem cell differentiation in the future owing to its high degree of chemical and topographical heterogeneity.",nonCancer

2074,Adalimumab in Patients with Active Noninfectious Uveitis.,"Background Patients with noninfectious uveitis are at risk for long-term complications of uncontrolled inflammation, as well as for the adverse effects of long-term glucocorticoid therapy. We conducted a trial to assess the efficacy and safety of adalimumab as a glucocorticoid-sparing agent for the treatment of noninfectious uveitis. Methods This multinational phase 3 trial involved adults who had active noninfectious intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, or panuveitis despite having received prednisone treatment for 2 or more weeks. Investigators and patients were unaware of the study-group assignments. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive adalimumab (a loading dose of 80 mg followed by a dose of 40 mg every 2 weeks) or matched placebo. All patients received a mandatory prednisone burst followed by tapering of prednisone over the course of 15 weeks. The primary efficacy end point was the time to treatment failure occurring at or after week 6. Treatment failure was a multicomponent outcome that was based on assessment of new inflammatory lesions, best corrected visual acuity, anterior chamber cell grade, and vitreous haze grade. Nine ranked secondary efficacy end points were assessed, and adverse events were reported. Results The median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks in the adalimumab group and 13 weeks in the placebo group. Among the 217 patients in the intention-to-treat population, those receiving adalimumab were less likely than those in the placebo group to have treatment failure (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.70; P<0.001). Outcomes with regard to three secondary end points (change in anterior chamber cell grade, change in vitreous haze grade, and change in best corrected visual acuity) were significantly better in the adalimumab group than in the placebo group. Adverse events and serious adverse events were reported more frequently among patients who received adalimumab (1052.4 vs. 971.7 adverse events and 28.8 vs. 13.6 serious adverse events per 100 person-years). Conclusions In our trial, adalimumab was found to be associated with a lower risk of uveitic flare or visual impairment and with more adverse events and serious adverse events than was placebo.

1811,Grizzly Bear Noninvasive Genetic Tagging Surveys: Estimating the Magnitude of Missed Detections.,"Sound wildlife conservation decisions require sound information, and scientists increasingly rely on remotely collected data over large spatial scales, such as noninvasive genetic tagging (NGT). Grizzly bears (Ursus arctos), for example, are difficult to study at population scales except with noninvasive data, and NGT via hair trapping informs management over much of grizzly bears' range. Considerable statistical effort has gone into estimating sources of heterogeneity, but detection error-arising when a visiting bear fails to leave a hair sample-has not been independently estimated. We used camera traps to survey grizzly bear occurrence at fixed hair traps and multi-method hierarchical occupancy models to estimate the probability that a visiting bear actually leaves a hair sample with viable DNA. We surveyed grizzly bears via hair trapping and camera trapping for 8 monthly surveys at 50 (2012) and 76 (2013) sites in the Rocky Mountains of Alberta, Canada. We used multi-method occupancy models to estimate site occupancy, probability of detection, and conditional occupancy at a hair trap. We tested the prediction that detection error in NGT studies could be induced by temporal variability within season, leading to underestimation of occupancy. NGT via hair trapping consistently underestimated grizzly bear occupancy at a site when compared to camera trapping. At best occupancy was underestimated by 50%; at worst, by 95%. Probability of false absence was reduced through successive surveys, but this mainly accounts for error imparted by movement among repeated surveys, not necessarily missed detections by extant bears. The implications of missed detections and biased occupancy estimates for density estimation-which form the crux of management plans-require consideration. We suggest hair-trap NGT studies should estimate and correct detection error using independent survey methods such as cameras, to ensure the reliability of the data upon which species management and conservation actions are based.",nonCancer
2529,Exclusive breastfeeding among city-dwelling professional working mothers in Ghana.,"In Ghana, periodic national surveys report the practice of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) in the general population to be over 50 %. However, little is known about EBF among professional working mothers, particularly its duration after maternity leave. Female workers are entitled to 12 weeks (84 days) of maternity leave with full pay in Ghana, and this can be extended by two additional weeks in case of a caesarean or abnormal delivery. This study assessed the prevalence of EBF, as well as factors associated with the practice among professional working mothers in one of the ten regional capitals of Ghana.|The study was descriptive cross-sectional in design and employed a multi-stage sampling technique to sample 369 professional working mothers. The study was planned and implemented between January to July 2015. Study-specific structured questionnaires were used in the data collection over a period of one month. Some factors including demographic characteristics, types of facilities available at workplace to support breastfeeding, challenges to exclusive breastfeeding at the workplace and mother's knowledge base on EBF, were assessed. Exclusive breastfeeding is defined as feeding infants with only breast milk, without supplemental liquids or solids except for liquid medicine and vitamin or mineral supplements.|There was a near universal awareness of exclusive breastfeeding among respondents (99 %). Even though most mothers initiated breastfeeding within an hour of delivery (91 %), the EBF rate at six months was low (10.3 %). The study identified three elements as determinants of EBF; Those who did not receive infant feeding recommendation from health workers were less likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR] 0.45; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI] 0.27, 0.77), mothers who had shorter duration of maternity leave were less likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding (AOR 0.09; 95 % CI 0.02, 0.45), and those who had a normal delivery were almost 10 times as likely to practice exclusive breastfeeding (AOR 9.02; 95 % CI 2.85, 28.53).|Given the high breastfeeding initiation, but low EBF continuation rate among professional working mothers, improved policies around maternity leave and breastfeeding friendly work environments are needed.",nonCancer
389,Response to MET inhibitors in patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring MET mutations causing exon 14 skipping.,"Mutations in the MET exon 14 RNA splice acceptor and donor sites, which lead to exon skipping, deletion of the juxtamembrane domain containing the CBL E3-ubiquitin ligase-binding site, and decreased turnover of the resultant aberrant MET protein, were previously reported to be oncogenic in preclinical models. We now report responses to the MET inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib in four patients with stage IV lung adenocarcinomas harboring mutations leading to MET exon 14 skipping, highlighting a new therapeutic strategy for the 4% of lung adenocarcinoma patients whose tumors harbor this previously underappreciated genetic alteration. Oncogenic mutations in the MET exon 14 splice sites that cause exon 14 skipping occur in 4% of lung adenocarcinomas. We report responses to the MET inhibitors crizotinib and cabozantinib in patients with lung adenocarcinomas harboring MET exon 14 splice site mutations, identifying a new potential therapeutic target in this disease.",cancer
317,Impact of tumor HPV status on outcome in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving chemotherapy with or without cetuximab: retrospective analysis of the phase III EXTREME trial.,"Tumor human papillomavirus (HPV) status is an important prognostic factor in locoregionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Prognostic value in recurrent and/or metastatic (R/M) disease remains to be confirmed. This retrospective analysis of the EXTREME trial, comparing chemotherapy plus cetuximab with chemotherapy first line in R/M SCCHN, investigated efficacy and prognosis according to tumor p16 and HPV status. Paired tissue samples were used: p16INK4A expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and HPV status determined in extracted DNA samples using oligonucleotide hybridization assays. Altogether, 416 of 442 patients had tumor samples available for p16 and HPV: 10% of tumors were p16 positive and 5% were HPV positive. Adding cetuximab to chemotherapy improved survival, irrespective of tumor p16 or HPV status. This pattern remained in a combined analysis of p16 and HPV. p16 positivity and HPV positivity were associated with prolonged survival compared with p16 negativity and HPV negativity. Subgroup analysis of patients with oropharyngeal cancer demonstrated a similar pattern to all evaluable patients. The results from this analysis suggest that p16 and HPV status have prognostic value in R/M SCCHN and survival benefits of chemotherapy plus cetuximab over chemotherapy alone are independent of tumor p16 and HPV status.",cancer
1220,Genomic and biological characterization of exon 4 KRAS mutations in human cancer.,"Mutations in RAS proteins occur widely in human cancer. Prompted by the confirmation of KRAS mutation as a predictive biomarker of response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies, limited clinical testing for RAS pathway mutations has recently been adopted. We performed a multiplatform genomic analysis to characterize, in a nonbiased manner, the biological, biochemical, and prognostic significance of Ras pathway alterations in colorectal tumors and other solid tumor malignancies. Mutations in exon 4 of KRAS were found to occur commonly and to predict for a more favorable clinical outcome in patients with colorectal cancer. Exon 4 KRAS mutations, all of which were identified at amino acid residues K117 and A146, were associated with lower levels of GTP-bound RAS in isogenic models. These same mutations were also often accompanied by conversion to homozygosity and increased gene copy number, in human tumors and tumor cell lines. Models harboring exon 4 KRAS mutations exhibited mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase dependence and resistance to EGFR-targeted agents. Our findings suggest that RAS mutation is not a binary variable in tumors, and that the diversity in mutant alleles and variability in gene copy number may also contribute to the heterogeneity of clinical outcomes observed in cancer patients. These results also provide a rationale for broader KRAS testing beyond the most common hotspot alleles in exons 2 and 3.",cancer
1387,Clinical Considerations Regarding Regression in Psychotherapy with Patients with Conversion Disorder.,"Regression is a ubiquitous phenomenon in psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, typically part of a reorganization that leads to progression, at least with respect to recruiting elements in the unconscious to consciousness. Regression in patients with conversion disorder (i.e., pseudo-neurological symptoms without an organic basis) is often itself somatic/physical rather than psychic in nature. Psychotherapists working with these patients must be prepared for confusing or frightening forms of regression that should be expected as part of the therapeutic process. In conversion disorder patients with adequate character structure, this regression, when handled effectively by the psychotherapist, ultimately leads to verbalized thoughts and feelings and a gradually strengthening alternative to physically experienced psychic conflict.",nonCancer
407,Decreased peritherapeutic VEGF expression could be a predictor of responsiveness to first-line FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab in mCRC patients.,"Bevacizumab is the only anti-angiogenic agent approved in first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Although chemotherapy plus bevacizumab has led to improve outcomes for mCRC patients and is a common choice for first-line treatment of mCRC, previous research has established no prominent biomarker that can help to select patients who may benefit from bevacizumab in order to improve cost-effectiveness and therapeutic outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare pre- and post-therapeutic VEGF immunohistochemical (IHC) expression in mCRC patients treated with FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab to identify its potential role as a predictive biomarker. A total of 57 mCRC patients who underwent FOLFIRI combined with bevacizumab chemotherapy as a first-line neoadjuvant regimen were enrolled and clinical outcome data analyzed. Low post-therapeutic VEGF expression (P < 0.001) and decreased peri-therapeutic VEGF expression (P < 0.001) were significantly predictive factors of responders. Furthermore, the 6-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate in mCRC patients with decreased peri-therapeutic VEGF expression was significantly better than the rate for those patients with no peri-therapeutic VEGF expression alterations (P = 0.033). Decreased peri-therapeutic VEGF expression in mCRC patients could probably be used to predict responsiveness to bevacizumab and subsequent PFS in clinical practice.",cancer
1596,Does the combination of biochar and clinoptilolite enhance nutrient recovery from the liquid fraction of biogas digestate?,"Concentrating nutrients on sorbents such as biochar and clinoptilolite and subsequently using the nutrient-enriched sorbents as a fertiliser could be an alternative way to manage nutrients in the liquid fraction of digestate. In this study, we investigated the use of biochar and clinoptilolite columns in removing ammonium, potassium, orthophosphate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from the liquid fraction of digestate. Our objectives were to investigate the effect of the initial loading ratio between liquid and biochar on nutrient removal, and to investigate the effect of combining biochar with clinoptilolite on nutrient and DOC removal efficiency. Increasing the initial loading ratios increased nutrient concentrations on biochar to 8.61 mg NH4-N g(-1), 1.95 mg PO4-P g(-1) and 13.01 mg DOC g(-1). However, an increase in the initial loading ratio resulted in decreasing removal efficiencies. Potassium removal was not possible since biochar released potassium into the liquid fraction of digestate. The combination of biochar and clinoptilolite resulted in improved ammonium, potassium and DOC removal efficiencies compared to biochar alone, but did not significantly change PO4-P removal efficiencies. Removal efficiencies with combined sorbents were up to 67% for ammonium, 58% for DOC and 58% for potassium. Clinoptilolite alone showed higher removal efficiencies compared to biochar alone, and combining clinoptilolite with biochar only improved total P removal efficiency. Nutrient removal from the liquid fraction of digestate with clinoptilolite and biochar may be an option for concentrating nutrients from the liquid fraction of digestate when both sorbents are available at a low cost.",nonCancer
77,CEBPA mutations in younger adults with acute myeloid leukemia and normal cytogenetics: prognostic relevance and analysis of cooperating mutations.,"To assess the prognostic relevance of mutations in the CEBPA gene encoding CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP alpha) in a large prospective series of younger adults with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and normal cytogenetics. The entire CEBPA coding region was sequenced in diagnostic samples from 236 AML patients 16 to 60 years of age with normal cytogenetics who were uniformly treated on two consecutive protocols of the AML Study Group Ulm, and CEBPA mutation status was correlated with clinical outcome. CEBPA mutations were detected in 36 (15%) of 236 patients. Twenty-one (9%) of 236 patients had mutations predicted to result in loss of C/EBP alpha function. Remission duration and overall survival (OS) were significantly longer for the 36 patients with CEBPA mutations (P =.01 and P =.05, respectively). On multivariate analysis, wild-type CEBPA was an independent prognostic marker affecting remission duration (hazard ratio, 2.85; P =.01) and OS (hazard ratio, 1.87; P =.04). Analysis of cooperating mutations (both types of activating FLT3 mutations and MLL partial tandem duplications) showed that FLT3 mutations had no significant prognostic influence in patients with CEBPA mutations. Furthermore, there was no significant overlap between the subgroup of patients with CEBPA mutation with predicted loss of C/EBP alpha function and patients with FLT3 or MLL mutations, suggesting that CEBPA loss-of-function mutations define a distinct biologic subclass of AML with normal cytogenetics. Mutant CEBPA predicts favorable prognosis and may improve risk stratification in AML patients with normal cytogenetics.",cancer
1876,Physical Symptoms at the Time of Dying Was Diagnosed: A Consecutive Cohort Study To Describe the Prevalence and Intensity of Problems Experienced by Imminently Dying Palliative Care Patients by Diagnosis and Place of Care.,"The aim of this work was to analyze routine assessments recorded, when a patient was documented as likely to die in hours to days, to determine the prevalence, intensity, and associations of physical symptoms.|Although death inevitably occurs, very little prospective data describe at population level the physical symptoms confronting imminently dying people.|Using prospectively collected data from participating palliative care services in the Australian Palliative Care Outcomes Collaboration between July 1, 2013, and December 31, 2014, factors associated with worse symptom experiences were explored using logistic regression modeling.|The experiences of 18,975 patients who died after being identified as imminently terminal were analyzed, with 75% (n = 14,238) of these being cancer deaths. Seventy percent (n = 13,051) occurred in a palliative care unit, 8.7% (n = 1657) in an acute hospital with palliative care support, and 22.5% (n = 4266) at home. More than half were assessed as experiencing acceptable symptom control especially those with nonmalignant disease. The notable exception was breathing problems, where compared to cancer patients, those with nonmalignant disease were 34% more likely to experience distressing breathlessness (odds ratio 1.34; 95% confidence interval 1.23-147). Regardless of the cause, deaths in a community setting were more likely to be complicated by more severe symptoms with the exception of breathlessness, where those dying in acute hospitals were most likely to be assessed as requiring further help.|The terminal phase is perceived as a time where the majority will experience distressing symptoms, but this work suggests a contrary view. However, there did seem to be a detrimental effect depending on place of care with more significant problems recorded when people were dying at home. More work is needed to clarify this given the current push for more home deaths.",nonCancer
165,CDKN2A (p16) promoter hypermethylation influences the outcome in young lung cancer patients.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) occurs most frequently in individuals older than 60 years of age. Currently, no biological indicators associated with NSCLC in younger patients (30 to 60 y) have been identified. To explore epigenetic influences, promoter methylation of selected tumor suppressor genes was analyzed in early-stage NSCLC patients ranging in age from 30 to 87 years at diagnosis. The analysis was performed on formalin-fixed tumor tissue from 193 surgically treated NSCLC patients (127, older than 60 y; 66, 60 y and younger). Methylation was quantified in p16, MGMT, DAPK, RASSF1, CDH1, LET7-3-a, NORE1(RASSF5), and PTEN promoters by pyrosequencing. p16 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Outcome, defined by time to recurrence and overall survival, was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Promoter methylation levels were generally higher in patients older than 60 years of age than in patients 60 years or younger at diagnosis. Of the genes tested, methylation levels of the p16 promoter showed age-related differences. Although p16 promoter methylation was significantly lower using cut-points of 50 years or younger and 40 years or younger (P=0.001 to 0.012, respectively), p16 protein expression increased with age. Patients 60 years or younger with p16 promoter hypermethylation had a significantly shortened time to recurrence (P=0.002) and a shortened survival time (P=0.011). No effect of p16 hypermethylation was seen in patients older than 60 years. p16 promoter hypermethylation was associated with a worse outcome in patients with age at diagnosis of 60 years or younger, but was not associated with the outcome in the older than 60-year age group. Overall, these data support methylation-dependent and methylation-independent age-related regulation of p16 expression with differential effects on the outcome after surgical resection for early-stage NSCLC.",cancer
705,"Cytoreductive antitumor activity of PF-2341066, a novel inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase and c-Met, in experimental models of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.","A t(2;5) chromosomal translocation resulting in expression of an oncogenic kinase fusion protein known as nucleophosmin-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (NPM-ALK) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL). PF-2341066 was recently identified as a p.o. bioavailable, small-molecule inhibitor of the catalytic activity of c-Met kinase and the NPM-ALK fusion protein. PF-2341066 also potently inhibited NPM-ALK phosphorylation in Karpas299 or SU-DHL-1 ALCL cells (mean IC(50) value, 24 nmol/L). In biochemical and cellular screens, PF-2341066 was shown to be selective for c-Met and ALK at pharmacologically relevant concentrations across a panel of >120 diverse kinases. PF-2341066 potently inhibited cell proliferation, which was associated with G(1)-S-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis in ALK-positive ALCL cells (IC(50) values, approximately 30 nmol/L) but not ALK-negative lymphoma cells. The induction of apoptosis was confirmed using terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated nick-end labeling and Annexin V staining (IC(50) values, 25-50 nmol/L). P.o. administration of PF-2341066 to severe combined immunodeficient-Beige mice bearing Karpas299 ALCL tumor xenografts resulted in dose-dependent antitumor efficacy with complete regression of all tumors at the 100 mg/kg/d dose within 15 days of initial compound administration. A strong correlation was observed between antitumor response and inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis in tumor tissue. In addition, inhibition of key NPM-ALK signaling mediators, including phospholipase C-gamma, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, extracellular signal-regulated kinases, and Akt by PF-2341066 were observed at concentrations or dose levels, which correlated with inhibition of NPM-ALK phosphorylation and function. Collectively, these data illustrate the potential clinical utility of inhibitors of NPM-ALK in treatment of patients with ALK-positive ALCL.",cancer
2486,miR-143 suppresses the proliferation of NSCLC cells by inhibiting the epidermal growth factor receptor.,"MicroRNAs (miRs) regulate the proliferation and metastasis of numerous cancer cell types. It was previously reported that miR-143 levels were downregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and cell lines, and that the migration and invasion of NSCLC cells was inhibited upon suppression of cell proliferation and colony formation by the upregulation of miR-143. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a vital factor in the promotion of cancer cell proliferation and has been investigated as a potential focus in cancer therapy, has been reported to be a possible target of miR-143. The present study aimed to investigate the role of miR-143 in NSCLC using NSCLC cell lines and primary cells from NSCLC patients. NSCLC cells were co-transfected with EGFR and miR-143, and the mRNA and protein expression of EGFR were analyzed. Furthermore, the activity of the transfected cancer cells with regard to colony formation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were evaluated. The levels of miR-143 were decreased in the NSCLC cell lines and primary cells from patients with NSCLC compared with the controls. Following transfection with miR-143, the ability of NSCLC cells to proliferate, form colonies, migrate and invade was inhibited. Similarly, knockdown of EGFR led to the suppression of NSCLC cell proliferation. The mRNA and protein expression levels of EGFR were significantly reduced following miR-143 overexpression, and the level of miR-143 was inversely correlated with that of EGFR in NSCLC cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that miR-143 was able to suppress NSCLC cell proliferation and invasion by inhibiting the effects of EGFR, suggesting that EGFR may be considered a potential target for NSCLC therapy.",nonCancer

Regarding puberty, adiponectin trended downward in late puberty but only males were significantly lower in adulthood. By sex, adiponectin was lower in adult males vs. females of both ethnicities. Regarding ethnicity, Hispanic adults of both sexes had lower adiponectin than NHW adults. Of note, in NHW females, adiponectin trended highest in adulthood, whereas in Hispanic females, adiponectin fell in late-puberty and remained lower in adulthood.|Adiponectin inversely correlated with IR, trended down in late puberty, and was lowest in adult males. Hispanic adults of both sexes had lower adiponectin than NHW adults and Hispanic females followed a more ""male"" pattern, lacking the rebound in adiponectin seen in NHW females after puberty. These data suggest that adiponectin, independent of BMI, may relate to the greater cardiometabolic risk seen in Hispanic populations and in particular Hispanic females.",nonCancer
1115,GNAS1 T393C polymorphism is associated with clinical course in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.,"The GNAS1 locus encodes the Galphas protein, which stimulates the formation of cyclo-adenosinemonophosphate (cAMP). The cAMP pathway mediates pleiotropic effects, including the regulation of apoptosis and proliferation. We have recently shown that TT genotypes of the single-nucleotide polymorphism T393C in the gene GNAS1 predict the clinical outcome of patients with various carcinomas. Eighty-seven patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) were retrospectively genotyped to elucidate a potential association between T393C genotypes and clinical outcome. ICCs of patients with homozygous TT genotypes revealed a higher proliferation rate and a lower apoptotic rate. Homozygous TT patients were at highest risk for cancer-related deaths (hazard ratio = 2.74; 95% confidence interval = 1.03-7.28) compared with C-allele carriers. Kaplan-Meier curves for disease-specific overall and local recurrence-free survival in a subgroup with R(0)-resected ICC showed a significant association of T393 homozygosity with outcome, which was confirmed in multivariate Cox regression analysis. GNAS1 T393C is a novel independent host factor for disease progression in patients with ICC. Our finding that TT homozygosity (and not CC homozygosity) was associated with unfavorable clinical outcome points to the complex and differing functional effects induced by GNAS1 T393C polymorphism in various human carcinomas.",cancer
283,Highly prevalent TERT promoter mutations in aggressive thyroid cancers.,"Mutations 1 295 228 C>T and 1 295 250 C>T (termed C228T and C250T respectively), corresponding to -124 C>T and -146 C>T from the translation start site in the promoter of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene, have recently been reported in human cancers, but not in thyroid cancers yet. We explored these mutations in thyroid cancers by genomic sequencing of a large number of primary tumor samples. We found the C228T mutation in 0 of 85 (0.0%) benign thyroid tumors, 30 of 257 (11.7%) papillary thyroid cancers (PTC), 9 of 79 (11.4%) follicular thyroid cancers (FTC), 3 of 8 (37.5%) poorly differentiated thyroid cancers (PDTC), 23 of 54 (42.6%) anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC), and 8 of 12 (66.7%) thyroid cancer cell lines. The C250T mutation was uncommon, but mutually exclusive with the C228T mutation, and the two mutations were collectively found in 11 of 79 (13.9%) FTC, 25 of 54 (46.3%) ATC, and 11 of 12 (91.7%) thyroid cancer cell lines. Among PTC variants, the C228T mutation was found in 4 of 13 (30.8%) tall-cell PTC (TCPTC), 23 of 187 (12.3%) conventional PTC, and 2 of 56 (3.6%) follicular variant PTC samples. No TERT mutation was found in 16 medullary thyroid cancer samples. The C228T mutation was associated with the BRAF V600E mutation in PTC, being present in 19 of 104 (18.3%) BRAF mutation-positive PTC vs 11 of 153 (7.2%) the BRAF mutation-negative PTC samples (P=0.0094). Conversely, BRAF mutation was found in 19 of 30 (63.3%) C228T mutation-positive PTC vs 85 of 227 (37.4%) C228T mutation-negative PTC samples (P=0.0094). We thus for the first time, to our knowledge, demonstrate TERT promoter mutations in thyroid cancers, that are particularly prevalent in the aggressive thyroid cancers TCPTC, PDTC, ATC and BRAF mutation-positive PTC, revealing a novel genetic background for thyroid cancers.",cancer
356,Vismodegib Exerts Targeted Efficacy Against Recurrent Sonic Hedgehog-Subgroup Medulloblastoma: Results From Phase II Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium Studies PBTC-025B and PBTC-032.,"Two phase II studies assessed the efficacy of vismodegib, a sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathway inhibitor that binds smoothened (SMO), in pediatric and adult recurrent medulloblastoma (MB). Adult patients enrolled onto PBTC-025B and pediatric patients enrolled onto PBTC-032 were treated with vismodegib (150 to 300 mg/d). Protocol-defined response, which had to be sustained for 8 weeks, was confirmed by central neuroimaging review. Molecular tests to identify patterns of response and insensitivity were performed when tissue was available. A total of 31 patients were enrolled onto PBTC-025B, and 12 were enrolled onto PBTC-032. Three patients in PBTC-025B and one in PBTC-032, all with SHH-subgroup MB (SHH-MB), exhibited protocol-defined responses. Progression-free survival (PFS) was longer in those with SHH-MB than in those with non-SHH-MB, and prolonged disease stabilization occurred in 41% of patient cases of SHH-MB. Among those with SHH-MB, loss of heterozygosity of PTCH1 was associated with prolonged PFS, and diffuse staining of P53 was associated with reduced PFS. Whole-exome sequencing identified mutations in SHH genes downstream from SMO in four of four tissue samples from nonresponders and upstream of SMO in two of four patients with favorable responses. Vismodegib exhibits activity against adult recurrent SHH-MB but not against recurrent non-SHH-MB. Inadequate accrual of pediatric patients precluded conclusions in this population. Molecular analyses support the hypothesis that SMO inhibitor activity depends on the genomic aberrations within the tumor. Such inhibitors should be advanced in SHH-MB studies; however, molecular and genomic work remains imperative to identify target populations that will truly benefit.",cancer
922,ATRX loss promotes tumor growth and impairs nonhomologous end joining DNA repair in glioma.,"Recent work in human glioblastoma (GBM) has documented recurrent mutations in the histone chaperone protein ATRX. We developed an animal model of ATRX-deficient GBM and showed that loss of ATRX reduces median survival and increases genetic instability. Further, analysis of genome-wide data for human gliomas showed that ATRX mutation is associated with increased mutation rate at the single-nucleotide variant (SNV) level. In mouse tumors, ATRX deficiency impairs nonhomologous end joining and increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents that induce double-stranded DNA breaks. We propose that ATRX loss results in a genetically unstable tumor, which is more aggressive when left untreated but is more responsive to double-stranded DNA-damaging agents, resulting in improved overall survival.",cancer
81,Mutations and treatment outcome in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.,"Mutations occur in several genes in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells: the nucleophosmin gene (NPM1), the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3), the CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha gene (CEPBA), the myeloid-lymphoid or mixed-lineage leukemia gene (MLL), and the neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS). We evaluated the associations of these mutations with clinical outcomes in patients. We compared the mutational status of the NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, MLL, and NRAS genes in leukemia cells with the clinical outcome in 872 adults younger than 60 years of age with cytogenetically normal AML. Patients had been entered into one of four trials of therapy for AML. In each study, patients with an HLA-matched related donor were assigned to undergo stem-cell transplantation. A total of 53% of patients had NPM1 mutations, 31% had FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs), 11% had FLT3 tyrosine kinase-domain mutations, 13% had CEBPA mutations, 7% had MLL partial tandem duplications (PTDs), and 13% had NRAS mutations. The overall complete-remission rate was 77%. The genotype of mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD, the mutant CEBPA genotype, and younger age were each significantly associated with complete remission. Of the 663 patients who received postremission therapy, 150 underwent hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation from an HLA-matched related donor. Significant associations were found between the risk of relapse or the risk of death during complete remission and the leukemia genotype of mutant NPM1 without FLT3-ITD (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.32 to 0.61), the mutant CEBPA genotype (hazard ratio, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.75), and the MLL-PTD genotype (hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.00 to 2.43), as well as receipt of a transplant from an HLA-matched related donor (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.82). The benefit of the transplant was limited to the subgroup of patients with the prognostically adverse genotype FLT3-ITD or the genotype consisting of wild-type NPM1 and CEBPA without FLT3-ITD. Genotypes defined by the mutational status of NPM1, FLT3, CEBPA, and MLL are associated with the outcome of treatment for patients with cytogenetically normal AML.",cancer
148,KIT mutations are common in incidental gastrointestinal stromal tumors one centimeter or less in size.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal neoplasms of the gut wall that express the receptor tyrosine kinase KIT. Somatic mutations that result in constitutive activation of KIT kinase have been identified in a number of studies of GISTs, although the reported frequency of these mutations has varied over a wide range (20 to 92%). Several reports have suggested that KIT gene mutations are more common in malignant GISTs than in benign lesions, and it has been proposed that mutations in exon 11 of KIT are a negative prognostic factor. To maximize sensitivity for KIT mutations we have adapted denaturing high-pressure liquid chromatography as a method for screening polymerase chain reaction amplimers of exons 9, 11, 13, and 17 from GIST genomic DNA. This approach was used to assess the frequency of KIT mutations in 13 morphologically benign, incidentally discovered, GISTs identified at autopsy, endoscopy, or laparotomy for unrelated disease. Representing the smallest pathologically recognizable GISTs, these lesions ranged in size from 4 to 10 mm in diameter and were all immunohistochemically positive for KIT. Eleven of the 13 tumors had sequence-confirmed mutations in KIT, including 10 mutations in exon 11 (77%) and one mutation in exon 9 (7.7%). The remaining two tumors were wild type for exons 9, 11, and 17; one of these was also analyzed for exon 13 and was wild type in this exon as well. The mutations found in the incidental GISTs were identical to those that have been documented in larger GISTs. In addition, the overall frequency of mutations in the incidental tumors (85%) did not differ significantly from that we previously reported in a series of 72 advanced/metastatic GISTs (86%), strongly supporting the view that activating mutations in KIT are acquired very early in the development of most GISTs. The findings suggest that KIT mutations per se are of little prognostic importance in GISTs.",cancer
179,Molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma arise by distinct genetic pathways.,"Gene-expression profiling has been used to define 3 molecular subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), termed germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL, activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL, and primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBL). To investigate whether these DLBCL subtypes arise by distinct pathogenetic mechanisms, we analyzed 203 DLBCL biopsy samples by high-resolution, genome-wide copy number analysis coupled with gene-expression profiling. Of 272 recurrent chromosomal aberrations that were associated with gene-expression alterations, 30 were used differentially by the DLBCL subtypes (P < 0.006). An amplicon on chromosome 19 was detected in 26% of ABC DLBCLs but in only 3% of GCB DLBCLs and PMBLs. A highly up-regulated gene in this amplicon was SPIB, which encodes an ETS family transcription factor. Knockdown of SPIB by RNA interference was toxic to ABC DLBCL cell lines but not to GCB DLBCL, PMBL, or myeloma cell lines, strongly implicating SPIB as an oncogene involved in the pathogenesis of ABC DLBCL. Deletion of the INK4a/ARF tumor suppressor locus and trisomy 3 also occurred almost exclusively in ABC DLBCLs and was associated with inferior outcome within this subtype. FOXP1 emerged as a potential oncogene in ABC DLBCL that was up-regulated by trisomy 3 and by more focal high-level amplifications. In GCB DLBCL, amplification of the oncogenic mir-17-92 microRNA cluster and deletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN were recurrent, but these events did not occur in ABC DLBCL. Together, these data provide genetic evidence that the DLBCL subtypes are distinct diseases that use different oncogenic pathways.",cancer
221,Increased epidermal growth factor receptor gene copy number is associated with poor prognosis in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.,"High epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number is associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer, but such findings have not been reported for HNSCC. A better understanding of the EGFR pathway may improve the use of EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC. EGFR status was analyzed in 86 tumor samples from 82 HNSCC patients by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to determine EGFR gene copy number, by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing for activating mutations, and by DNA microarray and immunohistochemistry for RNA and protein expression. The results were associated with patient characteristics and clinical end points. Forty-three (58%) of 75 samples with FISH results demonstrated EGFR high polysomy and/or gene amplification (FISH positive). The FISH-positive group did not differ from the FISH-negative group with respect to age, sex, race, tumor grade, subsites and stage, or EGFR expression by analyses of RNA or protein. No activating EGFR mutations were found. However, the FISH-positive group was associated with worse progression-free and overall survival (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively; log-rank test). When microarray data were interrogated using the FISH results as a supervising parameter, ECop (which is known to coamplify with EGFR and regulate nuclear factor-kappa B transcriptional activity) had higher expression in FISH-positive tumors. High EGFR gene copy number by FISH is frequent in HNSCC and is a poor prognostic indicator. Additional investigation is indicated to determine the biologic significance and implications for EGFR inhibitor therapies in HNSCC.",cancer
398,Loss-of-Function PTPRD Mutations Lead to Increased STAT3 Activation and Sensitivity to STAT3 Inhibition in Head and Neck Cancer.,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) is a putative tumor suppressor in several cancers including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). STAT3 is a frequently hyperactivated oncogene in HNSCC. As STAT3 is a direct substrate of PTPRD, we sought to determine the genetic or epigenetic alterations of PTPRD that contribute to overactive STAT3 in HNSCC. We analyzed data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and our previous whole-exome sequencing study and summarized the mutation, methylation, and copy number status of PTPRD in HNSCC and other cancers. In vitro studies involved standard transfection and MTT protocols, as well as methylation-specific PCR. Our findings indicate that PTPRD mutation, rather than methylation or copy number alteration, is the primary mechanism by which PTPRD function is lost in HNSCC. We demonstrate that overexpression of wild-type PTPRD in HNSCC cells significantly inhibits growth and STAT3 activation while PTPRD mutants do not, suggesting that mutation may lead to loss of function and subsequent hyper-phosphorylation of PTPRD substrates, especially STAT3. Importantly, we determined that HNSCC cells harboring an endogenous PTPRD mutation are more sensitive to STAT3 blockade than PTPRD wild-type cells. We additionally found that PTPRD mRNA expression does not correlate with pSTAT3 expression, suggesting that alterations that manifest through altered mRNA expression, including hypermethylation and gene copy number alterations, do not significantly contribute to STAT3 overactivation in HNSCC. PTPRD mutation, but not methylation or copy number loss, may serve as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity to STAT3 inhibitors in HNSCC.",cancer

961,FGF2 from Marrow Microenvironment Promotes Resistance to FLT3 Inhibitors in Acute Myeloid Leukemia.,"Potent FLT3 inhibitors, such as quizartinib (AC220), have shown promise in treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) containing FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations. However, responses are not durable and resistance develops within months. In this study, we outline a two-step model of resistance whereby extrinsic microenvironmental proteins FLT3 ligand (FL) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) protect FLT3-ITD+ MOLM14 cells from AC220, providing time for subsequent accumulation of ligand-independent resistance mechanisms. FL directly attenuated AC220 inhibition of FLT3, consistent with previous reports. Conversely, FGF2 promoted resistance through activation of FGFR1 and downstream MAPK effectors; these resistant cells responded synergistically to combinatorial inhibition of FGFR1 and FLT3. Removing FL or FGF2 from ligand-dependent resistant cultures transiently restored sensitivity to AC220, but accelerated acquisition of secondary resistance via reactivation of FLT3 and RAS/MAPK signaling. FLT3-ITD AML patients treated with AC220 developed increased FGF2 expression in marrow stromal cells, which peaked prior to overt clinical relapse and detection of resistance mutations. Overall, these results support a strategy of early combination therapy to target early survival signals from the bone marrow microenvironment, in particular FGF2, to improve the depth of response in FLT3-ITD AML.

493,Phase II study of everolimus with biomarker exploration in patients with advanced gastric cancer refractory to chemotherapy including fluoropyrimidine and platinum.,"To evaluate the activity and safety of everolimus and identify potential biomarkers for efficacy of everolimus in patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC), who failed both fluoropyrimidine and platinum. Fifty-four patients received everolimus (10 mg day(-1)). The primary objective was to determine the 4-month progression-free survival (PFS) rate, assumed to be 30%. We additionally investigated the potential biomarkers for everolimus as an exploratory endpoint in those who underwent tumour biopsies. Two patients (3.7%) achieved partial response and the disease control rate (DCR) was 38.9%. At a median follow-up duration of 8.7 months, the 4-month PFS rate was 18.4%, not fulfilling the primary hypothesis, with a median PFS of 1.7 months and a median overall survival of 8.3 months. The high expression of pS6(Ser240/4) at baseline was significantly associated with higher DCR (P=0.043) and prolonged PFS (P=0.001). Grade 1/2 asthenia (96.3%) recorded as the leading toxicity and hyperglycaemia (20.4%) was the most common non-hematological grade 3/4 toxicity. Three patients experienced grade 3/4 pneumonitis. Notably, two experienced treatment-related deaths. Everolimus is active against a limited number of patients with AGC. pS6(Ser240/4) may be a potential predictive biomarker for everolimus, which requires validation. Careful monitoring is necessary despite generally favourable toxicity profile.",cancer
1827,Binding of Pollutants to Biomolecules - A Simulation Study.,"A number of cases around the world have been reported where animals were found dead or dying with symptoms resembling a Thiamine (vitamin B) deficiency and for some of these a link to pollutants has been suggested. Here we investigate whether biomolecules involved in Thiamin binding and transport could be blocked by a range of different pollutants. We used in silico docking of five compound classes (25 compounds in total) to each of five tar- gets (Prion protein, ECF-type ABC transporter, Thi-box Riboswitch receptor, Thiamin py- rophosphokinase, and YKoF protein) and subsequently performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to assess the stability of the complexes. The compound classes were Thiamin ana- logues (control), pesticides, veterinary medicines, polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins, all of which are prevalent in the environment to some extent. A few anthropogenic compounds were found to bind the the ECF-type ABC transporter but none binds stably to the Prion pro- tein. For the Riboswitch most compounds remained in their binding pockets during 50 ns of MD simulation indicating the RNA provides a promiscuous binding site. In both the YKoF and Thiamin pyrophosphokinase (TPK), most compounds remain tightly bound. However, the TPK biomolecules undergo pollutant-induced conformational changes. Although most com- pounds are found to bind to some of these targets, a larger dataset is needed along with more quantitative methods like free energy perturbation calculations before firm conclusions can be drawn. This study is in part a test bed for large-scale quantitative computational screening of interactions between biological entities and pollutant molecules.",nonCancer
1874,Characterization of Intestinal Microbiomes of Hirschsprung's Disease Patients with or without Enterocolitis Using Illumina-MiSeq High-Throughput Sequencing.,"Hirschsprung-associated enterocolitis (HAEC) is a life-threatening complication of Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Although the pathological mechanisms are still unclear, studies have shown that HAEC has a close relationship with the disturbance of intestinal microbiota. This study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the intestinal microbiome of HD patients with or without enterocolitis. During routine or emergency surgery, we collected 35 intestinal content samples from five patients with HAEC and eight HD patients, including three HD patients with a history of enterocolitis who were in a HAEC remission (HAEC-R) phase. Using Illumina-MiSeq high-throughput sequencing, we sequenced the V4 region of bacterial 16S rRNA, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were defined by 97% sequence similarity. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) of weighted UniFrac distances was performed to evaluate the diversity of each intestinal microbiome sample. The microbiota differed significantly between the HD patients (characterized by the prevalence of Bacteroidetes) and HAEC patients (characterized by the prevalence of Proteobacteria), while the microbiota of the HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of the HAEC patients. We also observed that the specimens from different intestinal sites of each HD patient differed significantly, while the specimens from different intestinal sites of each HAEC and HAEC-R patient were more similar. In conclusion, the microbiome pattern of the HAEC-R patients was more similar to that of the HAEC patients than to that of the HD patients. The HD patients had a relatively distinct, more stable community than the HAEC and HAEC-R patients, suggesting that enterocolitis may either be caused by or result in a disruption of the patient's uniquely adapted intestinal flora. The intestinal microbiota associated with enterocolitis may persist following symptom resolution and can be implicated in the symptom recurrence.",nonCancer
1252,Clinical Acquired Resistance to RAF Inhibitor Combinations in BRAF-Mutant Colorectal Cancer through MAPK Pathway Alterations.,"BRAF mutations occur in approximately 10% of colorectal cancers. Although RAF inhibitor monotherapy is highly effective in BRAF-mutant melanoma, response rates in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer are poor. Recent clinical trials of combined RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK inhibition have produced improved efficacy, but patients ultimately develop resistance. To identify molecular alterations driving clinical acquired resistance, we performed whole-exome sequencing on paired pretreatment and postprogression tumor biopsies from patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer treated with RAF inhibitor combinations. We identified alterations in MAPK pathway genes in resistant tumors not present in matched pretreatment tumors, including KRAS amplification, BRAF amplification, and a MEK1 mutation. These alterations conferred resistance to RAF/EGFR or RAF/MEK combinations through sustained MAPK pathway activity, but an ERK inhibitor could suppress MAPK activity and overcome resistance. Identification of MAPK pathway reactivating alterations upon clinical acquired resistance underscores the MAPK pathway as a critical target in BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer and suggests therapeutic options to overcome resistance. RAF inhibitor combinations represent promising approaches in clinical development for BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer. Initial characterization of clinical acquired resistance mechanisms to these regimens identified several MAPK pathway alterations driving resistance by reactivating MAPK signaling, highlighting the critical dependence of BRAF-mutant colorectal cancers on MAPK signaling and offering potential strategies to overcome resistance.",cancer

As these are heterogeneous conditions and often with rare occurrence, it is difficult to compare them in a single study. We aimed to assess reoperation events after fusion for several etiologies of pediatric scoliosis.|The 2008 to 2011 New York State Inpatient Database was queried using International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9-CM) codes for patients with in-hospital stays including a spine arthrodesis for scoliosis. All approaches, all fusion lengths, and ages 10 to 21 were included. Patient identifiers and linkage variables were used to identify revisits. The relative risk of reoperation was calculated for several rare conditions associated with scoliosis.|Two thousand three hundred fifty-six pediatric scoliosis fusion surgeries were identified in 2008 in the state of New York. The 1- and 4-year reoperation rate for idiopathic scoliosis was 0.9% and 1.6%, respectively. For nonidiopathic scoliosis, the 1- and 4-year rates were 4.2% and 20.4%, respectively. Of the nonidiopathic scoliosis subtypes, congenital scoliosis (4.7% risk at 1 y, 41.6% at 4 y), the neuromuscular disease arthrogryposis (7.3% risk at 1 y, 28.6% at 4 y), and syndrome neurofibromatosis (9.1% at 1 y, 32.3% at 4 y) showed the highest risk for reoperation. Length of stay and hospital charges were higher for reoperations.|Using a large administrative database, we identified neuromuscular, syndromic, and congenital forms of scoliosis that have the highest relative risk for a reoperation within 1 year.

2506,Candida albicans triggers the expression of inflammatory genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the pathogenesis of Candida albicans in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and to screen for aberrantly expressed genes during the process of infection. GSE7355 (accession no.) was downloaded from the National Center of Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus database and used to identify the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between the two groups, which included 4 samples from an untreated HUVEC control group, and 4 samples from HUVECs exposed to C. albicans. Subsequently, the gene ontology (GO) function package was used to perform GO and pathway enrichment analysis, prior to the extraction of DEG correlations in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the String database. In total, 77 DEGs were identified, including 69 upregulated and 8 downregulated DEGs in the C. albicans-infected HUVEC samples. DEGs were significantly enriched in response to external stimuli and chemokine activity. In addition, DEG FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (FOS) and interleukin (IL)-6 were significantly enriched in the Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. Nuclear factor κ light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 2 (NFKB2) was significantly enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway. In the interaction network of DEGs, according data included in the KEGG database, FOS and NFKB2 had higher connectivity degrees. Notably, FOS, IL-6 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 were demonstrated to have higher connectivity degrees in the PPI network. FOS, IL-6 and NFKB2 may be important genes for C. albicans infection in HUVECs, and these genes may act as therapeutic targets to treat patients infected with C. albicans.",nonCancer
577,Validation of ITD mutations in FLT3 as a therapeutic target in human acute myeloid leukaemia.,"Effective targeted cancer therapeutic development depends upon distinguishing disease-associated 'driver' mutations, which have causative roles in malignancy pathogenesis, from 'passenger' mutations, which are dispensable for cancer initiation and maintenance. Translational studies of clinically active targeted therapeutics can definitively discriminate driver from passenger lesions and provide valuable insights into human cancer biology. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are detected in approximately 20% of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. Abundant scientific and clinical evidence, including the lack of convincing clinical activity of early FLT3 inhibitors, suggests that FLT3-ITD probably represents a passenger lesion. Here we report point mutations at three residues within the kinase domain of FLT3-ITD that confer substantial in vitro resistance to AC220 (quizartinib), an active investigational inhibitor of FLT3, KIT, PDGFRA, PDGFRB and RET; evolution of AC220-resistant substitutions at two of these amino acid positions was observed in eight of eight FLT3-ITD-positive AML patients with acquired resistance to AC220. Our findings demonstrate that FLT3-ITD can represent a driver lesion and valid therapeutic target in human AML. AC220-resistant FLT3 kinase domain mutants represent high-value targets for future FLT3 inhibitor development efforts.",cancer
1670,The relationship of bleb morphology and the outcome of needle revision with 5-fluorouracil in failing filtering bleb.,"To investigate the risk factors for failure of needling revision with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and to identify the correlation of outcomes of needling revision and the morphological features of dysfunctional filtration blebs using Moorfields bleb grading system.This retrospective, nonrandomized, comparative case-control study included 41 consecutive patients (41 eyes) who underwent 5-FU needling revision for failed or failing filtration blebs between July 2012 and August 2014 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a referral center in Taiwan. The main outcome measures were the bleb survival and the correlation factors of bleb morphology before revision. The secondary outcome measure was the identification of any study factor associated with bleb failure.Forty-one eyes of 41 patients were included in this study. The most frequent glaucoma diagnoses were 10 cases (24%) of neovascular glaucoma and 8 cases (19%) of chronic open-angle glaucoma. Survival of bleb at 6, 12, and 24 months was 42%, 39%, and 23%. Fourteen cases (34%) maintained overall success at the last follow-up, with an average follow-up of 22.7 ± 9.4 months (range: 12-48 months). The central bleb area and height were significantly different between the successful needling group and the failed needling group (P = 0.03 and 0.04, respectively). Further trend test confirmed that smaller central bleb extension and flatter height were associated with a higher chance of failure (P = 0.02 and 0.02, respectively). Time from initial trabeculectomy to needling of less than 4 months and higher intraocular pressure (IOP) in the first postoperative week also led to significantly higher risk for failure (P = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively).A small central area and the flat height of dysfunctional blebs were more likely to fail after the needle revision. Cautious case selections, taking account of the time from the initial filtering surgery and postoperative IOP, may improve the surgical outcome.",nonCancer
966,Efficacy and Safety of Midostaurin in Advanced Systemic Mastocytosis.,"Advanced systemic mastocytosis comprises rare hematologic neoplasms that are associated with a poor prognosis and lack effective treatment options. The multikinase inhibitor midostaurin inhibits KIT D816V, a primary driver of disease pathogenesis. We conducted an open-label study of oral midostaurin at a dose of 100 mg twice daily in 116 patients, of whom 89 with mastocytosis-related organ damage were eligible for inclusion in the primary efficacy population; 16 had aggressive systemic mastocytosis, 57 had systemic mastocytosis with an associated hematologic neoplasm, and 16 had mast-cell leukemia. The primary outcome was the best overall response. The overall response rate was 60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49 to 70); 45% of the patients had a major response, which was defined as complete resolution of at least one type of mastocytosis-related organ damage. Response rates were similar regardless of the subtype of advanced systemic mastocytosis, KIT mutation status, or exposure to previous therapy. The median best percentage changes in bone marrow mast-cell burden and serum tryptase level were -59% and -58%, respectively. The median overall survival was 28.7 months, and the median progression-free survival was 14.1 months. Among the 16 patients with mast-cell leukemia, the median overall survival was 9.4 months (95% CI, 7.5 to not estimated). Dose reduction owing to toxic effects occurred in 56% of the patients; re-escalation to the starting dose was feasible in 32% of those patients. The most frequent adverse events were low-grade nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. New or worsening grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 24%, 41%, and 29% of the patients, respectively, mostly in those with preexisting cytopenias. In this open-label study, midostaurin showed efficacy in patients with advanced systemic mastocytosis, including the highly fatal variant mast-cell leukemia.

2152,CHD8 haploinsufficiency results in autistic-like phenotypes in mice.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) comprises a range of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by deficits in social interaction and communication as well as by restricted and repetitive behaviours. ASD has a strong genetic component with high heritability. Exome sequencing analysis has recently identified many de novo mutations in a variety of genes in individuals with ASD, with CHD8, a gene encoding a chromatin remodeller, being most frequently affected. Whether CHD8 mutations are causative for ASD and how they might establish ASD traits have remained unknown. Here we show that mice heterozygous for Chd8 mutations manifest ASD-like behavioural characteristics including increased anxiety, repetitive behaviour, and altered social behaviour. CHD8 haploinsufficiency did not result in prominent changes in the expression of a few specific genes but instead gave rise to small but global changes in gene expression in the mouse brain, reminiscent of those in the brains of patients with ASD. Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that neurodevelopment was delayed in the mutant mouse embryos. Furthermore, reduced expression of CHD8 was associated with abnormal activation of RE-1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which suppresses the transcription of many neuronal genes. REST activation was also observed in the brains of humans with ASD, and CHD8 was found to interact physically with REST in the mouse brain. Our results are thus consistent with the notion that CHD8 haploinsufficiency is a highly penetrant risk factor for ASD, with disease pathogenesis probably resulting from a delay in neurodevelopment.",nonCancer
814,ROS1 rearrangements define a unique molecular class of lung cancers.,"Chromosomal rearrangements involving the ROS1 receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been described in a subset of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Because little is known about these tumors, we examined the clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement. Using a ROS1 fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assay, we screened 1,073 patients with NSCLC and correlated ROS1 rearrangement status with clinical characteristics, overall survival, and when available, ALK rearrangement status. In vitro studies assessed the responsiveness of cells with ROS1 rearrangement to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor crizotinib. The clinical response of one patient with ROS1-rearranged NSCLC to crizotinib was investigated as part of an expanded phase I cohort. Of 1,073 tumors screened, 18 (1.7%) were ROS1 rearranged by FISH, and 31 (2.9%) were ALK rearranged. Compared with the ROS1-negative group, patients with ROS1 rearrangements were significantly younger and more likely to be never-smokers (each P < .001). All of the ROS1-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas, with a tendency toward higher grade. ROS1-positive and -negative groups showed no difference in overall survival. The HCC78 ROS1-rearranged NSCLC cell line and 293 cells transfected with CD74-ROS1 showed evidence of sensitivity to crizotinib. The patient treated with crizotinib showed tumor shrinkage, with a near complete response. ROS1 rearrangement defines a molecular subset of NSCLC with distinct clinical characteristics that are similar to those observed in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. Crizotinib shows in vitro activity and early evidence of clinical activity in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC.",cancer
171,The role of RAS oncogene in survival of patients with lung cancer: a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis.,"The proto-oncogene RAS, coding for a 21 kDa protein (p21), is mutated in 20% of lung cancer. However, the literature remains controversial on its prognostic significance for survival in lung cancer. We performed a systematic review of the literature with meta-analysis to assess its possible prognostic value on survival. Published studies on lung cancer assessing prognostic value of RAS mutation or p21 overexpression on survival were identified by an electronic search. After a methodological assessment, we estimated individual hazard ratios (HR) estimating RAS protein alteration or RAS mutation effect on survival and combined them using meta-analytic methods. In total, 53 studies were found eligible, with 10 concerning the same cohorts of patients. Among the 43 remaining studies, the revelation method was immunohistochemistry (IHC) in nine and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 34. Results in terms of survival were significantly pejorative, significantly favourable, not significant and not conclusive in 9, 1, 31, 2, respectively. In total, 29 studies were evaluable for meta-analysis but we aggregated only the 28 dealing with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and not the only one dealing with small-cell-lung cancer (SCLC). The quality scores were not statistically significantly different between studies with or without significant results in terms of survival, allowing us to perform a quantitative aggregation. The combined HR was 1.35 (95% CI: 1.16-1.56), showing a worse survival for NSCLC with KRAS2 mutations or p21 overexpression and, particularly, in adenocarcinomas (ADC) (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.26-2.02) and in studies using PCR (HR 1.40; 95% CI 1.18-1.65) but not in studies using IHC (HR 1.08; 95% CI 0.86-1.34). RAS appears to be a pejorative prognostic factor in terms of survival in NSCLC globally, in ADC and when it is studied by PCR.",cancer
703,Antitumor effects and molecular mechanisms of ponatinib on endometrial cancer cells harboring activating FGFR2 mutations.,"Aberrant mutational activation of FGFR2 is associated with endometrial cancers (ECs). AP24534 (ponatinib) currently undergoing clinical trials has been known to be an orally available multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Our biochemical kinase assay showed that AP24534 is potent against wild-type FGFR1-4 and 5 mutant FGFRs (V561M-FGFR1, N549H-FGFR2, K650E-FGFR3, G697C-FGFR3, N535K-FGFR4) and possesses the strongest kinase-inhibitory activity on N549H-FGFR2 (IC50 of 0.5 nM) among all FGFRs tested. We therefore investigated the effects of AP24534 on endometrial cancer cells harboring activating FGFR2 mutations and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. AP24534 significantly inhibited the proliferation of endometrial cancer cells bearing activating FGFR2 mutations (N549K, K310R/N549K, S252W) and mainly induced G1/S cell cycle arrest leading to apoptosis. AP24534 also diminished the kinase activity of immunoprecipitated FGFR2 derived from MFE-296 and MFE-280 cells and reduced the phosphorylation of FGFR2 and FRS2 on MFE-296 and AN3CA cells. AP24534 caused substantial reductions in ERK phosphorylation, PLCγ signaling and STAT5 signal transduction on ECs bearing FGFR2 activating mutations. Akt signaling pathway was also deactivated by AP24534. AP24534 causes the chemotherapeutic effect through mainly the blockade of ERK, PLCγ and STAT5 signal transduction on ECs. Moreover, AP24534 inhibited migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells with FGFR2 mutations. In addition, AP24534 significantly blocked anchorage-independent growth of endometrial cancer cells. We, for the first time, report the molecular mechanisms by which AP24534 exerts antitumor effects on ECs with FGFR2 activating mutations, which would provide mechanistic insight into ongoing clinical investigations of AP24534 for ECs.",cancer

Instead, disproportionately limited curricular time, teaching of non-evidence-based approaches, and modeling of conceptually confused combinations of techniques drawn from specialty BPD treatments are offered. In this article, we (1) explain why training in a generalist model is sensible and why alternative approaches are not appropriate for residents, (2) propose a plan for giving residents adequate training via a generalist model, highlighting minimal didactic and clinical-training objectives (dubbed ""core competencies"" and ""milestones"") and a model curriculum developed at the Massachusetts General Hospital/McLean Hospital residency program, and (3) describe obstacles to implementation of effective generalist training posed by infrastructural, faculty-centered, and resident-centered variables.",nonCancer
371,"Potent antitumor activity of cabozantinib, a c-MET and VEGFR2 inhibitor, in a colorectal cancer patient-derived tumor explant model.","Antiangiogenic therapy is commonly used for the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). Although patients derive some clinical benefit, treatment resistance inevitably occurs. The MET signaling pathway has been proposed to be a major contributor of resistance to antiangiogenic therapy. MET is upregulated in response to vascular endothelial growth factor pathway inhibition and plays an essential role in tumorigenesis and progression of tumors. In this study, we set out to determine the efficacy of cabozantinib in a preclinical CRC patient-derived tumor xenograft model. We demonstrate potent inhibitory effects on tumor growth in 80% of tumors treated. The greatest antitumor effects were observed in tumors that possess a mutation in the PIK3CA gene. The underlying antitumor mechanisms of cabozantinib consisted of inhibition of angiogenesis and Akt activation and significantly decreased expression of genes involved in the PI3K pathway. These findings support further evaluation of cabozantinib in patients with CRC. PIK3CA mutation as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity is intriguing and warrants further elucidation. A clinical trial of cabozantinib in refractory metastatic CRC is being activated.",cancer

We performed a retrospective review of patient records between 5 and 14 years old with a distal 1/3 radius or radius and ulna fracture requiring reduction. A cost comparison was also performed using facility costs for materials. Reduction was maintained with acceptable alignment in most cases (94%). Although a sugar-tong splint slightly maintained fracture alignment better, this was not significant. Cost analysis favored initial placement of a short-arm cast ($23.59) versus a splint with later cast conversion ($26.95). Pediatric patients with a distal 1/3 radius and/or both-bone fracture requiring reduction maintain postreduction alignment irrespective of the immobilization method used, but initial placement of a short-arm cast is more cost-effective.",nonCancer
1104,Characterization of MTAP Gene Expression in Breast Cancer Patients and Cell Lines.,"MTAP is a ubiquitously expressed gene important for adenine and methionine salvage. The gene is located at 9p21, a chromosome region often deleted in breast carcinomas, similar to CDKN2A, a recognized tumor suppressor gene. Several research groups have shown that MTAP acts as a tumor suppressor, and some therapeutic approaches were proposed based on a tumors´ MTAP status. We analyzed MTAP and CDKN2A gene (RT-qPCR) and protein (western-blotting) expression in seven breast cancer cell lines and evaluated their promoter methylation patterns to better characterize the contribution of these genes to breast cancer. Cytotoxicity assays with inhibitors of de novo adenine synthesis (5-FU, AZA and MTX) after MTAP gene knockdown showed an increased sensitivity, mainly to 5-FU. MTAP expression was also evaluated in two groups of samples from breast cancer patients, fresh tumors and paired normal breast tissue, and from formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) core breast cancer samples diagnosed as Luminal-A tumors and triple negative breast tumors (TNBC). The difference of MTAP expression between fresh tumors and normal tissues was not statistically significant. However, MTAP expression was significantly higher in Luminal-A breast tumors than in TNBC, suggesting the lack of expression in more aggressive breast tumors and the possibility of using the new approaches based on MTAP status in TNBC.",cancer
2417,Genistein inhibits A549 human lung cancer cell proliferation via miR-27a and MET signaling.,"Genistein is a soybean isoflavone; in its aglycone it has various biological activities. Animal experiments, clinical studies and epidemiological investigations suggest that genistein has preventative and curative functions for a number of diseases, particularly in cancer. The present study explored the potential anti-cancer effect of genistein by observing its role in inhibiting A549 human lung cancer cell proliferation and investigating the possible mechanism. A549 cells were exposed to various concentrations of genistein (0, 10, 25, 50, 100 and 200 µM; dissolved in physiological saline) for 1, 2 and 3 days. Subsequently, the viability of A549 cells was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, cell apoptosis was examined using a flow cytometer, caspase 3/9 activity was measured using commercial kits, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to analyze the miR-27a expression and western blotting was used to investigate MET protein expression. The results suggested a significant inhibition of A549 cell growth following treatment with genistein in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The current study also indicated that treatment with genistein significantly induces cell apoptosis and promotes caspase-3/9 activation of A549 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Further functional assays revealed that the anti-cancer effect of genistein activated microRNA-27a (miR-27a) expression levels and reduced MET protein expression in A549 cells. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that genistein inhibits A549 human lung cancer cell proliferation. Furthermore, this study reports, for the first time, a correlation between the anti-cancer effect of genistein and miR-27a-mediated MET signaling.",nonCancer
848,MEK targeting in N-RAS mutated metastatic melanoma.,"Gain of function mutations in B-RAF and N-RAS occur frequently in melanoma, leading to mitogen activating protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activation, and this pathway is the target of drugs in development. Our purpose was to study clinical characteristics of patients with mutations in this pathway and to determine activity of inhibitors of B-RAF and MEK in short term cultures grown from tumors of some of these patients. Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively on melanoma patients tested for B-RAF and N-RAS mutations at the Yale Cancer Center and associations with survival were determined. We studied in vitro activity of the pan-RAF inhibitor, RAF265, and the MEK inhibitor, MEK162, in 22 melanoma short term cultures. We further characterized the effect of MEK inhibition on apoptosis and growth of melanoma cultures. In a cohort of 144 metastatic melanoma patients we found that patients with N-RAS mutant melanoma had a worse prognosis. These patients were more likely to have brain metastases at the time of presentation with metastatic disease than their N-RAS-wild-type counterparts. All N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures tested in our study (n = 7) were sensitive to MEK inhibition 162. Exposure to MEK162 reduced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and induced apoptosis. Clonogenic survival was significantly reduced in sensitive melanoma cell cultures. The prognosis of patients with melanoma expressing constitutively active N-RAS is poor, consistent with studies performed at other institutions. N-RAS mutant melanoma cultures appear to be particularly sensitive to MEK162, supporting ongoing clinical trials with MEK162 in N-RAS mutated melanoma.",cancer
1412,Clinical Risk Factors for Head Impact During Falls in Older Adults: A Prospective Cohort Study in Long-Term Care.,"To examine risk factors associated with head impact during falls in older adults in long-term care (LTC).|Two LTC facilities in British Columbia, Canada.|160 LTC residents.|Prospective cohort study.|Between 2007 and 2014, we video captured 520 falls experienced by participants. Each fall video was analyzed to determine whether impact occurred to the head. Using generalized estimating equation models, we examined how head impact was associated with other fall characteristics and health status prior to the fall.|Head impact occurred in 33% of falls. Individuals with mild cognitive impairment were at higher risk for head impact (odds ratio = 2.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-5.0) than those with more severe cognitive impairment. Impaired vision was associated with 2.0-fold (1.3-3.0) higher odds of head impact. Women were 2.2 times (1.4-3.3) more likely than men to impact their head during a fall.|Head impact is common during falls in LTC, with less cognitively impaired, female residents who suffered from visual impairment, being most likely to impact their head. Future research should focus on improving our ability to detect neural consequences of head impact and evaluating the effect of interventions for reducing the risk for fall-related head injuries in LTC.",nonCancer
1024,Identification of a novel HER3 activating mutation homologous to EGFR-L858R in lung cancer.,"Somatic mutations found within the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD) of the human epidermal growth factor (HER) family of receptors have been implicated in the development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, no conclusive reports have described pathogenic mutations in kinase-impaired HER3. Here, we report a case of an advanced chemotherapy-resistant NSCLC, harboring a novel HER3(V855A) somatic mutation homologous to the EGFR(L858R)activating mutation. Co-expression of HER3(V855A) and wild-type HER2 enhances ligand-induced transformation of murine and human cell lines, while HER-targeted inhibitors potently suppress mutant HER3 activity. Consistent with these observations, in silico computational modeling predicts that mutant V855A alters the kinase domain and c-terminal end of the HER3 protein. Taken together, these findings provide a basis for the clinical exploration of targeted therapies in HER3 mutant NSCLC and by extrapolation, in other cancers that more frequently carry somatic HER3 mutations.",cancer
986,The GADD45A (1506T>C) Polymorphism Is Associated with Ovarian Cancer Susceptibility and Prognosis.,"GADD45A (growth arrest and DNA damage 45 A) is the first stress-inducible gene identified to be a target of p53. However, no studies to date have assessed variants of the GADD45 gene and their potential relationship to tumor susceptibility. We investigated the association of the GADD45A (1506T>C) polymorphism with ovarian cancer development in 258 ovarian cancer patients and 332 age-matched healthy women as controls using sequence analysis. We found a statistically significant difference in the GADD45A (1506T>C) genotype distributions between the case and control groups (TT vs. TC vs. CC, P = 0.0021) and found that variant 1506T>C was significantly associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer (P<0.001, OR = 1.71, 95% CI [1.28-2.29]). We observed a statistically significant effect between tumor histology (P = 0.032) and CA125 status (P = 0.021). Carrying the C allele (TC+CC) was associated with an increased risk of positive CA125 (OR = 3.20, 95% CI [1.15-8.71). Carrying the T allele (TT+TC) showed a significant correlation with both higher GADD45A mRNA expression and longer ovarian cancer RFS (relapse-free survival) and OS (overall survival). We are the first group to demonstrate that the GADD45A (1506T>C) polymorphism is associated with ovarian cancer susceptibility and prognosis. These data suggest that GADD45A (1506T>C) is a new tumor susceptibility gene and could be a useful molecular marker for assessing ovarian cancer risk and for predicting ovarian cancer patient prognosis.",cancer
1138,Evaluation of the association of PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss with efficacy of trastuzumab therapy in metastatic breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab (T) is effective in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) with HER2 overexpression and/or amplification, but resistance to T develops in a significant number of HER2-positive patients. Understanding the mechanisms of resistance is critical to the care of these patients. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue samples were collected from 256 patients with T-treated MBC. Clinical information was collected retrospectively from the patients' medical records. Central review of HER2 status by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) revealed that of the 227 eligible patients only 139 (61%) were truly HER2-positive. PTEN, ER, PgR, and Ki67 were evaluated by IHC, while PTEN status was evaluated by FISH as well. PIK3CA mutations were identified with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping. Median time to progression (TTP) was 14.4 months for the HER2-positive and 10.3 for the HER2-negative patients (log-rank, P = 0.22). Survival from the initiation of T (survivalT) was 50.4 months for the HER2-positive and 35.3 for the HER2-negative subgroups (P = 0.006). Higher risk of progression was associated with HER2-positive status and the presence of PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.014). PTEN loss, as determined by IHC, was associated with lower survivalT in the whole population (P = 0.029) and in the HER2-positive population (P = 0.017). PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss status were evaluated together as a single parameter, to estimate the impact of activation of the PI3K/AKT molecular pathway, and it was significantly associated with both decreased TTP (P = 0.003 in the total population, P = 0.004 in HER2-positive patients) and survival (survivalT, P = 0.011 in total, P = 0.006 in HER2-positive). In this trastuzumab-treated breast cancer population, PIK3CA activating mutations were associated with shorter TTP and PTEN loss with decreased survival. The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway from either defect was associated with both TTP and survival, indicating the adverse effect of this pathway's status on trastuzumab efficacy.",cancer
461,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 as a putative therapy target in colorectal cancer.,"Resembling a potential therapeutic drug target, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification and expression was assessed in 515 human colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue samples, lymph node metastases and CRC cell lines. FGFR1 amplification status was determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization. Additionally, we assessed protein levels employing Western blots and immunohistochemistry. The FGFR1 mRNA localization was analyzed using mRNA in situ hybridization. Functional studies employed the FGFR inhibitor NVP-BGJ398. Of 454 primary CRCs, 24 displayed FGFR1 amplification. 92/94 lymph node metastases presented the same amplification status as the primary tumor. Of 99 investigated tumors, 18 revealed membranous activated pFGFR1 protein. FGFR1 mRNA levels were independent of the amplification status or pFGFR1 protein occurrence. In vitro, a strong antiproliferative effect of NVP-BGJ398 could be detected in cell lines exhibiting high FGFR1 protein. FGFR1 is a potential therapeutic target in a subset of CRC. FGFR1 protein is likely to represent a central factor limiting the efficacy of FGFR inhibitors. The lack of correlation between its evaluation at genetic/mRNA level and its protein occurrence indicates that the assessment of the receptor at an immunohistochemical level most likely represents a suitable way to assess FGFR1 as a predictive biomarker for patient selection in future clinical trials.",cancer
2319,The antioxidative properties of S-allyl cysteine not only influence somatic cells but also improve early embryo cleavage in pigs.,"In vitro cultivation systems for oocytes and embryos are characterised by increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can be balanced by the addition of suitable antioxidants. S-allyl cysteine (SAC) is a sulfur compound naturally occurring in garlic (Allium sativum), which is responsible for its high antioxidant properties. In this study, we demonstrated the capacity of SAC (0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 mM) to reduce levels of ROS in maturing oocytes significantly after 24 (reduced by 90.33, 82.87 and 91.62%, respectively) and 48 h (reduced by 86.35, 94.42 and 99.05%, respectively) cultivation, without leading to a disturbance of the standard course of meiotic maturation. Oocytes matured in the presence of SAC furthermore maintained reduced levels of ROS even 22 h after parthenogenic activation (reduced by 66.33, 61.64 and 57.80%, respectively). In these oocytes we also demonstrated a growth of early embryo cleavage rate (increased by 33.34, 35.00 and 35.00%, respectively). SAC may be a valuable supplement to cultivation media.",nonCancer
1072,Mutation of the PTEN (MMAC1) tumor suppressor gene in a subset of glioblastomas but not in meningiomas with loss of chromosome arm 10q.,"The PTEN (MMAC1) gene, which has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene at 10q23.3, is mutated in multiple malignant tumors, including glioblastomas [J. Li et al., Science (Washington DC), 275: 1943-1947, 1997; P. A. Steck et al., Nat. Genet., 15: 356-362, 1997]. Among tumors of the central nervous system, loss of 10q is not restricted to glioblastomas but is also common in atypical and anaplastic meningiomas. Therefore, we have investigated 36 glioblastomas and 34 meningiomas (2 benign, 17 atypical, and 15 anaplastic meningiomas) for loss on 10q, as well as deletion, mutation, and expression of PTEN. Analysis of eight microsatellites from 10q revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 25 of 36 glioblastomas (69%). Twenty-three of these tumors demonstrated LOH at all informative loci. Two glioblastomas showed LOH restricted to markers located distally to PTEN, with breakpoints mapping telomeric to D10S541 and D10S185. One glioblastoma demonstrated evidence of homozygous deletion of PTEN by differential PCR analysis. PTEN mutations were detected in 9 of 36 glioblastomas (25%). Seven of these tumors showed LOH at all informative loci from 10q, indicating complete loss of wild-type PTEN. Although loss of 10q was detected by comparative genomic hybridization and/or LOH analysis in 14 of the 34 meningiomas investigated (41%), none of these tumors showed evidence of PTEN mutations or homozygous gene deletions. Our findings corroborate that PTEN is inactivated in a subset of glioblastomas. However, the lack of detectable PTEN alterations in a considerable fraction of glioblastomas and all meningiomas with 10q loss strongly supports the hypothesis that at least one additional tumor suppressor gene is located on 10q.",cancer
1016,A novel WWTR1-CAMTA1 gene fusion is a consistent abnormality in epithelioid hemangioendothelioma of different anatomic sites.,"The classification of epithelioid vascular tumors remains challenging, as there is considerable morphological overlap between tumor subtypes, across the spectrum from benign to malignant categories. A t(1;3)(p36.3;q25) translocation was reported in two cases of epithelioid hemangioendothelioma (EHE), however, no follow-up studies have been performed to identify the gene fusion or to assess its prevalence in a larger cohort of patients. We undertook a systematic molecular analysis of 17 EHE, characterized by classic morphological and immunophenotypic features, from various anatomical locations and with different malignant potential. For comparison, we analyzed 13 epithelioid hemangiomas, five epithelioid angiosarcomas, and four epithelioid sarcoma-like EHE. A fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positional cloning strategy, spanning the cytogenetically defined regions on chromosomes 1p36.3 and 3q25, confirmed rearrangements in two candidate genes from these loci in all EHE cases tested. None of the other benign or malignant epithelioid vascular tumors examined demonstrated these abnormalities. Subsequent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed in three EHE the WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion product. CAMTA1 and WWTR1 have been previously shown to play important roles in oncogenesis. Our results demonstrate the presence of a WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion in all EHE tested from bone, soft tissue, and visceral location (liver, lung) in keeping with a unique and specific pathological entity. Thus, FISH or RT-PCR analysis for the presence of WWTR1-CAMTA1 fusion may serve as a useful molecular diagnostic tool in challenging diagnoses.",cancer
1883,"Incidence of Depression After Stroke, and Associated Risk Factors and Mortality Outcomes, in a Large Cohort of Danish Patients.","More than 30 million people live with a stroke diagnosis worldwide. Depression after stroke is frequent, and greater knowledge of associated risk factors and outcomes is needed to understand the etiology and implications of this disabling complication.|To examine whether the incidence of and risk factors for depression differ between patients with stroke and a reference population without stroke and to assess how depression influences mortality.|Register-based cohort study in Denmark. Participants were all individuals 15 years or older with a first-time hospitalization for stroke between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2011 (n = 157 243), and a reference population (n = 160 236) matched on age, sex, and municipality. The data were analyzed between January and March 2016.|The incidence of depression and mortality outcomes of depression (defined by hospital discharge diagnoses or antidepressant medication use) were examined using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses.|In total, 34 346 patients (25.4%) with stroke and 11 330 (7.8%) in the reference population experienced depression within 2 years after study entry. Compared with the reference population, patients with stroke had a higher incidence of depression during the first 3 months after hospitalization (hazard ratio for stroke vs the reference population, 8.99; 95% CI, 8.61-9.39), which declined during the second year of follow-up (hazard ratio for stroke vs the reference population, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.85-2.08). Significant risk factors for depression for patients with stroke and the reference population included older age, female sex, single cohabitation status, basic educational attainment, diabetes, high level of somatic comorbidity, history of depression, and stroke severity (in patients with stroke). The associations were strongest for the reference population. In both populations, depressed individuals, especially those with new onset, had increased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio for new-onset depression, 1.89 [95% CI, 1.83-1.95] for patients with stroke and 3.75 [95% CI, 3.51-4.00] for the reference population) after adjustment for confounders. Similar patterns were found for natural and unnatural causes of death. In most models, the depression-related relative mortality was approximately twice as high in the reference population vs the stroke population.|Depression is common in patients with stroke during the first year after diagnosis, and those with prior depression or severe stroke are especially at risk. Because a large number of deaths can be attributable to depression after stroke, clinicians should be aware of this risk.",nonCancer

In this study, we examined cervical swab samples from 713 females with genital warts, and tested the samples for high- and low-risk genital HPV. HPV genotyping was assessed using a Genotyping test that detects HPV by the amplification of target DNA using polymerase chain reaction and nucleic acid hybridization. In total, we detected 37 anogenital HPV DNA genotypes [6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35, 39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73 (MM9), 81, 82 (MM4), 83 (MM7), 84 (MM8), IS39 and CP6108] and investigated the incidence of these genotypes in the patients with genital warts. We found differences in the distribution of high-/low-risk strains and the incidence of high-risk strains was found to occur mainly in females under 35 years of age. The data from our study suggest that a detailed oral, rectal and genital identification of high-risk strains should be performed to visualize the entire pattern of possible triggers of carcinogenesis.",nonCancer
669,KDR Mutation as a Novel Predictive Biomarker of Exceptional Response to Regorafenib in Metastatic Colorectal Cancer.,"This is the case of an 84-year-old woman diagnosed with Stage IVb colon adenocarcinoma (CRC) metastatic to the liver, retroperitoneum, anastomotic site, and distal rectal sigmoid colon. She experienced intolerable side effects to systemic chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and bevacizumab, as well as disease progression. Next generation sequencing of her tumor was ordered, and further discussion of her malignancy's genomic information took place at a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board. The patient had mutations in KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) which made her ineligible for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors; however, a KDR p.R961W c.2881C>T mutation was noted as a variant of unknown significance (VUS). KDR (kinase insert domain receptor) is the human gene encoding for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2). She was then considered a suitable candidate for regorafenib, which she could only tolerate at a low dose of 40 mg daily, with the intent of prolonging her survival and to optimize her quality of life. We report her excellent tolerance and exceptional response to low dose regorafenib, including symptomatic, tumor marker, and sustained partial metabolic radiological improvement. In the largest Phase III trial of regorafenib in CRC, only five patients (1%) of 760 experienced a partial response (versus one patient, 0.4%, receiving placebo). KDR R961W mutation has been described but no functional data has been reported. This mutation occurs in the tyrosine kinase domain of the VEGFR-2. Regorafenib targets VEGFR-2 (KDR). Hereby we hypothesize KDR mutation as a novel predictive biomarker to exceptional response to regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of the potential correlation between KDR mutation and regorafenib use for the successful management of a patient with advanced CRC, leading to what is considered an exceptional response. Further studies based on this preliminary data are warranted.",cancer
989,Molecular diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor in routinely processed tissue: a comparison of two FISH strategies and RT-PCR in malignant round cell tumors.,"Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumor (EWS/PNET) is a diagnostically challenging malignant round cell tumor with signature translocations involving the EWS gene. These translocations are detectable with both reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. However, RT-PCR is less sensitive in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded than frozen tissue. Similarly, commercial FISH probes have recently become available, but have yet to be rigorously tested in the clinical setting. Therefore, we have compared RT-PCR with FISH using 'home brew' fusion probes for Ewing sarcoma (EWS)-FLI1 and a commercial EWS break apart probe set in 67 archival round cell tumors, including 27 EWS/PNETs. Sensitivities and specificities for both FISH assays were 91 and 100%, respectively, whereas RT-PCR had a sensitivity of 54% and a specificity of 85%. The break apart strategy was easier to interpret than probe fusion approach. We conclude that FISH is a more sensitive and reliable ancillary technique than RT-PCR for the diagnosis of EWS/PNET in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue, although the latter provides additional information regarding fusion transcript subtype and prognosis. The commercial break apart probe set is both readily available and easy to interpret, making it particularly attractive. Nonetheless, complex round cell tumors often benefit from molecular testing with multiple methods.",cancer

The aim of this study was to compare platinum-resistant recurrence following treatment with NACT-IDS or PDS in patients with stage IIIC and IV EOC.We retrospectively reviewed the records of 341 patients who underwent PDS or NACT-IDS for Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage IIIC or IV EOC between March 1990 and December 2010. Risk factors of platinum resistance, including NACT, postoperative residual tumor size, and various clinicopathological factors, were evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Survival analysis was performed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression modeling to measure overall survival (OS).Of 341 patients, 58 (17.0%) underwent NACT-IDS and 283 (83.0%) were treated with PDS. Twenty-nine (50.0%) patients developed platinum-resistant disease at first relapse after NACT-IDS and 99 (35.0%) patients recurred after PDS (P = 0.033). In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, NACT-IDS and postoperative residual tumor mass >1 cm were risk factors for platinum-resistant recurrence (adjusted odds ratios 2.950 and 2.915; 95% confidence intervals [CIs] 1.572-5.537 and 1.780-4.771, P = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively). Postoperative residual tumor mass >1 cm and platinum-resistant disease were significantly correlated with shorter OS (adjusted hazard ratios 1.579 and 4.078; 95% CI 1.193-2.089 and 3.074-5.412, P = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), whereas NACT-IDS did not extend OS.NACT-IDS increases the risk of platinum-resistant recurrence in patients with stage IIIC and IV EOC.",nonCancer
2483,A polymorphism at the microRNA binding site in the 3'-untranslated region of C14orf101 is associated with the risk of gastric cancer development.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) bind to the 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of mRNAs, affecting translation and regulating cell differentiation, tumorigenesis and apoptosis. Genetic polymorphisms in these regions in target genes are able to affect the binding affinity between miRNA and target genes, ultimately affecting the expression of individual miRNAs. In the present case-control study, genotyping of 5 microRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located at the binding site of the 3'-UTR of RYR3 (rs1044129), C14orf101 (rs4901706), KIAA0423 (rs1053667), GOLGA7 (rs11337) and KRT81 (rs3660) genes was assessed in order to investigate its role in gastric cancer (GC). The results indicated that the rs4901706 SNP, which is located in the 3'-UTR of C14orf101, was associated with GC development risk, as determined by χ(2) analysis (relative risk, 1.630; 95% confidence interval, 1.070-2.483; P=0.022). A Renilla/luciferase reporter assay also indicated the different binding affinity between the SNP of rs4901706 and microRNA. In conclusion, rs4901706 SNP of C14orf101 gene in the microRNA binding site may be used as a valuable biomarker when predicting GC risk.",nonCancer
802,Combined vemurafenib and cobimetinib in BRAF-mutated melanoma.,"The combined inhibition of BRAF and MEK is hypothesized to improve clinical outcomes in patients with melanoma by preventing or delaying the onset of resistance observed with BRAF inhibitors alone. This randomized phase 3 study evaluated the combination of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and the MEK inhibitor cobimetinib. We randomly assigned 495 patients with previously untreated unresectable locally advanced or metastatic BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma to receive vemurafenib and cobimetinib (combination group) or vemurafenib and placebo (control group). The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. The median progression-free survival was 9.9 months in the combination group and 6.2 months in the control group (hazard ratio for death or disease progression, 0.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.39 to 0.68; P<0.001). The rate of complete or partial response in the combination group was 68%, as compared with 45% in the control group (P<0.001), including rates of complete response of 10% in the combination group and 4% in the control group. Progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was similar to investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Interim analyses of overall survival showed 9-month survival rates of 81% (95% CI, 75 to 87) in the combination group and 73% (95% CI, 65 to 80) in the control group. Vemurafenib and cobimetinib was associated with a nonsignificantly higher incidence of adverse events of grade 3 or higher, as compared with vemurafenib and placebo (65% vs. 59%), and there was no significant difference in the rate of study-drug discontinuation. The number of secondary cutaneous cancers decreased with the combination therapy. The addition of cobimetinib to vemurafenib was associated with a significant improvement in progression-free survival among patients with BRAF V600-mutated metastatic melanoma, at the cost of some increase in toxicity.

We show here that BRAFi (or BRAFi + MEKi) therapy in patients frequently led to rebound phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) levels in their melanomas early on-treatment. In cell lines, BRAFi treatment led to rebound levels of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK; including PDGFRβ), phosphatidyl (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP3), pleckstrin homology domain recruitment, and p-AKT. PTEN expression limited this BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling, which could be rescued by the introduction of a mutant AKT1 (Q79K) known to confer acquired BRAFi resistance. Functionally, AKT1(Q79K) conferred BRAFi resistance via amplification of BRAFi-elicited PI3K-AKT signaling. In addition, mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway inhibition enhanced clonogenic growth dependency on PI3K or AKT. Thus, adaptive or genetic upregulation of AKT critically participates in melanoma survival during BRAFi therapy.",cancer
30,RAS mutation in acute myeloid leukemia is associated with distinct cytogenetic subgroups but does not influence outcome in patients younger than 60 years.,"The pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) involves the cooperation of mutations promoting proliferation/survival and those impairing differentiation. The RAS pathway has been implicated as a key component of the proliferative drive in AML. We have screened AML patients, predominantly younger than 60 years and treated within 2 clinical trials, for NRAS (n = 1106), KRAS (n = 739), and HRAS (n = 200) hot-spot mutations using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography or restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. NRAS mutations were confirmed in 11% of patients (126/1106) and KRAS mutations in 5% (39/739). No HRAS mutations were detected in 200 randomly selected samples. Codons most frequently mutated were N12 (43%), N13 (21%), and K12 (21%). KRAS mutations were relatively overrepresented in French-American-British (FAB) type M4 (P < .001). NRAS mutation was over-represented in the t(3;5)(q21 approximately 25;q31 approximately q35) subgroup (P < .001) and underrepresented in t(15;17)(q22;q21) (P < .001). KRAS mutation was overrepresented in inv(16)(p13q22) (P = .004). Twenty-three percent of KRAS mutations were within the inv(16) subgroup. RAS mutation and FLT3 ITD were rarely coexistent (14/768; P < .001). Median percentage of RAS mutant allele assayed by quantitative RFLP analysis was 28% (N12), 19% (N13), 25% (N61), and 21% (K12). RAS mutation did not influence clinical outcome (overall/disease-free survival, complete remission, relapse rate) either for the entire cohort or within cytogenetic risk groups.",cancer
2485,Corneal hydrops induced by diabetic ketoacidosis: A case report.,"To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of corneal hydrops associated with diabetic ketoacidosis. The present study first reports a case of a 20-year-old male patient with diabetic ketoacidosis-induced corneal hydrops. The patient exhibited mild hydrops in their left eyelid, which was accompanied by mixed hyperemia, and hazy turbid in a white color was observed in the cornea. To alleviate the corneal hydrops, 5% glucose was administered dropwise to the left eye for 2 h to alleviate the inflammation. Finally, the patient was discharged from the hospital with a satisfactory outcome.",nonCancer
546,Multicenter phase I trial of the mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 inhibitor BAY 86-9766 in patients with advanced cancer.,"To evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of BAY 86-9766, a selective, potent, orally available, small-molecule allosteric inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 in patients with advanced solid tumors. BAY 86-9766 was administered orally daily in 28-day courses, with doses escalated to establish the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). An expanded cohort was evaluated at the MTD. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed, with extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation evaluated in paired biopsies from a subset of the expanded MTD cohort. Tumor specimens were evaluated for mutations in select genes. Sixty-nine patients were enrolled, including 20 patients at the MTD. The MTD was 100 mg given once-daily or in two divided doses. BAY 86-9766 was well-tolerated. The most common treatment-related toxicities were acneiform rash and gastrointestinal toxicity. BAY 86-9766 was well-absorbed after oral administration (plasma half-life ~12 hours), and displayed dose proportional pharmacokinetics throughout the tested dose range. Continuous daily dosing resulted in moderate accumulation at most dose levels. BAY 86-9766 suppressed ERK phosphorylation in biopsied tissue and tetradecanoylphorbol acetate-stimulated peripheral blood leukocytes. Of 53 evaluable patients, one patient with colorectal cancer achieved a partial response and 11 patients had stable disease for 4 or more courses. An ocular melanoma specimen harbored a GNAQ-activating mutation and exhibited reduced ERK phosphorylation in response to therapy. This phase I study showed that BAY 86-9766 was well-tolerated, with good oral absorption, dose proportional pharmacokinetics, target inhibition at the MTD, and some evidence of clinical benefit across a range of tumor types.",cancer
1037,Durable Clinical Response to Entrectinib in NTRK1-Rearranged Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Chromosomal rearrangements involving neurotrophic tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) occur in a subset of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and other solid tumor malignancies, leading to expression of an oncogenic TrkA fusion protein. Entrectinib (RXDX-101) is an orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor, including TrkA. We sought to determine the frequency of NTRK1 rearrangements in NSCLC and to assess the clinical activity of entrectinib. We screened 1378 cases of NSCLC using anchored multiplex polymerase chain reaction (AMP). A patient with an NTRK1 gene rearrangement was enrolled onto a Phase 1 dose escalation study of entrectinib in adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumors (NCT02097810). We assessed safety and response to treatment. We identified NTRK1 gene rearrangements at a frequency of 0.1% in this cohort. A patient with stage IV lung adenocrcinoma with an SQSTM1-NTRK1 fusion transcript expression was treated with entrectinib. Entrectinib was well tolerated, with no grade 3-4 adverse events. Within three weeks of starting on treatment, the patient reported resolution of prior dyspnea and pain. Restaging CT scans demonstrated a RECIST partial response (PR) and complete resolution of all brain metastases. This patient has continued on treatment for over 6 months with an ongoing PR. Entrectinib demonstrated significant anti-tumor activity in a patient with NSCLC harboring an SQSTM1-NTRK1 gene rearrangement, indicating that entrectinib may be an effective therapy for tumors with NTRK gene rearrangements, including those with central nervous system metastases.",cancer
82,Prognostic relevance of FLT3-TKD mutations in AML: the combination matters--an analysis of 3082 patients.,"We characterized the mutational status of the FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3-TLD) in 3082 patients with newly diagnosed AML. FLT3-TKD mutations were detected in 147 of 3082 (4.8%) patients. Similar to the FLT3 juxtamembrane domain mutations (FLT3-LM), there was a high correlation of FLT3-TKD mutations with normal karyotype (88 of 1472; 6.0%). FLT3-TKD mutations were most frequent in the AML FAB subtypes M5b (15 of 114; 13.2%), M3v (6 of 51; 11.8%), and M4 (39 of 484; 8.1%). Similar to FLT3-LM, the FLT3-TKD mutations show elevated peripheral leukocytes compared with FLT3wt AML. FLT3-TKD had a high incidence in cases with NPM1 mutations (23 of 262; 8.8%), CEBPA mutations (6 of 76; 7.9%), and NRAS mutations (6 of 78; 7.7%). FLT3-TKD in combination with FLT3-LM (17 of 594 patients; 2.9%) and KITD816 (1 of 44; 2.3%) was rare. Unlike the FLT3-LM, which are associated with inferior survival, prognosis was not influenced by FLT3-TKD in the total cohort of 1720 cases, where follow-up data were available (97 FLT3-TKD; 1623 FLT3-WT). In t(15;17)/PML-RARA with FLT3-TKD mutations, in FLT3-LM/TKD double-mutated, and in MLL-PTD/TKD double-mutated cases prognosis was unfavorably influenced by FLT3-TKD mutations. In contrast, we found an additional favorable impact of FLT3-TKD on EFS in prognostically favorable AML with NPM1- or CEBPA mutations.",cancer

893,Toward the molecular dissection of peritoneal pseudomyxoma.,"Outcome of pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hypertermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is heterogeneous even after adjusting for clinico-pathological prognostic variables. The identification of additional prognostic or even predictive biomarkers is an unmet clinical need. Forty patients with mucinous appendiceal tumors and PMP were clinically eligible and had evaluable tumor samples obtained after CRS and HIPEC. We carried out next-generations sequencing (NGS) of 50 gene's hotspot regions contained in the Hotspot Cancer Panel v2 using the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine platform (Life Technologies). KRAS and GNAS mutations were found in 72% and 52%, and their allelic frequency was below 10% in 55% and 43% of samples, respectively. KRAS and GNAS mutations were associated with worse progression-free survival (PFS) at univariate analysis (P = 0.006 and 0.011, respectively). At multivariate analysis, only KRAS mutations were independently associated with PFS (P = 0.012); GNAS mutations were not-being significantly associated with other poor prognostic features such as incomplete cytoreduction or KRAS mutations. Validation of results was carried out in an independent bi-institutional cohort of 25 patients and the prognostic effect of KRAS mutations was again confirmed in the multivariate model (P = 0.029). NGS approach allowed the discovery of other potentially druggable mutations such as those in PI3K, AKT, LKB1, FGFR3 and PDGFRA. Given the homogeneity of this series and the sensitivity of NGS in this low-cellularity tumor, we demonstrated for the first time a poor prognostic role of KRAS mutations.",cancer
193,Somatic mutations altering EZH2 (Tyr641) in follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas of germinal-center origin.,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and the GCB subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) derive from germinal center B cells. Targeted resequencing studies have revealed mutations in various genes encoding proteins in the NF-kappaB pathway that contribute to the activated B-cell (ABC) DLBCL subtype, but thus far few GCB-specific mutations have been identified. Here we report recurrent somatic mutations affecting the polycomb-group oncogene EZH2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase responsible for trimethylating Lys27 of histone H3 (H3K27). After the recent discovery of mutations in KDM6A (UTX), which encodes the histone H3K27me3 demethylase UTX, in several cancer types, EZH2 is the second histone methyltransferase gene found to be mutated in cancer. These mutations, which result in the replacement of a single tyrosine in the SET domain of the EZH2 protein (Tyr641), occur in 21.7% of GCB DLBCLs and 7.2% of FLs and are absent from ABC DLBCLs. Our data are consistent with the notion that EZH2 proteins with mutant Tyr641 have reduced enzymatic activity in vitro.",cancer
798,Combined BRAF and MEK Inhibition With Dabrafenib and Trametinib in BRAF V600-Mutant Colorectal Cancer.,"To evaluate dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, combined with trametinib, a selective MEK inhibitor, in patients with BRAF V600-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A total of 43 patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC were treated with dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) plus trametinib (2 mg daily), 17 of whom were enrolled onto a pharmacodynamic cohort undergoing mandatory biopsies before and during treatment. Archival tissues were analyzed for microsatellite instability, PTEN status, and 487-gene sequencing. Patient-derived xenografts were established from core biopsy samples. Of 43 patients, five (12%) achieved a partial response or better, including one (2%) complete response, with duration of response > 36 months; 24 patients (56%) achieved stable disease as best confirmed response. Ten patients (23%) remained in the study > 6 months. All nine evaluable during-treatment biopsies had reduced levels of phosphorylated ERK relative to pretreatment biopsies (average decrease ± standard deviation, 47% ± 24%). Mutational analysis revealed that the patient achieving a complete response and two of three evaluable patients achieving a partial response had PIK3CA mutations. Neither PTEN loss nor microsatellite instability correlated with efficacy. Responses to dabrafenib plus trametinib were comparable in patient-derived xenograft-bearing mice and the biopsied lesions from each corresponding patient. The combination of dabrafenib plus trametinib has activity in a subset of patients with BRAF V600-mutant mCRC. Mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling was inhibited in all patients evaluated, but to a lesser degree than observed in BRAF-mutant melanoma with dabrafenib alone. PIK3CA mutations were identified in responding patients and thus do not preclude response to this regimen. Additional studies targeting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in this disease are warranted.",cancer
58,Prevalence and prognostic impact of NPM1 mutations in 1485 adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).,"Mutations of the nucleophosmin (NPM1) gene have recently been described in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To clarify the prevalence as well as the clinical impact of this mutation, we investigated 1485 patients with AML for NPM1 exon 12 mutations using fragment analysis. A 4 bp insert was detected in 408 of 1485 patients (27.5%). Sequence analysis revealed known mutations (type A, B, and D) as well as 13 novel alterations in 229 analyzed cases. NPM1 mutations were most prevalent in patients with normal karyotype (NK) (324 of 709; 45.7%) compared with 58 of 686 with karyotype abnormalities (8.5%; P < .001) and were significantly associated with several clinical parameters (high bone marrow [BM] blasts, high white blood cell [WBC] and platelet counts, female sex). NPM1 alterations were associated with FLT3-ITD mutations, even if restricted to patients with NK (NPM1-mut/FLT3-ITD: 43.8%; versus NPM1-wt/FLT3-ITD: 19.9%; P < .001). The analysis of the clinical impact in 4 groups (NPM1 and FLT3-ITD single mutants, double mutants, and wild-type [wt] for both) revealed that patients having only an NPM1 mutation had a significantly better overall and disease-free survival and a lower cumulative incidence of relapse. In conclusion, NPM1 mutations represent a common genetic abnormality in adult AML. If not associated with FLT3-ITD mutations, mutant NPM1 appears to identify patients with improved response toward treatment.",cancer
2448,p21 participates in the regulation of anaplastic thyroid cancer cell proliferation by miR-146b.,"Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) originates from completely undifferentiated cells, and is the most lethal type of thyroid-derived tumor. Numerous microRNAs have significant roles in tumorigenesis by targeting relevant genes. The role of microRNA 146b (miR-146b) in ATC remains to be elucidated. In order to characterize the role of miR-146b in ATC, overexpression or interference of miR-146b was induced in ATC cell lines, and cell proliferation and migration were evaluated. The potential targets of miR-146b were searched in the Gene Expression Omnibus database for ATC and matched non-tumor control samples. The expression level of potential targets was detected following overexpression or interference of miR-146b in ATC cell lines. In the present study, cell proliferation was promoted when overexpression of miR-146b was induced in ATC, and inhibited when interference of miR-146b was induced, which indicated that miR-146b affects the proliferation of ATC cells in vitro. In addition, cell migration of ATC was also affected by miR-146b. During the search for potential targets of miR-146b in ATC, p21 (also known as p21 (Waf1/Cip1) or CDKN1A) was noted for its role in cell cycle progression and tumor pathogenesis. The expression level of p21 was influenced by the level of miR-146b, and the results of the present study demonstrated that the level of p21 was increased when FRO cells were transformed with miR-146b mimic, and p21 was downregulated when FRO cells transformed with anti-miR-146b. In conclusion, p21 may participate in the regulation of ATC cell proliferation by miR-146b.",nonCancer
429,"Stathmin protein level, a potential predictive marker for taxane treatment response in endometrial cancer.","Stathmin is a prognostic marker in many cancers, including endometrial cancer. Preclinical studies, predominantly in breast cancer, have suggested that stathmin may additionally be a predictive marker for response to paclitaxel. We first evaluated the response to paclitaxel in endometrial cancer cell lines before and after stathmin knock-down. Subsequently we investigated the clinical response to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy in metastatic endometrial cancer in relation to stathmin protein level in tumors. Stathmin level was also determined in metastatic lesions, analyzing changes in biomarker status on disease progression. Knock-down of stathmin improved sensitivity to paclitaxel in endometrial carcinoma cell lines with both naturally higher and lower sensitivity to paclitaxel. In clinical samples, high stathmin level was demonstrated to be associated with poor response to paclitaxel containing chemotherapy and to reduced disease specific survival only in patients treated with such combination. Stathmin level increased significantly from primary to metastatic lesions. This study suggests, supported by both preclinical and clinical data, that stathmin could be a predictive biomarker for response to paclitaxel treatment in endometrial cancer. Re-assessment of stathmin level in metastatic lesions prior to treatment start may be relevant. Also, validation in a randomized clinical trial will be important.",cancer
1735,Energy-Looping Nanoparticles: Harnessing Excited-State Absorption for Deep-Tissue Imaging.,"Near infrared (NIR) microscopy enables noninvasive imaging in tissue, particularly in the NIR-II spectral range (1000-1400 nm) where attenuation due to tissue scattering and absorption is minimized. Lanthanide-doped upconverting nanocrystals are promising deep-tissue imaging probes due to their photostable emission in the visible and NIR, but these materials are not efficiently excited at NIR-II wavelengths due to the dearth of lanthanide ground-state absorption transitions in this window. Here, we develop a class of lanthanide-doped imaging probes that harness an energy-looping mechanism that facilitates excitation at NIR-II wavelengths, such as 1064 nm, that are resonant with excited-state absorption transitions but not ground-state absorption. Using computational methods and combinatorial screening, we have identified Tm(3+)-doped NaYF4 nanoparticles as efficient looping systems that emit at 800 nm under continuous-wave excitation at 1064 nm. Using this benign excitation with standard confocal microscopy, energy-looping nanoparticles (ELNPs) are imaged in cultured mammalian cells and through brain tissue without autofluorescence. The 1 mm imaging depths and 2 μm feature sizes are comparable to those demonstrated by state-of-the-art multiphoton techniques, illustrating that ELNPs are a promising class of NIR probes for high-fidelity visualization in cells and tissue.",nonCancer
1458,Which Medical Institution Should Perform Gatekeeping in Rural China? Results from a Cross-Sectional Study.,"Background: China's healthcare system is developing very fast but needs a regulatory practice, which helps to improve effectiveness and efficiency. This is a problem in rural China, in particular. The government is promoting a providing system with gatekeeping and mandatory referral procedures in order to limit resulting problems. However, there exists little evidence, which of the primary healthcare facilities in rural China should be given these functions. Objective: It is this study's objective to determine the impact of the specific medical institution of an initial visit on the patients' following move through the healthcare system. On that reason, we want to find evidence which level of primary health sectors in rural China is more appropriate to perform gatekeeping and to integrate care based on referrals. The alternatives are either to prefer village clinics or township health centers. Methods: The data were collected through a cross-sectional study in 2012, which used a stratified random sampling method to select 4 counties. 420 patients who wanted to see the doctors more than 3 times during the past 6 months were included as the study sample. We described the patients' move through the healthcare system by measuring the density, dispersion and sequence of visits according to the Continuity of Care model (COC). The logistic regression model was used to determine the influence of medical institution of initial visit on patients' moves after controlling other variables. Results: We found that patients who chose the county hospital as medical institution for their initial visit had 5.88 times of the odds of high (vs. low) density, 4.17 times the odds of high (vs. low) dispersion, and 2.86 times the odds of high (vs. low) sequence of visits than those choosing village clinics as medical institution for the initial visit. However, patients choosing the county hospitals as medical institution of initial visit did not report higher density, dispersion or sequence of visit than the patients who chose the township health centers. Conclusion: For the overwhelming majority of rural areas in China, the township health centers are more appropriate to perform the gatekeeping role than village clinics are. We see that as the conclusion at least at the present stage of the system's development.",nonCancer
1927,Hypoxia promotes glioma-associated macrophage infiltration via periostin and subsequent M2 polarization by upregulating TGF-beta and M-CSFR.,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are enriched in gliomas and help create a tumor-immunosuppressive microenvironment. A distinct M2-skewed type of macrophages makes up the majority of glioma TAMs, and these cells exhibit pro-tumor functions. Gliomas contain large hypoxic areas, and the presence of a correlation between the density of M2-polarized TAMs and hypoxic areas suggests that hypoxia plays a supportive role during TAM recruitment and induction. Here, we investigated the effects of hypoxia on human macrophage recruitment and M2 polarization. We also investigated the influence of the HIF inhibitor acriflavine (ACF) on M2 TAM infiltration and tumor progression in vivo. We found that hypoxia increased periostin (POSTN) expression in glioma cells and promoted the recruitment of macrophages. Hypoxia-inducible POSTN expression was increased by TGF-α via the RTK/PI3K pathway, and this effect was blocked by treating hypoxic cells with ACF. We also demonstrated that both a hypoxic environment and hypoxia-treated glioma cell supernatants were capable of polarizing macrophages toward a M2 phenotype. ACF partially reversed the M2 polarization of macrophages by inhibiting the upregulation of M-CSFR in macrophages and TGF-β in glioma cells under hypoxic conditions. Administering ACF also ablated tumor progression in vivo. Our findings reveal a mechanism that underlies hypoxia-induced TAM enrichment and M2 polarization and suggest that pharmacologically inhibiting HIFs may reduce M2-polarized TAM infiltration and glioma progression.",nonCancer
1211,Epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutations and increased copy numbers predict gefitinib sensitivity in patients with recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer.,"To evaluate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and copy number as predictors of clinical outcome in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving gefitinib. Sixty-six patients with NSCLC who experienced relapse after surgery and received gefitinib were included. Direct sequencing of exons 18 to 24 of EGFR and exons 18 to 24 of ERBB2 was performed using DNA extracted from surgical specimens. Pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed to analyze the allelic pattern and copy number of EGFR. Thirty-nine patients (59%) had EGFR mutations; 20 patients had deletional mutations in exon 19, 17 patients had missense mutations (L858R) in exon 21, and two patients had missense mutations (G719S or G719C) in exon 18. No mutations were identified in ERBB2. Response rate (82% [32 of 39 patients] v 11% [three of 27 patients]; P < .0001), time to progression (TTP; median, 12.6 v 1.7 months; P < .0001), and overall survival (median, 20.4 v 6.9 months; P = .0001) were significantly better in patients with EGFR mutations than in patients with wild-type EGFR. Increased EGFR copy numbers (> or = 3/cell) were observed in 29 patients (44%) and were significantly associated with a higher response rate (72% [21 of 29 patients] v 38% [14 of 37 patients]; P = .005) and a longer TTP (median, 9.4 v 2.6 months; P = .038). High EGFR copy numbers (> or = 6/cell) were caused by selective amplification of mutant alleles. EGFR mutations and increased copy numbers were significantly associated with better clinical outcome in gefitinib-treated NSCLC patients.",cancer
505,DNA methyltransferase 1 as a predictive biomarker and potential therapeutic target for chemotherapy in gastric cancer.,"DNA methylation contributes to carcinogenesis by mediating transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodelling, which may influence the effect of DNA-damaging drugs. We examined the prognostic and predictive impact of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) 1 and 3b expression in gastric carcinomas (GC) treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro, DNMT1 expression and chemosensitivity were investigated for a functional relationship and the DNMT inhibitor decitabine (DAC) was tested as an alternative treatment option. DNMT1/3b expression was analysed immunohistochemically in 127 pretherapeutic biopsies of neoadjuvant (platinum/5-fluorouracil)-treated GC patients and correlated with response and overall survival (OS). Short hairpin RNA technology was used to knockdown DNMT1 in the GC cell line, AGS. The chemosensitivity of GC cell lines to DAC alone and to DAC in combination with cisplatin was analysed by XTT or colony formation assays. High DNMT1 and DNMT3b expression was found in 105/127 (83%) and 79/127 (62%) carcinomas, respectively. Patients with low DNMT1 expression demonstrated a significantly better histopathological/clinical response (P=0.03/P=0.008) and OS (P(log-rank)=0.001). In vitro, knockdown of DNMT1 caused an increased chemosensitivity towards cisplatin. Combined treatment with cisplatin and DAC showed a synergistic effect leading to increased cytotoxicity in the cisplatin-resistant cell line AGS. Low DNMT1 expression defines a subgroup of GC patients with better outcomes following platinum/5FU-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In vitro data support a functional relationship between DNMT1 and cisplatin sensitivity. Besides its potential use as a predictive biomarker, DNMT1 may represent a promising target for alternative therapeutic strategies for a subset of GC patients.",cancer
1027,Germline PTPRD mutations in Ewing sarcoma: biologic and clinical implications.,"Ewing sarcoma occurs in children, adolescents and young adults. High STAT3 levels have been reported in approximately 50% of patients with Ewing sarcoma, and may be important in tumorigenesis. Protein tyrosine phosphatase delta (PTPRD) is a tumor suppressor that inhibits STAT3 activation. To date, while somatic mutations in PTPRD have been reported in diverse tumors, germline mutations of PTPRD have not been investigated in Ewing sarcoma or other cancers. We identified a novel germline mutation in the PTPRD gene in three of eight patients (37.5%) with metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Although the functional impact in two of the patients is unclear, in one of them the aberration was annotated as a W775stop germline mutation, and would be expected to lead to gene truncation and, hence, loss of the STAT3 dephosphorylation function of PTPRD. Since STAT3 is phosphorylated after being recruited to the insulin growth factor receptor (IGF-1R), suppression of IGF-1R could attenuate the enhanced STAT3 activation expected in the presence of PTPRD mutations. Of interest, two of three patients with germline PTPRD mutations achieved durable complete responses following treatment with IGF-1R monoclonal antibody-based therapies. Our pilot data suggest that PTPRD germline mutations may play a role in the development of Ewing sarcoma, a disease of young people, and their presence may have implications for therapy.",cancer

Responses and overall survival were evaluated in a series of patients presenting between March 1, 2005 and December 31, 2010. MDR1 gene C3435T polymorphisms were genotyped using peripheral blood with real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and relationships between the MDR1 C3435T genetic polymorphism and response rate of chemotherapy were analyzed by SPSS 13.0. Overall response to chemotherapy in the eligible 103 patients was 21.4%. Patients with C/C genotype in MDR1 codon 3435 had a significantly higher response rate (24.5%) than those for C/T(19.0%) and T/T(12.5%) (P<0.05). The overall median survival time (MST) of patients was 19 months, values with C/C, C/T and T/T genotype were 21, 15.5 and 17 months, respectively (P=0.487). Our research suggested that patents with the C/C genotype in MDR1 codon 3435 could be more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy than patients with C/T and T/T; however, no significant difference was found between overall survival and MDR1 codon 3435 genetic polymorphisms.",cancer
570,Crizotinib therapy for advanced lung adenocarcinoma and a ROS1 rearrangement: results from the EUROS1 cohort.,"Approximately 1% of lung adenocarcinomas are driven by oncogenic ROS1 rearrangement. Crizotinib is a potent inhibitor of both ROS1 and ALK kinase domains. In the absence of a prospective clinical trial in Europe, we conducted a retrospective study in centers that tested for ROS1 rearrangement. Eligible patients had stage IV lung adenocarcinoma, had ROS1 rearrangement according to fluorescent in situ hybridization, and had received crizotinib therapy through an individual off-label use. Best response was assessed locally using RECIST (version 1.1). All other data were analyzed centrally. We identified 32 eligible patients. One patient was excluded because next-generation sequencing was negative for ROS1 fusion. Median age was 50.5 years, 64.5% of patients were women, and 67.7% were never-smokers. Thirty patients were evaluable for progression-free survival (PFS), and 29 patients were evaluable for best response. We observed four patients with disease progression, two patients with stable disease, and objective response in 24 patients, including five complete responses (overall response rate, 80%; disease control rate, 86.7%). Median PFS was 9.1 months, and the PFS rate at 12 months was 44%. No unexpected adverse effects were observed. Twenty-six patients received pemetrexed (either alone or in combination with platinum and either before or after crizotinib) and had a response rate of 57.7% and a median PFS of 7.2 months. Crizotinib was highly active at treating lung cancer in patients with a ROS1 rearrangement, suggesting that patients with lung adenocarcinomas should be tested for ROS1. Prospective clinical trials with crizotinib and other ROS1 inhibitors are ongoing or planned.",cancer
2053,Structure of an Inward Proton-Transporting Anabaena Sensory Rhodopsin Mutant: Mechanistic Insights.,"Microbial rhodopsins are light-activated, seven-α-helical, retinylidene transmembrane proteins that have been identified in thousands of organisms across archaea, bacteria, fungi, and algae. Although they share a high degree of sequence identity and thus similarity in structure, many unique functions have been discovered and characterized among them. Some function as outward proton pumps, some as inward chloride pumps, whereas others function as light sensors or ion channels. Unique among the microbial rhodopsins characterized thus far, Anabaena sensory rhodopsin (ASR) is a photochromic sensor that interacts with a soluble 14-kDa cytoplasmic transducer that is encoded on the same operon. The sensor itself stably interconverts between all-trans-15-anti and 13-cis-15-syn retinal forms depending on the wavelength of illumination, although only the former participates in a photocycle with a signaling M intermediate. A mutation in the cytoplasmic half-channel of the protein, replacing Asp217 with Glu (D217E), results in the creation of a light-driven, single-photon, inward proton transporter. We present the 2.3 Å structure of dark-adapted D217E ASR, which reveals significant changes in the water network surrounding Glu217, as well as a shift in the carbon backbone near retinal-binding Lys210, illustrating a possible pathway leading to the protonation of Glu217 in the cytoplasmic half-channel, located 15 Å from the Schiff base. Crystallographic evidence for the protonation of nearby Glu36 is also discussed, which was described previously by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis. Finally, two histidine residues near the extracellular surface and their possible role in proton uptake are discussed.",nonCancer
1174,"Afatinib versus placebo for patients with advanced, metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer after failure of erlotinib, gefitinib, or both, and one or two lines of chemotherapy (LUX-Lung 1): a phase 2b/3 randomised trial.","Afatinib, an irreversible ErbB-family blocker, has shown preclinical activity when tested in EGFR mutant models with mutations that confer resistance to EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We aimed to assess its efficacy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with previous treatment failure on EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. In this phase 2b/3 trial, we enrolled patients with stage IIIB or IV adenocarcinoma and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance (ECOG) performance score of 0-2 who had received one or two previous chemotherapy regimens and had disease progression after at least 12 weeks of treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. We used a computer-generated sequence to randomly allocate patients (2:1) to either afatinib (50 mg per day) or placebo; all patients received best supportive care. Randomisation was done in blocks of three and was stratified by sex and baseline ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2). Investigators, patients, and the trial sponsor were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was overall survival (from date of randomisation to death), analysed on an intention-to-treat basis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00656136. Between May 26, 2008, and Sept 21, 2009, we identified 697 patients, 585 of whom were randomly allocated to treatment (390 to afatinib, 195 to placebo). Median overall survival was 10·8 months (95% CI 10·0-12·0) in the afatinib group and 12·0 months (10·2-14·3) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1·08, 95% CI 0·86-1·35; p=0·74). Median progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group (3·3 months, 95% CI 2·79-4·40) than it was in the placebo group (1·1 months, 0·95-1·68; hazard ratio 0·38, 95% CI 0·31-0·48; p<0·0001). No complete responses to treatment were noted; 29 (7%) patients had a partial response in the afatinib group, as did one patient in the placebo group. Subsequent cancer treatment was given to 257 (68%) patients in the afatinib group and 153 (79%) patients in the placebo group. The most common adverse events in the afatinib group were diarrhoea (339 [87%] of 390 patients; 66 [17%] were grade 3) and rash or acne (305 [78%] patients; 56 [14%] were grade 3). These events occurred less often in the placebo group (18 [9%] of 195 patients had diarrhoea; 31 [16%] had rash or acne), all being grade 1 or 2. Drug-related serious adverse events occurred in 39 (10%) patients in the afatinib group and one (<1%) patient in the placebo group. We recorded two possibly treatment-related deaths in the afatinib group. Although we recorded no benefit in terms of overall survival with afatinib (which might have been affected by cancer treatments given after progression in both groups), our findings for progression-free survival and response to treatment suggest that afatinib could be of some benefit to patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma who have failed at least 12 weeks of previous EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor treatment.

243,RUNX1 mutations are associated with poor outcome in younger and older patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and with distinct gene and MicroRNA expression signatures.,"To determine the association of RUNX1 mutations with therapeutic outcome in younger and older patients with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) and with gene/microRNA expression signatures. Younger (< 60 years; n = 175) and older (≥ 60 years; n = 225) patients with CN-AML treated with intensive cytarabine/anthracycline-based first-line therapy on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols were centrally analyzed for RUNX1 mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing and for established prognostic gene mutations. Gene/microRNA expression profiles were derived using microarrays. RUNX1 mutations were found in 8% and 16% of younger and older patients, respectively (P = .02). They were associated with ASXL1 mutations (P < .001) and inversely associated with NPM1 (P < .001) and CEBPA (P = .06) mutations. RUNX1-mutated patients had lower complete remission rates (P = .005 in younger; P = .006 in older) and shorter disease-free survival (P = .058 in younger; P < .001 in older), overall survival (P = .003 in younger; P < .001 in older), and event-free survival (P < .001 for younger and older) than RUNX1 wild-type patients. Because RUNX1 mutations were more common in older patients and almost never coexisted with NPM1 mutations, RUNX1 mutation-associated expression signatures were derived in older, NPM1 wild-type patients and featured upregulation of genes normally expressed in primitive hematopoietic cells and B-cell progenitors, including DNTT, BAALC, BLNK, CD109, RBPMS, and FLT3, and downregulation of promoters of myelopoiesis, including CEBPA and miR-223. RUNX1 mutations are twice as common in older than younger patients with CN-AML and negatively impact outcome in both age groups. RUNX1-mutated blasts have molecular features of primitive hematopoietic and lymphoid progenitors, potentially leading to novel therapeutic approaches.",cancer
564,"Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer (ToGA): a phase 3, open-label, randomised controlled trial.","Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody against human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; also known as ERBB2), was investigated in combination with chemotherapy for first-line treatment of HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer. ToGA (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer) was an open-label, international, phase 3, randomised controlled trial undertaken in 122 centres in 24 countries. Patients with gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer were eligible for inclusion if their tumours showed overexpression of HER2 protein by immunohistochemistry or gene amplification by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive a chemotherapy regimen consisting of capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cisplatin given every 3 weeks for six cycles or chemotherapy in combination with intravenous trastuzumab. Allocation was by block randomisation stratified by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, chemotherapy regimen, extent of disease, primary cancer site, and measurability of disease, implemented with a central interactive voice recognition system. The primary endpoint was overall survival in all randomised patients who received study medication at least once. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01041404. 594 patients were randomly assigned to study treatment (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, n=298; chemotherapy alone, n=296), of whom 584 were included in the primary analysis (n=294; n=290). Median follow-up was 18.6 months (IQR 11-25) in the trastuzumab plus chemotherapy group and 17.1 months (9-25) in the chemotherapy alone group. Median overall survival was 13.8 months (95% CI 12-16) in those assigned to trastuzumab plus chemotherapy compared with 11.1 months (10-13) in those assigned to chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.60-0.91; p=0.0046). The most common adverse events in both groups were nausea (trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, 197 [67%] vs chemotherapy alone, 184 [63%]), vomiting (147 [50%] vs 134 [46%]), and neutropenia (157 [53%] vs 165 [57%]). Rates of overall grade 3 or 4 adverse events (201 [68%] vs 198 [68%]) and cardiac adverse events (17 [6%] vs 18 [6%]) did not differ between groups. Trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy can be considered as a new standard option for patients with HER2-positive advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.

895,Dissecting therapeutic resistance to RAF inhibition in melanoma by tumor genomic profiling.,"A detailed understanding of the mechanisms by which tumors acquire resistance to targeted anticancer agents should speed the development of treatment strategies with lasting clinical efficacy. RAF inhibition in BRAF-mutant melanoma exemplifies the promise and challenge of many targeted drugs; although response rates are high, resistance invariably develops. Here, we articulate overarching principles of resistance to kinase inhibitors, as well as a translational approach to characterize resistance in the clinical setting through tumor mutation profiling. As a proof of principle, we performed targeted, massively parallel sequencing of 138 cancer genes in a tumor obtained from a patient with melanoma who developed resistance to PLX4032 after an initial dramatic response. The resulting profile identified an activating mutation at codon 121 in the downstream kinase MEK1 that was absent in the corresponding pretreatment tumor. The MEK1(C121S) mutation was shown to increase kinase activity and confer robust resistance to both RAF and MEK inhibition in vitro. Thus, MEK1(C121S) or functionally similar mutations are predicted to confer resistance to combined MEK/RAF inhibition. These results provide an instructive framework for assessing mechanisms of acquired resistance to kinase inhibition and illustrate the use of emerging technologies in a manner that may accelerate personalized cancer medicine.",cancer
725,Safety and activity of alectinib against systemic disease and brain metastases in patients with crizotinib-resistant ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (AF-002JG): results from the dose-finding portion of a phase 1/2 study.,"Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and ALK rearrangements generally have a progression-free survival of 8-11 months while on treatment with the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. However, resistance inevitably develops, with the brain a common site of progression. More potent ALK inhibitors with consistently demonstrable CNS activity and good tolerability are needed urgently. Alectinib is a novel, highly selective, and potent ALK inhibitor that has shown clinical activity in patients with crizotinib-naive ALK-rearranged NSCLC. We did a phase 1/2 study of alectinib to establish the recommended phase 2 dose of the drug and examine its activity in patients resistant or intolerant to crizotinib. We enrolled patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who progressed on or were intolerant to crizotinib. We administered various oral doses of alectinib (300-900 mg twice a day) during the dose-escalation portion of the study (phase 1), to ascertain the recommended dose for phase 2. We used Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria (version 1.1) to investigate the activity of alectinib in all patients with a baseline scan and at least one post-treatment scan (CT or MRI), with central radiological review of individuals with brain metastases. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of alectinib. Here, we present data for the phase 1 portion of the study, the primary objective of which was to establish the recommended phase 2 dose; phase 2 is ongoing. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01588028. 47 patients were enrolled. Alectinib was well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being fatigue (14 [30%]; all grade 1-2), myalgia (eight [17%]; all grade 1-2), and peripheral oedema (seven [15%] grade 1-2, one [2%] grade 3). Dose-limiting toxic effects were recorded in two patients in the cohort receiving alectinib 900 mg twice a day; one individual had grade 3 headache and the other had grade 3 neutropenia. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events were increased levels of γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (two [4%]), a reduction in the number of neutrophils (two [4%]), and hypophosphataemia (two [4%]). Three patients reported four grade 4 serious adverse events that were deemed unrelated to alectinib: acute renal failure; pleural effusion and pericardial effusion; and brain metastasis. At data cut-off (median follow-up 126 days [IQR 84-217]), 44 patients could be assessed for activity. Investigator-assessed objective responses were noted in 24 (55%) patients, with a confirmed complete response in one (2%), a confirmed partial response in 14 (32%), and an unconfirmed partial response in nine (20%). 16 (36%) patients had stable disease; the remaining four (9%) had progressive disease. Of 21 patients with CNS metastases at baseline, 11 (52%) had an objective response; six (29%) had a complete response (three unconfirmed) and five (24%) had a partial response (one unconfirmed); eight (38%) patients had stable disease and the remaining two (10%) had progressive disease. Pharmacokinetic data indicated that mean exposure (AUC0-10) after multiple doses of alectinib (300-600 mg twice a day) was dose-dependent. Alectinib was well tolerated, with promising antitumour activity in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC resistant to crizotinib, including those with CNS metastases. On the basis of activity, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic data, we chose alectinib 600 mg twice a day as the recommended dose for phase 2. Chugai Pharmaceuticals, F Hoffmann La-Roche.",cancer
910,Response to angiotensin blockade with irbesartan in a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer.,"A patient suffering from metastatic colorectal cancer, treatment-related toxicity and resistance to standard chemotherapy and radiation was assessed as part of a personalized oncogenomics initiative to derive potential alternative therapeutic strategies. Whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing was used to interrogate a metastatic tumor refractory to standard treatments of a patient with mismatch repair-deficient metastatic colorectal cancer. Integrative genomic analysis indicated overexpression of the AP-1 transcriptional complex suggesting experimental therapeutic rationales, including blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. This led to the repurposing of the angiotensin II receptor antagonist, irbesartan, as an anticancer therapy, resulting in the patient experiencing a dramatic and durable response. This case highlights the utility of comprehensive integrative genomic profiling and bioinformatics analysis to provide hypothetical rationales for personalized treatment options.",cancer
750,Inhibition of activated fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 in endometrial cancer cells induces cell death despite PTEN abrogation.,"KRAS activation and PTEN inactivation are frequent events in endometrial tumorigenesis, occurring in 10% to 30% and 26% to 80% of endometrial cancers, respectively. Because we have recently shown activating mutations in fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) in 16% of endometrioid endometrial cancers, we sought to determine the genetic context in which FGFR2 mutations occur. Analysis of 116 primary endometrioid endometrial cancers revealed that FGFR2 and KRAS mutations were mutually exclusive, whereas FGFR2 mutations were seen concomitantly with PTEN mutations. Here, we show that shRNA knockdown of FGFR2 or treatment with a pan-FGFR inhibitor, PD173074, resulted in cell cycle arrest and induction of cell death in endometrial cancer cells with activating mutations in FGFR2. This cell death in response to FGFR2 inhibition occurred within the context of loss-of-function mutations in PTEN and constitutive AKT phosphorylation, and was associated with a marked reduction in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Together, these data suggest that inhibition of FGFR2 may be a viable therapeutic option in endometrial tumors possessing activating mutations in FGFR2, despite the frequent abrogation of PTEN in this cancer type.",cancer
1092,Low-Dose Histone Deacetylase Inhibitor Treatment Leads to Tumor Growth Arrest and Multi-Lineage Differentiation of Malignant Rhabdoid Tumors.,"Malignant rhabdoid tumor (MRT) and atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) are rare aggressive undifferentiated tumors primarily affecting the kidney and CNS of infants and young children. MRT are almost exclusively characterized by homozygous deletion or inactivation of the chromatin remodeling gene SMARCB1 SMARCB1 protein loss leads to direct impairment of chromatin remodeling and we have previously reported a role for this protein in histone acetylation. This provided the rationale for investigating the therapeutic potential of histone deactylase inhibitors (HDACi) in MRT. Whereas previously HDACis have been used at doses and schedules that induce cytotoxicity, in the current studies we have tested the hypothesis, both in vitro and in vivo, that sustained treatment of human MRT with low-dose HDACi can lead to sustained cell growth arrest and differentiation. Sustained low-dose panobinostat (LBH589) treatment led to changes in cellular morphology associated with a marked increase in the induction of neural, renal, and osteoblast differentiation pathways. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling highlighted differential gene expression supporting multilineage differentiation. Using mouse xenograft models, sustained low-dose LBH589 treatment caused tumor growth arrest associated with tumor calcification detectable by X-ray imaging. Histological analysis of LBH589-treated tumors revealed significant regions of ossification, confirmed by Alizarin Red staining. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased TUJ1 and PAX2 staining suggestive of neuronal and renal differentiation, respectively. Low-dose HDACi treatment can terminally differentiate MRT tumor cells and reduce their ability to self-renew. The use of low-dose HDACi as a novel therapeutic approach warrants further investigation.

641,Prognostic and Predictive Effect of TP53 Mutations in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer from Adjuvant Cisplatin-Based Therapy Randomized Trials: A LACE-Bio Pooled Analysis.,"Tumor protein p53 gene (TP53) mutations are common in stage I through III non-small cell lung cancer, but clinical trials have shown inconsistent results regarding their relationship to the effects of adjuvant therapy. The objective is to clarify their putative prognostic and predictive effects. A pooled analysis of TP53 mutations (exons 5-8) was conducted in four randomized trials (the International Adjuvant Lung Cancer Trial, J BRonchus 10, Cancer and Leukemia Group B-9633, and Adjuvant Navelbine International Trialist Association trial) of platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) versus observation (OBS). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of mutant versus wild-type (WT) TP53 for overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated using a multivariable Cox model stratified on trial and adjusted on sex, age, and clinicopathological variables. Predictive value was evaluated with an interaction between treatment and TP53. A total of 1209 patients (median follow-up 5.5 years) were included. There were 573 deaths (47%) and 653 DFS events (54%). Mutations (434 [36%]) had no prognostic effect (OBS HROS = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.77-1.28, p = 0.95; HRDFS = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.78-1.25, p = 0.92) but were marginally predictive of benefit from ACT for OS (test for interaction: OS, p = 0.06; DFS, p = 0.11). Patients with WT TP53 had a tendency toward better outcomes with ACT than did those in the OBS group (HROS = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.95, p = 0.02; HRDFS = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.92, p = 0.005). In the ACT arm, a deleterious effect of mutant versus WT TP53 was observed (HROS = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.10-1.78, p = 0.006; HRDFS = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.04-1.64, p = 0.02). TP53 mutation had no prognostic effect but was marginally predictive for survival from ACT. In patients who received ACT, TP53 mutation tended to be associated with shorter survival than wild-type TP53.",cancer
204,Therapeutic targeting of a robust non-oncogene addiction to PRKDC in ATM-defective tumors.,"When the integrity of the genome is threatened, cells activate a complex, kinase-based signaling network to arrest the cell cycle, initiate DNA repair, or, if the extent of damage is beyond repair capacity, induce apoptotic cell death. The ATM protein lies at the heart of this signaling network, which is collectively referred to as the DNA damage response (DDR). ATM is involved in numerous DDR-regulated cellular responses-cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apoptosis. Disabling mutations in the gene encoding ATM occur frequently in various human tumors, including lung cancer and hematological malignancies. We report that ATM deficiency prevents apoptosis in human and murine cancer cells exposed to genotoxic chemotherapy. Using genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate in vitro and in vivo that ATM-defective cells display strong non-oncogene addiction to DNA-PKcs (DNA-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit). Further, this dependence of ATM-defective cells on DNA-PKcs offers a window of opportunity for therapeutic intervention: We show that pharmacological or genetic abrogation of DNA-PKcs in ATM-defective cells leads to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks and the subsequent CtBP-interacting protein (CtIP)-dependent generation of large single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) repair intermediates. These ssDNA structures trigger proapoptotic signaling through the RPA/ATRIP/ATR/Chk1/p53/Puma axis, ultimately leading to the apoptotic demise of ATM-defective cells exposed to DNA-PKcs inhibitors. Finally, we demonstrate that DNA-PKcs inhibitors are effective as single agents against ATM-defective lymphomas in vivo. Together, our data implicate DNA-PKcs as a drug target for the treatment of ATM-defective malignancies.",cancer

HNSCC has long been a treatment challenge because of the high rate of recurrences and of advanced disease at the time of diagnosis. Molecular identification of tissue biomarkers in diagnostic biopsy specimens may not only identify patients at risk for developing HNSCC but may also select patients that may benefit from more aggressive treatment modalities. Several biomarkers studied to date such as the proteins p53, cyclin D1, p16, Cox-2 enzyme, epidermal growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, matrix metalloproteinases and the Fhit marker for genomic instability could be manipulated for the therapeutic benefit of these patients. This review presents the most updated information on molecular biomarkers with the greatest prognostic potential in HNSCC and discusses some factors that contribute to the controversy concerning their prognostic importance.",cancer
151,Lack of prognostic significance of p53 and K-ras mutations in primary resected non-small-cell lung cancer on E4592: a Laboratory Ancillary Study on an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Prospective Randomized Trial of Postoperative Adjuvant Therapy.,"To determine the prognostic and predictive significance of p53 and K-ras mutations in patients with completely resected non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients were randomized preoperatively to receive adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy (Arm A) or radiotherapy plus concurrent chemotherapy (Arm B). p53 protein expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and p53 mutations in exons 5 to 8 were evaluated by single-strand conformational analysis. K-ras mutations in codons 12, 13, and 61 were determined using engineered restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Four hundred eighty-eight patients were entered onto E3590; 197 tumors were assessable for analysis. Neither presence nor absence of p53 mutations, p53 protein expression, or K-ras mutations correlated with survival or progression-free survival. There was a trend toward improved survival for patients with wildtype K-ras (median, 42 months) compared with survival of patients with mutant K-ras who were randomized to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (median, 25 months; P = .09). Multivariate analysis revealed only age and tumor stage to be significant prognostic factors, although there was a trend bordering on statistical significance for K-ras (P = .066). Analysis of survival difference by p53 by single-stranded conformational polymorphism and IHC, interaction of p53 and K-ras, interaction of p53 and treatment arm, nodal station, extent of surgery, weight loss, and histology did not reach statistical significance. p53 mutations and protein overexpression are not significant prognostic or predictive factors in resected stage II or IIIA NSCLC. K-ras mutations may be a weak prognostic marker. p53 or K-ras should not be routinely used in the clinical management of these patients.",cancer

To evaluate their prognostic significance, 67 adult patients with CBFL were analyzed to ascertain the c-KIT mutation status. In acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with t(8;21), the presence of c-KIT TKD mutation at codon 816 (TKD(816)) was associated with a high white blood cell count at diagnosis (median, 29.60 x 10(9)/L) and a higher incidence (33%) of extramedullary leukemia (EML) during the course of the disease. Data also showed that the TKD(816) mutated patients (n = 12) had a significantly higher incidence of relapse and a lower overall survival (OS) at 24 months, compared with the 17 c-KIT unmutated (c-KIT(-)) patients (90% vs 35.3%, P = .002; 25% vs 76.5%, P = .006, respectively). No difference in relapse incidence (P = .126) and OS (P = .474) was observed between the c-KIT mutated other than TKD(816) (n = 7) and the c-KIT(-) patients. These findings indicate that c-KIT TKD(816) mutation has a negative impact on the outcome of AML with t(8;21).",cancer

We hypothesize that epigenetic processes underlie carcinogenesis. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of smoke exposure on DNA methylation to search for novel susceptibility loci. We obtained epigenome-wide DNA methylation data from lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell (LUSC) tissues in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We performed a two-stage discovery (n = 326) and validation (n = 185) analysis to investigate the association of epigenetic DNA methylation level with cigarette smoking pack-years. We also externally validated our findings in an independent dataset. Linear model with least square estimator and spline regression were performed to examine the association between DNA methylation and smoking. We identified five CpG sites highly associated with pack-years of cigarette smoking. Smoking was negatively associated with methylation levels in cg25771041 (WWTR1, p = 3.6 × 10-9), cg16200496 (NFIX, p = 3.4 × 10-12), cg22515201 (PLA2G6, p = 1.0 × 10-9) and cg24823993 (NHP2L1, p = 5.1 × 10-8) and positively associated with the methylation level in cg11875268 (SMUG1, p = 4.3 × 10-8). The CpG-smoking association was stronger in LUSC than LUAD. Of the five loci, smoking explained the most variation in cg16200496 (R2 = 0.098 [both types] and 0.144 [LUSC]). We identified 5 novel CpG candidates that demonstrate differential methylation patterns associated with smoke exposure in lung neoplasms.",nonCancer

The randomized phase III clinical trial E2603: carboplatin, paclitaxel, ± sorafenib (CP vs. CPS) offers a large collection of tumor samples to evaluate association of somatic mutations, genomic alterations, and clinical outcomes, prior to current FDA-approved therapies. Copy number and mutational analysis on 119 pretreatment samples was performed. CPS therapy was associated with improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with RAF1 (cRAF) gene copy gains (HR, 0.372; P = 0.025) or CCND1 gene copy gains (HR, 0.45; P = 0.035). CPS therapy was associated with improved overall survival (OS) compared with CP in patients with tumors with KRAS gene copy gains (HR, 0.25; P = 0.035). BRAF gene copy gain and MET amplification were more common in samples with V600K versus V600E mutations (P < 0.001), which was validated in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. We observed improved treatment response with CPS in patients with melanoma whose tumors have RAF1 (cRAF), KRAS, or CCND1 amplification, all of which can be attributed to sorafenib targeting CRAF. These genomic alterations should be incorporated in future studies for evaluation as biomarkers.",cancer
2014,Circadian clock components RORα and Bmal1 mediate the anti-proliferative effect of MLN4924 in osteosarcoma cells.,"The anticancer small molecule MLN4924, a Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, triggers cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and senescence in cancer cells. In this study, we demonstrate that MLN4924 suppresses osteosarcoma cell proliferation by inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Our results indicate that MLN4924 stabilizes the retinoid orphan nuclear receptor alpha (RORα) by decreasing its ubiquitination. RNA interference of RORα attenuates the anti-proliferative effect of MLN4924 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. MLN4924 up-regulates the expression of p21 and Bmal1, two transcriptional targets of RORα. However, p21 plays a minimal role in the anti-proliferative effect of MLN4924 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. In contrast, Bmal1 suppression by siRNA attenuates the anti-proliferative effect of MLN4924 in U2OS osteosarcoma cells, indicating that the MLN4924-mediated cell growth inhibition is mediated by Bmal1. These results show MLN4924 to be a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of osteosarcoma and suggest that MLN4924-induced tumor growth inhibition is mediated by the circadian clock components RORα and Bmal1.",nonCancer
107,PIK3CA and AKT1 mutations have distinct effects on sensitivity to targeted pathway inhibitors in an isogenic luminal breast cancer model system.,"Activating mutations in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway are present in the majority of breast cancers and therefore are a major focus of drug development and clinical trials. Pathway mutations have been proposed as predictive biomarkers for efficacy of PI3K-targeted therapies. However, the precise contribution of distinct PI3K pathway mutations to drug sensitivity is unknown. We describe the creation of a physiologic human luminal breast cancer cell line model to study the phenotype of these mutations using the MCF-7 cell line. We used somatic cell gene targeting to ""correct"" PIK3CA E545K-mutant alleles in MCF-7 cells to wild-type sequence. The AKT1 E17K hotspot mutation was knocked in on this wild-type background. Loss of mutant PIK3CA dramatically reduced phosphorylation of AKT proteins and several known AKT targets, but other AKT target proteins and downstream effectors of mTOR were not affected. PIK3CA wild-type cells exhibited reduced proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Knockin of the AKT1 E17K hotspot mutation on this PIK3CA wild-type background restored pathway signaling, proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. PIK3CA, but not AKT1 mutation, increased sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206. AKT1 E17K is a bona fide oncogene in a human luminal breast cancer context. Distinct PI3K pathway mutations confer differential sensitivity to drugs targeting the pathway at different points and by distinct mechanisms. These findings have implications for the use of tumor genome sequencing to assign patients to targeted therapies.",cancer
1509,Repression of neuronal nitric oxide (nNOS) synthesis by MTA1 is involved in oxidative stress-induced neuronal damage.,"The Metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) coregulator, an essential component of the nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase (NuRD) complex, potentiates neuroprotective effects against ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. But the underlying mechanism(s) remain largely unknown. Here, we discovered that neuronal MTA1 was a target of oxidative stress, and stimulation of neurons with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) treatment significantly inhibited MTA1 expression. Additionally, MTA1 depletion augmented ischemic oxidative stress and thus promoted oxidative stress-induced neuronal cell death by OGD. While studying the impact of MTA1 status on global neuronal gene expression, we unexpectedly discovered that MTA1 may modulate OGD-induced neuronal damage via regulation of distinct nitric oxide synthase (NOS) (namely neuronal NOS, nNOS) signaling. We provided in vitro evidence that NOS1 is a chromatin target of MTA1 in OGD-insulted neurons. Mechanistically, neuronal ischmia-mediated respression of NOS1 expression is accompanied by the enhanced recruitment of MTA1 along with histone deacetylases (HDACs) to the NOS1 promoter, which could be effectively blocked by a pharmacological inhibitor of the HDACs. These findings collectively reveal a previously unrecognized, critical homeostatic role of MTA1, both as a target and as a component of the neuronal oxidative stress, in the regulation of acute neuronal responses against brain I/R damage. Our study also provides a molecular mechanistic explanation for the previously reported neurovascular protection by selective nNOS inhibitors.",nonCancer
1503,Depinning-Induced Capillary Wave during the Sliding of a Droplet on a Textured Surface.,"Surfaces covered with hydrophobic micro-/nanoscale textures can allow water droplets to slide easily because of low contact angle hysteresis. In contrast to the case of a droplet sliding on a smooth surface, when a droplet slides on a textured surface, it must recede from the textures at its rear edge and the resultant depinning events induce a capillary wave on the surface of the droplet. Although this depinning-induced capillary wave can be observed to some extent through high-speed imaging, important parameters of the wave, such as the wavelength and frequency, and the factors that determine these parameters are not fully understood. We report direct measurements of this depinning-induced capillary wave using microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based force sensors fabricated on a textured surface. Such sensor measurements reveal the frequency of the vibration occurring on the surface of the droplet, from which it is possible to calculate the wavelength of the capillary wave. We show that the frequency and wavelength of the depinning-induced capillary wave during the sliding of a water droplet on a micropillar array depend upon neither the size of the droplet nor its sliding velocity. However, the frequency (wavelength) decreases (increases) as the pitch of the micropillar array increases. We argue that the wavelength of the depinning-induced capillary wave is equal to the maximum length of the liquid bridges that develop at the micropillars before depinning. This hypothesis is confirmed by comparing the wavelengths obtained from the sensor measurements to the maximum liquid-bridge lengths calculated from observations using a high-speed camera.",nonCancer
1624,"Patient, hospital, and local health system characteristics associated with the use of observation stays in veterans health administration hospitals, 2005 to 2012.","Recent studies have documented that a significant increase in the use of observation stays along with extensive variation in patterns of use across hospitals.The objective of this longitudinal observational study was to examine the extent to which patient, hospital, and local health system characteristics explain variation in observation stay rates across Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals.Our data came from years 2005 to 2012 of the nationwide VHA Medical SAS inpatient and enrollment files, American Hospital Association Survey, and Area Health Resource File. We used these data to estimate linear regression models of hospitals' observation stay rates as a function of hospital, patient, and local health system characteristics, while controlling for time trends and Veterans Integrated Service Network level fixed effects.We found that observation stay rates are inversely related to hospital bed size and that hospitals with a greater proportion of younger or rural patients have higher observation stay rates. Observation stay rates were nearly 15 percentage points higher in 2012 than 2005.Although we identify several characteristics associated with variation in VHA hospital observation stay rates, many factors remain unmeasured.",nonCancer
296,XRCC1 R399Q polymorphism is associated with response to platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy in bulky cervical cancer.,"The aim of the study was to assess whether the genetic polymorphisms were associated with the tumor response in patients treated with platinum-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for bulky cervical cancer. We retrospectively reviewed the clinical data and recruited paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tissues of 36 patients with bulky cervical carcinoma. All patients underwent two or three cycles of platinum-based NAC followed by radical hysterectomy. We determined the genotypes of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of ERCC1, ERCC2, GGH, GSTP1, MTHFR, SLC19A1 and XRCC1 using single base primer extension assay. The response to platinum-based NAC was higher in patients with SNP of XRCC1 R399Q (P=0.015), and there was a significant increased chance of treatment response in women with the G/G genotype (OR 38.0; 95% CI 1.66-870.45; P=0.023). The probability of response was also higher in patients with SNP of SLC19A1 6318C/T (P=0.032). There were dose-dependent influence of the number of alleles on the response to platinum-based chemotherapy (chi2 test for linear-by-linear association; P=0.009 for XRCC1 R399Q and P=0.017 for SLC19A1 6318C/T, respectively). Moreover, the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) analysis documented that the combinations of XRCC1 R399Q and GGH-401C/T genetic polymorphisms were significantly associated with response to chemotherapy (P<0.0001). Genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 R399Q is associated with response to platinum-based NAC in bulky cervical cancer, and MDR analysis documented association between gene-gene interaction of XRCC1 R399Q and treatment response.",cancer

Observational or prospective studies that reported the prevalence of antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance of E coli were selected for inclusion. No language or time restrictions were applied. We performed a meta-analysis using a random effects model to quantify the prevalence of antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance of E coli.|Ten studies were eligible for the meta-analysis, which together included a total of 2305 women with uncomplicated cystitis. The overall resistance rate to antibiotics was 0.28 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.25, 0.32). The pooled resistance rates were 0.08 (95% CI: 0.06, 0.11) for cephalosporin, 0.22 (95% CI: 0.18, 0.25) for fluoroquinolone (FQ), and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.35, 0.51) for trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Regression analysis showed that resistance to FQ is increasing (P = 0.014) and resistance to TMP/SMX is decreasing (P = 0.043) by year. The generation of cephalosporin was not a significant moderator of differences in resistance rate.|The resistance rate of FQ in Korea is over 20% and is gradually increasing. Although the resistance rate of TMP/SMX is over 40%, its tendency is in decreasing state. Antibiotic strategies used for the treatment of uncomplicated cystitis in Korea have to be modified.",nonCancer
1440,Highly sensitive Raman spectroscopy with low laser power for fast in-line reaction and multiphase flow monitoring.,"In process analytics, the applicability of Raman spectroscopy is restricted by high excitation intensities or long integration times required. In this work, a novel Raman system was developed to minimize photon flux losses. It allows specific reduc-tion of spectral resolution to enable the use of Raman spectroscopy for real-time analytics when strongly increased sensitivity is required. The performance potential of the optical setup was demonstrated in two exemplary applications: First, a fast exothermic reaction (Michael addition) was monitored with backscattering fiber optics under strongly attenuated laser power (7 mW). Second, high-speed scanning of a segmented multiphase flow (water/toluene) with sub-µL droplets was achieved by aligning the focus of a coaxial Raman probe with long focal length directly into a perfluoroalkoxy (PFA) capillary. With an acquisition rate of 333 Raman spectra per second, chemical information was obtained separately for both of the rapidly alternating phases. The experiment with reduced laser power demonstrates that the technique described in this paper is applicable in chemical production processes, especially in hazardous environments. Further potential uses can be envisioned in medical or biological applications with limited power input. The realization of high-speed measurements shows new possibilities for analysis of heterogeneous phase systems and of fast reactions or processes.",nonCancer
2331,Metabolomics of pulmonary exacerbations reveals the personalized nature of cystic fibrosis disease.,"Background. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that results in chronic infections of the lungs. CF patients experience intermittent pulmonary exacerbations (CFPE) that are associated with poor clinical outcomes. CFPE involves an increase in disease symptoms requiring more aggressive therapy. Methods. Longitudinal sputum samples were collected from 11 patients (n = 44 samples) to assess the effect of exacerbations on the sputum metabolome using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The data was analyzed with MS/MS molecular networking and multivariate statistics. Results. The individual patient source had a larger influence on the metabolome of sputum than the clinical state (exacerbation, treatment, post-treatment, or stable). Of the 4,369 metabolites detected, 12% were unique to CFPE samples; however, the only known metabolites significantly elevated at exacerbation across the dataset were platelet activating factor (PAF) and a related monacylglycerophosphocholine lipid. Due to the personalized nature of the sputum metabolome, a single patient was followed for 4.2 years (capturing four separate exacerbation events) as a case study for the detection of personalized biomarkers with metabolomics. PAF and related lipids were significantly elevated during CFPEs of this patient and ceramide was elevated during CFPE treatment. Correlating the abundance of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons to metabolomics data from the same samples during a CFPE demonstrated that antibiotics were positively correlated to Stenotrophomonas and Pseudomonas, while ceramides and other lipids were correlated with Streptococcus, Rothia, and anaerobes. Conclusions. This study identified PAF and other inflammatory lipids as potential biomarkers of CFPE, but overall, the metabolome of CF sputum was patient specific, supporting a personalized approach to molecular detection of CFPE onset.",nonCancer
1542,Neonatal Transfusion Practice: When do Neonates Need Red Blood Cells or Platelets?,"Based on small studies and not on statistically valid clinical trials, guidelines for neonatal transfusions remain controversial and practices vary greatly. Premature infants and critically ill neonates in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) often require blood transfusions and extremely preterm neonates receive at least one red blood cell transfusion during their hospital stay. Transfusions to neonates convey both benefits and risks and consequently it is imperative to establish specific guidelines to improve practice and avoid unnecessary transfusions. Appropriate and lifesaving platelet transfusion in thrombocytopenic bleeding neonates pertains to 2% of all neonates in NICUs. Inversely, 98% of platelet transfusions are given prophylactically, in the absence of bleeding, with the assumption that this reduces the risk of a serious hemorrhage. To date, no evidence base is available for assigning a platelet transfusion trigger to NICU patients. Each NICU should approve specific guidelines that best suit its local clinical practice. Therefore, whatever guidelines are chosen in deciding when to transfuse, what is most important is to adhere strictly to the guidelines adopted, thus limiting unnecessary transfusions that convey no benefits and carry both known and unknown risks.",nonCancer
2105,Morphological Characterization and Quantification of the Mycelial Growth of the Brown-Rot Fungus Postia placenta for Modeling Purposes.,"Continuous observation was performed using confocal laser scanning microscopy to visualize the three-dimensional microscopic growth of the brown-rot fungus, Postia placenta, for seventeen days. The morphological characterization of Postia placenta was quantitatively determined, including the tip extension rate, branch angle and branching length, (hyphal length between two adjacent branch sites). A voxel method has been developed to measure the growth of the biomass. Additionally, the tip extension rate distribution, the branch angle distribution and the branching length distribution, which quantified the hyphal growth characteristics, were evaluated. Statistical analysis revealed that the extension rate of tips was randomly distributed in space. The branch angle distribution did not change with the development of the colony, however, the branching length distribution did vary with the development of the colony. The experimental data will be incorporated into a lattice-based model simulating the growth of Postia placenta.",nonCancer

Imatinib mesylate is indicated in the management of gastrointestinal stromal tumor and chronic myelogeneus leukemia. There is an interest to use imatinib mesylate in the treatment of c-kit positive ESS. We reported a case of 42-year-old female low-grade ESS progressed on chemotherapy and presented with objective response to imatinib mesylate. The treatment response was evaluated with FDG PET/CT.

FDG PET, a sensitive method for tumor response evaluation on the basis of tumor metabolism changes, is useful for the evaluation of imatinib treatment in low-grade ESS.",cancer
1751,Transcriptomic Profiling Analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana Treated with Exogenous Myo-Inositol.,"Myo-insositol (MI) is a crucial substance in the growth and developmental processes in plants. It is commonly added to the culture medium to promote adventitious shoot development. In our previous work, MI was found in influencing Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. In this report, a high-throughput RNA sequencing technique (RNA-Seq) was used to investigate differently expressed genes in one-month-old Arabidopsis seedling grown on MI free or MI supplemented culture medium. The results showed that 21,288 and 21,299 genes were detected with and without MI treatment, respectively. The detected genes included 184 new genes that were not annotated in the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome. Additionally, 183 differentially expressed genes were identified (DEGs, FDR ≤0.05, log2 FC≥1), including 93 up-regulated genes and 90 down-regulated genes. The DEGs were involved in multiple pathways, such as cell wall biosynthesis, biotic and abiotic stress response, chromosome modification, and substrate transportation. Some significantly differently expressed genes provided us with valuable information for exploring the functions of exogenous MI. RNA-Seq results showed that exogenous MI could alter gene expression and signaling transduction in plant cells. These results provided a systematic understanding of the functions of exogenous MI in detail and provided a foundation for future studies.",nonCancer
466,Metastasis-associated PRL-3 induces EGFR activation and addiction in cancer cells.,"Metastasis-associated phosphatase of regenerating liver-3 (PRL-3) has pleiotropic effects in driving cancer progression, yet the signaling mechanisms of PRL-3 are still not fully understood. Here, we provide evidence for PRL-3-induced hyperactivation of EGFR and its downstream signaling cascades in multiple human cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, PRL-3-induced activation of EGFR was attributed primarily to transcriptional downregulation of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), an inhibitory phosphatase for EGFR. Functionally, PRL-3-induced hyperactivation of EGFR correlated with increased cell growth, promigratory characteristics, and tumorigenicity. Moreover, PRL-3 induced cellular addiction to EGFR signaling, as evidenced by the pronounced reversion of these oncogenic attributes upon EGFR-specific inhibition. Of clinical significance, we verified elevated PRL-3 expression as a predictive marker for favorable therapeutic response in a heterogeneous colorectal cancer (CRC) patient cohort treated with the clinically approved anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab. The identification of PRL-3-driven EGFR hyperactivation and consequential addiction to EGFR signaling opens new avenues for inhibiting PRL-3-driven cancer progression. We propose that elevated PRL-3 expression is an important clinical predictive biomarker for favorable anti-EGFR cancer therapy.",cancer

This phase I study combines buparlisib, a pan-class 1A PI3K inhibitor, with two schedules of carboplatin and paclitaxel for patients with advanced solid tumors (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01297452). There were two regimens: Group 1 received carboplatin AUC 5 and paclitaxel 175 mg/m(2), on day 1 of a 21-day cycle with pegfilgrastim support; Group 2 received carboplatin AUC 5 (day 1) and paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) (days 1, 8, and 15) on a 28-day cycle without growth factor support. In both groups, three dose levels of buparlisib were explored: 50, 80, and 100 mg/day. Primary endpoint was to identify recommended phase II doses of buparlisib in both groups. Thirty subjects enrolled, 16 in Group 1 and 14 in Group 2. The DLTs were elevated alkaline phosphatase (n = 1) and uncomplicated neutropenia (n = 2). The median numbers of cycles were 5 (Group 1) and 6 (Group 2). The MTDs for buparlisib were 100 mg/day in Group 1 and 80 mg/day in Group 2. Among 25 patients with measurable disease, the confirmed objective response rate was 20% (one complete response, four partial responses). Among three patients with known loss of PTEN expression, all derived clinical benefit from treatment. The addition of buparlisib to carboplatin + paclitaxel was well tolerated, and preliminary activity was notable against tumors with loss of PTEN expression.",cancer
2315,Novel fermented chickpea milk with enhanced level of γ-aminobutyric acid and neuroprotective effect on PC12 cells.,"In this study, novel fermented chickpea milk with high γ -aminobutyric acid (GABA) content and potential neuroprotective activity was developed. Fermentation starter that can produce GABA was selected from 377 strains of lactic acid bacteria isolated from traditional Chinese fermented foods. Among the screened strains, strain M-6 showed the highest GABA-producing capacity in De Man-Rogosa and Sharp (MRS) broth and chickpea milk. M-6 was identified as Lactobacillus plantarum based on Gram staining, API carbohydrate fermentation pattern testing, and 16s rDNA sequencing. The complete gene encoding glutamate decarboxylase was cloned to confirm the presence of the gene in L. plantarum M-6. The fermentation condition was optimized by response surface methodology. Results demonstrated that L. plantarum M-6 produced the highest GABA content of 537.23 mg/L. The optimal condition included an inoculum concentration of 7%, presence of 0.2% (m/v) monosodium glutamate and 55 µ M pyridoxal-5-phosphate, incubation temperature of 39 °C and fermentation time of 48 h .

450,Afatinib is especially effective against non-small cell lung cancer carrying an EGFR exon 19 deletion.,"A recent pooled analysis of the LUX-LUNG3 and LUX-LUNG6 trials suggested that afatinib (an irreversible epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)) is especially effective against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) carrying an EGFR exon 19 deletion. Stable viral transfectant HEK293 cell lines carrying an exon 19 deletion (HEK293/19 del) or exon 21 L858R mutation (HEK293/ L858R)) were created and their drug sensitivities to AG1478 (a reversible EGFR-TKI) and afatinib were examined using an MTT assay. Western blot analyses were performed to estimate the phosphorylation of EGFR. In the HEK293/19 del, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of afatinib was significantly lower than that in the HEK293/ L858R. In addition, afatinib inhibited the phosphorylation of EGFR to a greater degree in the HEK293/19 del than in the HEK293/L858R. Our experimental findings suggest that afatinib is especially effective against NSCLC carrying an EGFR exon 19 deletion.",cancer
267,Oncogenetics and minimal residual disease are independent outcome predictors in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"With intensified pediatric-like therapy and genetic disease dissection, the field of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has evolved recently. In this new context, we aimed to reassess the value of conventional risk factors with regard to new genetic alterations and early response to therapy, as assessed by immunoglobulin/T-cell receptor minimal residual disease (MRD) levels. The study was performed in 423 younger adults with Philadelphia chromosome-negative ALL in first remission (265 B-cell precursor [BCP] and 158 T-cell ALL), with cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR) as the primary end point. In addition to conventional risk factors, the most frequent currently available genetic alterations were included in the analysis. A higher specific hazard of relapse was independently associated with postinduction MRD level ≥10(-4) and unfavorable genetic characteristics (ie, MLL gene rearrangement or focal IKZF1 gene deletion in BCP-ALL and no NOTCH1/FBXW7 mutation and/or N/K-RAS mutation and/or PTEN gene alteration in T-cell ALL). These 2 factors allowed definition of a new risk classification that is strongly associated with higher CIR and shorter relapse-free and overall survival. These results indicate that genetic abnormalities are important predictors of outcome in adult ALL not fully recapitulated by early response to therapy. Patients included in this study were treated in the multicenter GRAALL-2003 and GRAALL-2005 trials. Both trials were registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00222027 and #NCT00327678, respectively.",cancer
2279,"Point-of-Care Technologies for the Advancement of Precision Medicine in Heart, Lung, Blood, and Sleep Disorders.","The commercialization of new point of care technologies holds great potential in facilitating and advancing precision medicine in heart, lung, blood, and sleep (HLBS) disorders. The delivery of individually tailored health care to a patient depends on how well that patient's health condition can be interrogated and monitored. Point of care technologies may enable access to rapid and cost-effective interrogation of a patient's health condition in near real time. Currently, physiological data are largely limited to single-time-point collection at the hospital or clinic, whereas critical information on some conditions must be collected in the home, when symptoms occur, or at regular intervals over time. A variety of HLBS disorders are highly dependent on transient variables, such as patient activity level, environment, time of day, and so on. Consequently, the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute sponsored a request for applications to support the development and commercialization of novel point-of-care technologies through small businesses (RFA-HL-14-011 and RFA-HL-14-017). Three of the supported research projects are described to highlight particular point-of-care needs for HLBS disorders and the breadth of emerging technologies.

1194,LKB1/KRAS mutant lung cancers constitute a genetic subset of NSCLC with increased sensitivity to MAPK and mTOR signalling inhibition.,"LKB1/STK11 is a multitasking tumour suppressor kinase. Germline inactivating mutations of the gene are responsible for the Peutz-Jeghers hereditary cancer syndrome. It is also somatically inactivated in approximately 30% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, we report that LKB1/KRAS mutant NSCLC cell lines are sensitive to the MEK inhibitor CI-1040 shown by a dose-dependent reduction in proliferation rate, whereas LKB1 and KRAS mutations alone do not confer similar sensitivity. We show that this subset of NSCLC is also sensitised to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Importantly, the data suggest that LKB1/KRAS mutant NSCLCs are a genetically and functionally distinct subset and further suggest that this subset of lung cancers might afford an opportunity for exploitation of anti-MAPK/mTOR-targeted therapies.",cancer
214,Gene amplification CCNE1 is related to poor survival and potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.,"This study examined the clinical significance of CCNE1 (Cyclin E1) amplification and assessed whether CCNE1 is a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer. CCNE1 expression and amplification in ovarian cancer was assessed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridization and clinical data collected by retrospective chart review. CCNE1 gene knockdown using silencing RNA and a CCNE1 gene transfection system were used to asses CCNE1 function in tissue samples of ovarian cancer. Gene amplification was identified in 18 (20.4%) of 88 ovarian carcinomas. CCNE1 copy number significantly correlated with CCNE1 protein expression (r = 0.522, P < .0001). CCNE1 amplification significantly correlated with shorter disease-free survival and overall survival (P < .001). There were nonsignificant trends between high protein expression and poor disease-free survival (P = .2865) and overall survival (P = .1248). Multivariate analysis showed gene amplification was an independent prognostic factor for disease-free survival and overall survival after standard platinum-taxane chemotherapy (P = .0274, P = .0023). Profound growth inhibition and apoptosis were observed in silencing RNA-treated cancer cells with gene amplification compared with results in cancer cells with CCNE1 moderate expression without gene amplification or with low CCNE1 expression. CCNE1 overexpression stimulated proliferation in ovarian cancer cell lines ES2 and TOV-21G, which have lower endogenous CCNE1 expression. These findings indicate that CCNE1 overexpression is critical to growth and survival of ovarian cancer tumors with CCNE1 gene amplification. Furthermore, they suggest that CCNE1 silencing RNA-induced phenotypes depend on amplification status of ovarian cancers. Therefore, CCNE1-targeted therapy may benefit ovarian cancer patients with CCNE1 amplification.",cancer
2163,Phenotypic consequences of somatic mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Mutations in the Ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene are frequently found in human cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Loss of ATM function confers sensitivity to ionising radiation (IR) and topoisomerase inhibitors and may thus define a subset of cancer patients that could get increased benefit from these therapies. In this study, we evaluated the phenotypic consequences of ATM missense changes reported in seven NSCLC cell lines with regard to radiosensitivity and functionality of ATM signalling. Our data demonstrate that only 2/7 NSCLC cell lines (H1395 and H23) harbouring ATM missense mutations show a functional impairment of ATM signalling following IR-exposure. In these two cell lines, the missense mutations caused a significant reduction in ATM protein levels, impairment of ATM signalling and marked radiosensitivity. Of note, only cell lines with homozygous mutations in the ATM gene showed significant impairment of ATM function. Based on these observations, we developed an immunohistochemistry-based assay to identify patients with loss or reduction of ATM protein expression in a clinical setting. In a set of 137 NSCLC and 154 colorectal cancer specimens we identified tumoral loss of ATM protein expression in 9.5% and 3.9% of cases, respectively, demonstrating the potential utility of this method.",nonCancer
1946,Impact of Surgical Complications Following Resection of Locally Advanced Rectal Adenocarcinoma on Adjuvant Chemotherapy Delivery and Survival Outcomes.,"Surgical complications after resection for locally advanced rectal cancer may influence adjuvant treatment outcomes and survival. Few studies have examined this effect.|This study aimed to examine the impact of surgical complications on adjuvant therapy delivery and survival in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with long-course chemoradiation followed by surgery.|This is a retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected multicenter colorectal cancer database.|Data were collected from the Australian Comprehensive Cancer Outcomes and Research Database.|All patients who completed neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery for locally advanced rectal cancer between January 2003 and December 2014 were selected.|We examined the types and frequency of surgical complications and their impact on the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy and survival.|Data were available for 517 patients, of whom 147 (28%) had a surgical complication. Patients with a surgical complication were less likely to commence adjuvant chemotherapy (33% vs 66%; p = 0.0005) and more likely to have adjuvant treatment commencing more than 8 weeks from surgery (71.8% vs 21.2%; p = 0.004). Wound-related complications (p = 0.001), return to operating theater (p = 0.004), and readmission within 30 days (p = 0.02) had the most significant negative impact on the delivery of adjuvant chemotherapy. Surgical complications were significantly more likely in males (31.6% vs 20.8%, p = 0.003) and laparoscopic converted cases (47.8% vs 21.8%, p = 0.03). For the entire patient population, adjuvant chemotherapy compared with surveillance was not associated with an improved recurrence-free survival (HR, 1.06; p = 0.83) but was associated with an improved overall survival (HR, 0.53; p = 0.04).|This study was limited by its retrospective design.|Surgical complications in patients having surgery following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced rectal cancer were associated with significantly reduced uptake and delays to receiving adjuvant therapy. Surgical complications, however, were not associated with either significantly reduced recurrence-free or overall survival. Adjuvant chemotherapy delivery was associated with improved overall survival.",nonCancer
1439,Differential relationships of somatic and cognitive anxiety with measures of processing speed in older adults.,"Research suggests a reciprocal relationship between late-life anxiety and cognition, particularly attention and executive functions. Whereas evidence supports a conceptual distinction between cognitive and somatic dimensions of anxiety, their differential relationship with cognitive outcomes has not been examined, particularly on tests of attention/executive functions that rely on processing speed. Study goals were threefold: (a) to describe levels of overall, cognitive, and somatic anxiety in a sample of older adults without dementia, (b) to determine if overall anxiety is associated with performance on select measures of attention/executive functions that rely on processing speed, and (c) to determine if a differential relationship exists between cognitive and somatic anxiety and cognitive performance. Participants were 368 community-dwelling older adults. Results showed that elevated levels of somatic, but not cognitive anxiety were associated with poorer performance across measures. Findings suggest that the nature of anxiety symptoms may have important implications for cognitive performance in older adults.",nonCancer
316,EGFR expression as a predictor of survival for first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: analysis of data from the phase 3 FLEX study.,"Findings from the phase 3 First-Line ErbituX in lung cancer (FLEX) study showed that the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·871, 95% CI 0·762-0·996; p=0·044) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To define patients benefiting most from cetuximab, we studied the association of tumour EGFR expression level with clinical outcome in FLEX study patients. We used prospectively collected tumour EGFR expression data to generate an immunohistochemistry score for FLEX study patients on a continuous scale of 0-300. We used response data to select an outcome-based discriminatory threshold immunohistochemistry score for EGFR expression of 200. Treatment outcome was analysed in patients with low (immunohistochemistry score <200) and high (≥200) tumour EGFR expression. The primary endpoint in the FLEX study was overall survival. We analysed patients from the FLEX intention-to-treat (ITT) population. The FLEX study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00148798. Tumour EGFR immunohistochemistry data were available for 1121 of 1125 (99·6%) patients from the FLEX study ITT population. High EGFR expression was scored for 345 (31%) evaluable patients and low for 776 (69%) patients. For patients in the high EGFR expression group, overall survival was longer in the chemotherapy plus cetuximab group than in the chemotherapy alone group (median 12·0 months [95% CI 10·2-15·2] vs 9·6 months [7·6-10·6]; HR 0·73, 0·58-0·93; p=0·011), with no meaningful increase in side-effects. We recorded no corresponding survival benefit for patients in the low EGFR expression group (median 9·8 months [8·9-12·2] vs 10·3 months [9·2-11·5]; HR 0·99, 0·84-1·16; p=0·88). A treatment interaction test assessing the difference in the HRs for overall survival between the EGFR expression groups suggested a predictive value for EGFR expression (p=0·044). High EGFR expression is a tumour biomarker that can predict survival benefit from the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC. Assessment of EGFR expression could offer a personalised treatment approach in this setting. Merck KGaA.",cancer
736,Do MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P interact in breast cancer susceptibility? A large pooled series from the breast cancer association consortium.,"Association studies in large series of breast cancer patients can be used to identify single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) contributing to breast cancer susceptibility. Previous studies have suggested associations between variants in TP53 (R72P) and MDM2 (SNP309) and cancer risk. Data from molecular studies suggest a functional interaction between these genes. We therefore investigated the effect of TP53 R72P and MDM2 SNP309 on breast cancer risk and age at onset of breast cancer in a pooled series of 5,191 cases and 3,834 controls from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC). Breast cancer risk was not found to be associated with the combined variant alleles [odds ratio (OR), 1.00; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.81-1.23]. Estimated ORs were 1.01 (95% CI, 0.93-1.09) per MDM2 SNP309 allele and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.91-1.04) for TP53 R72P. Although we did find evidence for a 4-year earlier age at onset for carriers of both variant alleles in one of the breast cancer patient series of the BCAC (the German series), we were not able to confirm this effect in the pooled analysis. Even so, carriers of both variant alleles did not have different risk estimates for bilateral or estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. In conclusion, in this large collaborative study, we did not find an association of MDM2 SNP309 and TP53 R72P, separately or in interaction, with breast cancer. This suggests that any effect of these two variants would be very small and possibly confined to subgroups that were not assessed in our present study.",cancer
1317,[Effects of Vibrax (Mechanical Vibrations) on the Arterial Blood Gases of Patients in the Intensive Care Unit after Cardiac Surgery].,"Objective: Respiratory physiotherapy is an integral part of the care of patients in intensive care units (ICU) after cardiac surgery. One of the most commonly used techniques in ICU to prevent pulmonary complications are mechanical vibrations, which can be applied with a tool called Vibrax.The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Vibrax (mechanical vibrations) on the arterial blood gases of patients in ICU during the 1. or 2. day after cardiac surgery. Methods: A randomized controlled pilot study was conducted with 23 patients. The participants of the control group (CG) received a cardiovascular training with mobilization to the edge of the bed and active breathing exercises. On the patients of the intervention group (IG) additionally Vibrax was applied for 5 minutes. As primary outcome parameter the PaO2/FiO2 ratio was measured. Results: In the CG no significant changes over time were observed (p ≥ 0.06). The IG showed a significant (p = 0.009) increase in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio from before the physiotherapy intervention (M = 296.52, SE = 34.94 mmHg) to 60 minutes after completion of the physiotherapy intervention (M = 331.39, SE = 48.14 mmHg). There was no significant difference between the CG and IG at any measuring time (p ≥ 0.09). Conclusion: The results of this pilot study indicate that the application of Vibrax has positive effects on the arterial blood gases of patients in ICU on the 1. or 2. day after cardiac surgery. But whether the effects are clinically relevant could not be clarified.",nonCancer
91,TET2 gene mutation is unfavorable prognostic factor in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia patients with NPM1+ and FLT3-ITD - mutations.,"Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (cn-AML) is a group of heterogeneous diseases. Gene mutations are increasingly used to assess the prognosis of cn-AML patients and guide risk-adapted treatment. In the present study, we analyzed the molecular genetics characteristics of 373 adult cn-AML patients and explored the relationship between TET2 gene mutations or different genetic mutation patterns and prognosis. We found that 16.1 % of patients had TET2 mutations, 31.6 % had FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs), 6.2 % had FLT3 tyrosine kinase domain mutations, 2.4 % had c-KIT mutations, 37.8 % had NPM1 mutations, 11.3 % had WT1 mutations, 5.9 % had RUNX1 mutations, 11.5 % had ASXL1 mutations, 3.8 % had MLL-PTDs, 7.8 % had IDH1 mutations, 7.8 % had NRAS mutations, 12.3 % had IDH2 mutations, 1.6 % had EZH2 mutations, and 14.7 % had DNMT3A mutations, while none had CBL mutations. Gene mutations were detected in 76.94 % (287/373) of all patients. In the NPM1m(+) patients, those with TET2 mutations were associated with a shorter median overall survival (OS) as compared to TET2 wild-type (wt) patients (9.9 vs. 27.0 months, respectively; P = 0.023); Interestingly, the TET2 mutation was identified as an unfavorable prognostic factor and was closely associated with a shorter median OS as compared to TET2-wt (9.5 vs. 32.2 months, respectively; P = 0.013) in the NPM1m(+)/FLT3-ITDm(-) patient group. Thus, identification of TET2 combined with classic NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations allowed us to stratify cn-AML into distinct subtypes.",cancer
2102,Effect of Helicobacter pylori infection on chronic periodontitis by the change of microecology and inflammation.,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a pathogen inducing peptic disease, is recently found to be binding to the progress of periodontitis. Most previous studies are case-controlled, and they investigate the risk of H. pylori infection in disease the development of while few studies evaluate the correlation between H. pylori and periodontal pathogens. Therefore, we investigated the correlation between H. pylori infection with periodontal parameters, periodontal pathogens and inflammation. The results indicated that patients with H. pylori showed significantly higher probing depth and attachment loss than those without (p < 0.05). Among 28 subgingival plaque samples from 14 patients, the frequencies of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Treponema denticola were significantly higher with H. pylori infection than those without H. pylori infection (p < 0.05). However, the frequency of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans was lower (p < 0.05). Furthermore, after human acute monocytic leukemia cell line (THP-1) was stimulated with cagA-positive standard strains (cagA+ H. pylori 26695), the expression of periodontitis-related molecules Wnt5a, interleukin 8 (IL-8), interleukin 6 (IL-6) and interferon gamma (IFN-γ) significantly increased (p < 0.05). Conversely, the expression of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) was almost stable. Meanwhile, cagA+ H. pylori promoted significantly higher expression of IL-8 and Wnt5a than isogenic cagA mutants strains (cagA- H. pylori 26695) did. Taken together, our data suggested that H. pylori might promote the growth of some periodontal pathogens and aggravate the progress of chronic periodontitis.",nonCancer
1009,Recurrent involvement of 2p23 in inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors.,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a relatively rare soft tissue tumor. The reactive versus neoplastic pathogenesis of this tumor is unresolved. We found clonal chromosome aberrations involving 2p23 upon metaphase analysis of two IMTs. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with a probe flanking the ALK gene at 2p23 demonstrated rearrangement of the probe in both of these cases and in a third case, and immunohistochemistry revealed ALK expression in all three cases. 2p22-24 involvement has been reported previously in four additional cases of IMT. We suggest that chromosomal rearrangements involving 2p23 near or within ALK are recurrent alterations in IMT and that ALK may have a novel role outside its previously recognized realm of lymphoid neoplasms.",cancer
377,An activated ErbB3/NRG1 autocrine loop supports in vivo proliferation in ovarian cancer cells.,"Ovarian cancer is a leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancies. Treatment for advanced-stage disease remains limited and, to date, targeted therapies have been incompletely explored. By systematically suppressing each human tyrosine kinase in ovarian cancer cell lines by RNAi, we found that an autocrine signal-transducing loop involving NRG1 and activated ErbB3 operates in a subset of primary ovarian cancers and ovarian cancer cell lines. Perturbation of this circuit with ErbB3-directed RNAi decreased cell growth in three-dimensional culture and resulted in decreased disease progression and prolonged survival in a xenograft mouse model of ovarian cancer. Furthermore, a monoclonal ErbB3-directed antibody (MM-121) also significantly inhibited tumor growth in vivo. These findings identify ErbB3 as a potential therapeutic target in ovarian cancer.",cancer
2366,Prognostic value of parameters derived from white blood cell and differential counts in patients receiving palliative radiotherapy.,"The aim of the present study was to identify white blood cell (WBC) parameters with high prognostic value for the survival of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy. The prognostic value of seven parameters derived from WBC and differential counts was retrospectively evaluated in patients who underwent palliative radiotherapy between October, 2010 and June, 2013. The analyzed parameters were the total WBC count, the absolute and relative lymphocyte count, the absolute and relative neutrophil count, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios. Following univariate analysis, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed to adjust for gender, age, disease type, previous chemotherapy, previous radiotherapy and the levels of albumin and lactate dehydrogenase. A total of 220 patients with a median survival of 4.7 months were identified. All seven parameters were found to be statistically significant predictors of survival on univariate Cox regression analysis (P<0.05). Of these parameters, the low relative lymphocyte and high relative neutrophil counts were consistent predictors of poor survival in patients who received chemotherapy within 1 month prior to blood sampling (n=68) and in patients who received steroid treatment at the time of sampling (n=49). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that the relative lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were independent predictors of survival in all 220 patients (P<0.05). In conclusion, relative lymphocyte and neutrophil counts were of high prognostic value for the survival of patients receiving palliative radiotherapy, even in those receiving medications that affect WBC and differential counts.",nonCancer
2006,A two-step mechanism of cellular uptake of cationic gold nanoparticles modified by (16-mercaptohexadecyl)trimethylammonium bromide (MTAB).,"Cationic colloidal gold nanorods (GNRs) have a great potential as a theranostic tool for diverse medical applications. GNRs' properties such as cellular internalization and stability are determined by physico-chemical characteristics of their surface coating. GNRs modified by (16-mercaptohexadecyl)trimethylammonium bromide (MTAB), MTABGNRs, show excellent cellular uptake. Despite their promise for biomedicine, however, relatively little is known about the cellular pathways that facilitate the uptake of GNRs, their subcellular fate and intracellular persistence. Here we studied the mechanism of cellular internalization and long term fate of GNRs coated with MTAB, which synthesis was optimized to give higher yield, in various human cell types including normal diploid versus cancerous, and dividing versus non-dividing (senescent) cells. The process of MTABGNRs internalization into their final destination in lysosomes proceeds in two steps: 1) fast passive adhesion to cell membrane mediated by sulfated proteoglycans occurring within minutes and 2) slower active transmembrane and intracellular transport of individual nanorods via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and of aggregated nanorods via macropinocytosis. The expression of sulfated proteoglycans was the major factor determining the extent of uptake by the respective cell types. Upon uptake into proliferating cells, MTABGNRs were diluted equally and relatively rapidly into daughter cells, however, in non-dividing/senescent cells the loss of MTABGNRs was gradual and very modest, attributable mainly to exocytosis. Exocytosed MTABGNRs can be again internalized. These findings broaden our knowledge about cellular uptake of gold nanorods, a crucial prerequisite for future successful engineering of nanoparticles for biomedical applications such as photothermal cancer therapy or elimination of senescent cells as part of the emerging rejuvenation approaches.",nonCancer
1242,S768I Mutation in EGFR in Patients with Lung Cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutations are relatively common oncogenic drivers in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The outcomes of patients who present with less common EGFR mutations or more than one EGFR mutation are uncertain. We reviewed our experience with the S768I mutation of exon 20 of EGFR to provide insight into the clinical significance of this mutation. We used a natural language search program to search our electronic medical record system and every EGFR mutation analysis of patients with NSCLC treated at Mayo Clinic that was performed in our Department of Molecular Genetics to identify patients with EGFR S768I mutation. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were abstracted for selected cases, including evaluation of response after treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A total of 1527 patients with NSCLC who underwent EGFR testing were reviewed. The S768I mutation was present in nine patients (0.59%), four of whom were female. Only three had an isolated S768I mutation, four had a concurrent G719 mutation, and two had a concurrent L858R mutation. Among patients with stage IV disease treated with erlotinib (n = 4), one had an isolated S768I mutation and three had additional mutations (two patients with G719 and one patient with L858R). The tumor response to erlotinib of patients with stage IV disease was highly variable (progression-free survival ranged from 3 to 30 months and overall survival ranged from 5 to more than 51 months). S768I mutations in exon 20 of the EGFR gene are rare and are typically seen in conjunction with sensitizing EGFR mutations. Because of this mutation's rarity and the variability of responses of treated cases, its exact prognostic and predictive role is not fully understood. In our experience, S768I mutations in isolation do not necessarily confer sensitivity to erlotinib, but in conjunction with sensitizing EGFR mutations, S768I mutations do not restrict efficacy.",cancer

In the BAL yeasts and a high proportion of immune senescence cells (CD57+) were identified. After a pulmonary wedge resection resulted histologically an epithelioid cell-granulomatous inflammation. Molecular pathological a mycelium genome, in particular Pichia guilliermondii (PC) was detected. The therapy with fluconazole was successful. PC rarely causes candidemia, increased in immunocompromised patients. In our judgement this is in Europe the first described case of PC-infection in a patient, which presented no predisposition to infection with opportunistic pathogens apart from type 2 diabetes.

We have performed a series of measurements of incident shock wave velocities and overpressures followed by quantification of impulse values (integral of pressure in time domain) for four different end plate configurations (0.625, 2, 4 inches, and an open end). Shock wave characteristics were monitored by high response rate pressure sensors allocated in six positions along the length of 6 meters long 229 mm square cross section shock tube. Tests were performed at three shock wave intensities, which was controlled by varying the Mylar membrane thickness (0.02, 0.04 and 0.06 inch). The end reflector plate installed at the exit of the shock tube allows precise control over the intensity of reflected waves penetrating into the shock tube. At the optimized distance of the tube to end plate gap the secondary waves were entirely eliminated from the test section, which was confirmed by pressure sensor at T4 location. This is pronounced finding for implementation of pure primary blast wave animal model. These data also suggest only deep in the shock tube experimental conditions allow exposure to a single shock wave free of artifacts. Our results provide detailed insight into spatiotemporal dynamics of shock waves with Friedlander waveform generated using helium as a driver gas and propagating in the air inside medium sized tube. Diffusion of driver gas (helium) inside the shock tube was responsible for velocity increase of reflected shock waves. Numerical simulations combined with experimental data suggest the shock wave attenuation mechanism is simply the expansion of the internal pressure. In the absence of any other postulated shock wave decay mechanisms, which were not implemented in the model the agreement between theory and experimental data is excellent.",nonCancer
364,Breast tumor cells with PI3K mutation or HER2 amplification are selectively addicted to Akt signaling.,"Dysregulated PI3K/Akt signaling occurs commonly in breast cancers and is due to HER2 amplification, PI3K mutation or PTEN inactivation. The objective of this study was to determine the role of Akt activation in breast cancer as a function of mechanism of activation and whether inhibition of Akt signaling is a feasible approach to therapy. A selective allosteric inhibitor of Akt kinase was used to interrogate a panel of breast cancer cell lines characterized for genetic lesions that activate PI3K/Akt signaling: HER2 amplification or PI3K or PTEN mutations in order to determine the biochemical and biologic consequences of inhibition of this pathway. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture and in vivo xenograft models revealed that tumors with mutational activation of Akt signaling were selectively dependent on the pathway. In sensitive cells, pathway inhibition resulted in D-cyclin loss, G1 arrest and induction of apoptosis, whereas cells without pathway activation were unaffected. Most importantly, the drug effectively inhibited Akt kinase and its downstream effectors in vivo and caused complete suppression of the growth of breast cancer xenografts with PI3K mutation or HER2 amplification, including models of the latter selected for resistance to Herceptin. Furthermore, chronic administration of the drug was well-tolerated, causing only transient hyperglycemia without gross toxicity to the host despite the pleiotropic normal functions of Akt. These data demonstrate that breast cancers with PI3K mutation or HER2 amplification are selectively dependent on Akt signaling, and that effective inhibition of Akt in tumors is feasible and effective in vivo. These findings suggest that direct inhibition of Akt may represent a therapeutic strategy for breast and other cancers that are addicted to the pathway including tumors with resistant to Herceptin.",cancer

1020,Genotype-phenotype correlations in von Hippel-Lindau disease.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome resulting from mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. VHL disease displays marked variation in expression and the presence of pheochromocytoma has been linked to missense VHL mutations. We analyzed genotype-phenotype correlations in 573 individuals with VHL disease. Routine clinical and radiological surveillance of VHL patients and at-risk relatives was associated with increased detection of retinal angiomatosis (73 vs. 59% of cases) and a reduction in age at diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) (44.0+/-10.9 vs. 39.7+/-10.3 years). We confirmed the association of pheochromocytoma with missense mutations described previously, but stratifying missense mutations into those that resulted in substitution of a surface amino acid and those that disrupted structural integrity demonstrated that surface amino acid substitutions conferred a higher pheochromocytoma risk. Age at first manifestation of VHL disease was significantly earlier (P=0.001), and age-related risks of retinal angiomas and RCC were higher (P=0.022 and P=0.0008, respectively) in individuals with a nonsense or frameshift mutation than in those with deletions or missense mutations that disrupted the structural integrity of the VHL gene product (pVHL). These results extend genotype-phenotype-protein structure correlations in VHL disease and provide a baseline for future chemoprevention studies in VHL disease.",cancer

CH5424802 inhibited ALK L1196M, which corresponds to the gatekeeper mutation conferring common resistance to kinase inhibitors, and blocked EML4-ALK L1196M-driven cell growth.

529,Low thrombospondin 2 expression is predictive of low tumor regression after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in rectal cancer.,"Neoadjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) followed by surgery is the mainstay of treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer. Several heparin-binding associated proteins have been reported to play a critical role in cancer progression. However, the clinical relevancies of such proteins and their associations with CCRT response in rectal cancer have not yet to be fully elucidated. The analysis of a public transcriptome of rectal cancer indicated that thrombospondin 2 (THBS2) is a predictive factor for CCRT response. Immunohistochemical analyses were conducted to evaluate the expression of THBS2 in pretreatment biopsy specimens from rectal cancer patients without distant metastasis. Furthermore, the relationships between THBS2 expression and various clinicopathological factors or survival were analyzed. Low expression of THBS2 was significantly associated with advanced pretreatment tumor (P<0.001) and nodal status (P=0.004), post-treatment tumor (P<0.001) and nodal status (P<0.001), increased vascular invasion (P=0.003), increased perineural invasion (P=0.023) and inferior tumor regression grade (P=0.015). In univariate analysis, low THBS2 expression predicted worse outcomes for disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival (all P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, low expression of THBS2 still served as a negative prognostic factor for disease-free survival (Hazard ratio=3.057, P=0.002) and metastasis-free survival (Hazard ratio=3.362, P=0.012). Low THBS2 expression was correlated with advanced disease status and low tumor regression after preoperative CCRT and that it acted as an independent negative prognostic factor in rectal cancer. THBS2 may represent a predictive biomarker for CCRT response in rectal cancer.",cancer

From this perspective, the usage of TLRs to modulate the immune system toward lymphoma regression is desirable. Various strategies have been used so far, and novel ways are being sought out to cure lymphoma.|TLR ligands have successfully been used to improve patient health; however, these receptors must be finely tuned to further optimize therapy.

We aimed to improve risk stratification of patients receiving first-line immunochemotherapy by integrating gene mutations into a prognostic model. We did DNA deep sequencing to retrospectively analyse the mutation status of 74 genes in 151 follicular lymphoma biopsy specimens that were obtained from patients within 1 year before beginning immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP). These patients were recruited between May 4, 2000, and Oct 20, 2010, as part of a phase 3 trial (GLSG2000). Eligible patients had symptomatic, advanced stage follicular lymphoma and were previously untreated. The primary endpoints were failure-free survival (defined as less than a partial remission at the end of induction, relapse, progression, or death) and overall survival calculated from date of treatment initiation. Median follow-up was 7·7 years (IQR 5·5-9·3). Mutations and clinical factors were incorporated into a risk model for failure-free survival using multivariable L1-penalised Cox regression. We validated the risk model in an independent population-based cohort of 107 patients with symptomatic follicular lymphoma considered ineligible for curative irradiation. Pretreatment biopsies were taken between Feb 24, 2004, and Nov 24, 2009, within 1 year before beginning first-line immunochemotherapy consisting of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CVP). Median follow-up was 6·7 years (IQR 5·7-7·6). We established a clinicogenetic risk model (termed m7-FLIPI) that included the mutation status of seven genes (EZH2, ARID1A, MEF2B, EP300, FOXO1, CREBBP, and CARD11), the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status. In the training cohort, m7-FLIPI defined a high-risk group (28%, 43/151) with 5-year failure-free survival of 38·29% (95% CI 25·31-57·95) versus 77·21% (95% CI 69·21-86·14) for the low-risk group (hazard ratio [HR] 4·14, 95% CI 2·47-6·93; p<0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 2·02), and outperformed a prognostic model of only gene mutations (HR 3·76, 95% CI 2·10-6·74; p<0·0001; bootstrap-corrected HR 1·57). The positive predictive value and negative predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival were 64% and 78%, respectively, with a C-index of 0·80 (95% CI 0·71-0·89). In the validation cohort, m7-FLIPI again defined a high-risk group (22%, 24/107) with 5-year failure-free survival of 25·00% (95% CI 12·50-49·99) versus 68·24% (58·84-79·15) in the low-risk group (HR 3·58, 95% CI 2·00-6·42; p<0.0001). The positive predictive value for 5-year failure-free survival was 72% and 68% for negative predictive value, with a C-index of 0·79 (95% CI 0·69-0·89). In the validation cohort, risk stratification by m7-FLIPI outperformed FLIPI alone (HR 2·18, 95% CI 1·21-3·92), and FLIPI combined with ECOG performance status (HR 2·03, 95% CI 1·12-3·67). Integration of the mutational status of seven genes with clinical risk factors improves prognostication for patients with follicular lymphoma receiving first-line immunochemotherapy and is a promising approach to identify the subset at highest risk of treatment failure.

946,TBCRC009: A Multicenter Phase II Clinical Trial of Platinum Monotherapy With Biomarker Assessment in Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.,"The identification of patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (mTNBC) who are expected to benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy is of interest. We conducted a single-arm phase II clinical trial of single-agent platinum for mTNBC with biomarker correlates. Patients with mTNBC received first- or second-line cisplatin (75 mg/m(2)) or carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve 6) by physician's choice once every 3 weeks. Coprimary end points were objective response rate (RR) and response prediction by p63/p73 gene expression. Secondary and exploratory end points included toxicity assessment, RR in cisplatin versus carboplatin, and RR in molecularly defined subgroups, including BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. Patients (N = 86; 69 as first-line therapy) received cisplatin (n = 43) or carboplatin (n = 43). RR was 25.6% (95% CI, 16.8% to 36%) and was numerically higher with cisplatin (32.6%) than with carboplatin (18.7%). RR was 54.5% in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 11). In patients without BRCA1/2 mutations (n = 66), exploratory analyses showed that a BRCA-like genomic instability signature (n = 32) discriminated responding and nonresponding tumors (mean homologous recombination deficiency-loss of heterozygosity/homologous recombination deficiency-large-scale state transitions [HRD-LOH/HRD-LST] scores were 12.68 and 5.11, respectively), whereas predefined analysis by p63/p73 expression status (n = 61), p53 and PIK3CA mutation status (n = 53), or PAM50 gene expression subtype (n = 55) did not. Five of the six long-term responders alive at a median of 4.5 years lacked germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and two of them had increased tumor HRD-LOH/HRD-LST scores. Platinum agents are active in mTNBC, especially in patients with germline BRCA1/2 mutations. A measure of tumor DNA repair function may identify patients without mutations who could benefit from platinum therapy agents. Prospective controlled confirmatory trials are warranted.",cancer
795,DPC4 gene status of the primary carcinoma correlates with patterns of failure in patients with pancreatic cancer.,"Contrary to the extensive data accumulated regarding pancreatic carcinogenesis, the clinical and molecular features characteristic of advanced stage (stage III and IV) disease are unknown. A comprehensive study of pancreatic cancers from patients who have succumbed to their disease has the potential to greatly expand our understanding of the most lethal stage of this disease and identify novel areas for intervention. Rapid autopsies were performed on 76 patients with documented pancreatic cancer. The histologic features of end stage disease were determined and correlated to the stage at initial diagnosis, patterns of failure (locally destructive v metastatic disease) and the status of the KRAS2, TP53, and DPC4 genes. At autopsy, 30% of patients died with locally destructive pancreatic cancer, and 70% died with widespread metastatic disease. These divergent patterns of failure found at autopsy (locally destructive v metastatic) were unrelated to clinical stage at initial presentation, treatment history, or histopathologic features. However, Dpc4 immunolabeling status of carcinoma tissues harvested at autopsy, a sensitive marker of DPC4 genetic status, was highly correlated with the presence of widespread metastasis but not with locally destructive tumors (P = .007). Pancreatic cancers are represented by distinct genetic subtypes with significantly different patterns of failure. Determinations of DPC4 status at initial diagnosis may be of value in stratifying patients into treatment regimens related to local control versus systemic therapy.",cancer
2314,An energetics-based honeybee nectar-foraging model used to assess the potential for landscape-level pesticide exposure dilution.,"Estimating the exposure of honeybees to pesticides on a landscape scale requires models of their spatial foraging behaviour. For this purpose, we developed a mechanistic, energetics-based model for a single day of nectar foraging in complex landscape mosaics. Net energetic efficiency determined resource patch choice. In one version of the model a single optimal patch was selected each hour. In another version, recruitment of foragers was simulated and several patches could be exploited simultaneously. Resource availability changed during the day due to depletion and/or intrinsic properties of the resource (anthesis). The model accounted for the impact of patch distance and size, resource depletion and replenishment, competition with other nectar foragers, and seasonal and diurnal patterns in availability of nectar-providing crops and wild flowers. From the model we derived simple rules for resource patch selection, e.g., for landscapes with mass-flowering crops only, net energetic efficiency would be proportional to the ratio of the energetic content of the nectar divided by distance to the hive. We also determined maximum distances at which resources like oilseed rape and clover were still energetically attractive. We used the model to assess the potential for pesticide exposure dilution in landscapes of different composition and complexity. Dilution means a lower concentration in nectar arriving at the hive compared to the concentration in nectar at a treated field and can result from foraging effort being diverted away from treated fields. Applying the model for all possible hive locations over a large area, distributions of dilution factors were obtained that were characterised by their 90-percentile value. For an area for which detailed spatial data on crops and off-field semi-natural habitats were available, we tested three landscape management scenarios that were expected to lead to exposure dilution: providing alternative resources than the target crop (oilseed rape) in the form of (i) other untreated crop fields, (ii) flower strips of different widths at field edges (off-crop in-field resources), and (iii) resources on off-field (semi-natural) habitats. For both model versions, significant dilution occurred only when alternative resource patches were equal or more attractive than oilseed rape, nearby and numerous and only in case of flower strips and off-field habitats. On an area-base, flower strips were more than one order of magnitude more effective than off-field habitats, the main reason being that flower strips had an optimal location. The two model versions differed in the predicted number of resource patches exploited over the day, but mainly in landscapes with numerous small resource patches. In landscapes consisting of few large resource patches (crop fields) both versions predicted the use of a small number of patches.",nonCancer
584,Trastuzumab emtansine is active on HER-2 overexpressing NSCLC cell lines and overcomes gefitinib resistance.,"HER-2 represents a relatively new therapeutic target for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. The incidence for reported HER-2 overexpression/amplification/mutations ranges from 2 to 20% in NSCLC. Moreover, HER-2 amplification is a potential mechanism of resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKI) (about 10% of cases). T-DM1, trastuzumab emtansine is an antibody-drug conjugate composed by the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the microtubule polymerization inhibitor DM1. The activity of T-DM1 has been studied in breast cancer but the role of T-DM1 in lung cancer remains unexplored. Antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects of T-DM1 have been investigated in different NSCLC cell lines by MTT, crystal violet staining, morphological study and Western blotting. HER-2 expression and cell cycle were evaluated by flow cytometry and Western blotting. Antibody dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) was measured with a CytoTox assay. Xenografted mice model has been generated using a NSCLC cell line to evaluate the effect of T-DM1 on tumor growth. Moreover, a morphometric and immunohistochemical analysis of tumor xenografts was conducted. In this study we investigated the effect of T-DM1 in a panel of NSCLC cell lines with different HER-2 expression levels, in H1781 cell line carrying HER-2 mutation and in gefitinib resistant HER-2 overexpressing PC9/HER2cl1 cell clone. T-DM1 efficiently inhibited proliferation with arrest in G2-M phase and induced cell death by apoptosis in cells with a significant level of surface expression of HER-2. Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity assay documented that T-DM1 maintained the same activity of trastuzumab. Our data also suggest that targeting HER-2 with T-DM1 potentially overcomes gefitinib resistance. In addition a correlation between cell density/tumor size with both HER-2 expression and T-DM1 activity was established in vitro and in an in vivo xenograft model. Our results indicate that targeting HER-2 with T-DM1 may offer a new therapeutic approach in HER-2 over-expressing lung cancers including those resistant to EGFR TKIs.",cancer
26,Activating mutations in ALK provide a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastoma, an embryonal tumour of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, accounts for approximately 15% of all deaths due to childhood cancer. High-risk neuroblastomas are rapidly progressive; even with intensive myeloablative chemotherapy, relapse is common and almost uniformly fatal. Here we report the detection of previously unknown mutations in the ALK gene, which encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, in 8% of primary neuroblastomas. Five non-synonymous sequence variations were identified in the kinase domain of ALK, of which three were somatic and two were germ line. The most frequent mutation, F1174L, was also identified in three different neuroblastoma cell lines. ALK complementary DNAs encoding the F1174L and R1275Q variants, but not the wild-type ALK cDNA, transformed interleukin-3-dependent murine haematopoietic Ba/F3 cells to cytokine-independent growth. Ba/F3 cells expressing these mutations were sensitive to the small-molecule inhibitor of ALK, TAE684 (ref. 4). Furthermore, two human neuroblastoma cell lines harbouring the F1174L mutation were also sensitive to the inhibitor. Cytotoxicity was associated with increased amounts of apoptosis as measured by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL). Short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of ALK expression in neuroblastoma cell lines with the F1174L mutation also resulted in apoptosis and impaired cell proliferation. Thus, activating alleles of the ALK receptor tyrosine kinase are present in primary neuroblastoma tumours and in established neuroblastoma cell lines, and confer sensitivity to ALK inhibition with small molecules, providing a molecular rationale for targeted therapy of this disease.",cancer
2412,Farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 inhibits breast cell invasion and migration by blocking H-Ras activation.,"Hyperactive Ras promotes proliferation and malignant phenotypic conversion of cells in cancer. Ras protein must be associated with cellular membranes for its oncogenic activities through post-translational modifications, including farnesylation. Farnesyltransferase (FTase) is essential for H-Ras membrane targeting, and H-Ras, but not N-Ras, has been demonstrated to cause an invasive phenotype in MCF10A breast epithelial cells. In the present study, it was observed that an FTase inhibitor (FTI), FTI-277, blocked epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced H-Ras activation, but not N-Ras activation in MDA-MB-231 cells, which express wild-type H-Ras and N-Ras. FTI-277 exerted a more potent inhibitory effect on the proliferation of H-Ras-MCF10A cells and Hs578T breast cancer cells expressing an active mutant of H-Ras than that of MDA-MB-231 cells. The invasive/migratory phenotypes of the H-Ras-MCF10A and Hs578T cells were effectively inhibited by FTI-277 treatment. By contrast, FTI-277 did not affect the invasive/migratory phenotypes of MDA-MB-231 cells. However, the EGF-induced invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells was decreased by FTI-277, implicating that FTI-277 inhibits breast cell invasion and migration by blocking H-Ras activation. Taken together, the results of the present study suggest that FTase inhibition by FTI-277 may be an effective strategy for targeting H-Ras-mediated proliferation, migration and invasion of breast cells.",nonCancer
1038,What hides behind the MASC: clinical response and acquired resistance to entrectinib after ETV6-NTRK3 identification in a mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC).,"Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (MASC) is a recently described pathologic entity. We report the case of a patient with an initial diagnosis of salivary acinic cell carcinoma later reclassified as MASC after next-generation sequencing revealed an ETV6-NTRK3 fusion. This alteration was targeted with the pan-Trk inhibitor entrectinib (Ignyta), which possesses potent in vitro activity against cell lines containing various NTRK1/2/3 fusions. A dramatic and durable response was achieved with entrectinib in this patient, followed by acquired resistance that correlated with the appearance of a novel NTRK3 G623R mutation. Structural modeling predicts that this alteration sterically interferes with drug binding, correlating to decreased sensitivity to drug inhibition observed in cell-based assays. This first report of clinical activity with TrkC inhibition and the development of acquired resistance in an NTRK3-rearranged cancer emphasize the utility of comprehensive molecular profiling and targeted therapy for rare malignancies (NCT02097810).",cancer
1881,Combined Epidural-General Anesthesia vs General Anesthesia Alone for Elective Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Repair.,"Epidural analgesia (EA) is used as an adjunct procedure for postoperative pain control during elective abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) surgery. In addition to analgesia, modulatory effects of EA on spinal sympathetic outflow result in improved organ perfusion with reduced complications. Reductions in postoperative complications lead to shorter convalescence and possibly improved 30-day survival. However, the effect of EA on long-term survival when used as an adjunct to general anesthesia (GA) during elective AAA surgery is unknown.|To evaluate the association between combined EA-GA vs GA alone and long-term survival and postoperative complications in patients undergoing elective, open AAA repair.|A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data was performed. Patients undergoing elective AAA repair between January 1, 2003, and December 31, 2011, were identified within the Vascular Society Group of New England (VSGNE) database. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival. Cox proportional hazards regression models and multivariable logistic regression models assessed the independent association of EA-GA use with postoperative mortality and morbidity, respectively. Data analysis was conducted from March 15, 2015, to September 2, 2015.|Combined EA-GA.|The primary outcome measure was all-cause mortality. Secondary end points included postoperative bowel ischemia, respiratory complications, myocardial infarction, dialysis requirement, wound complications, and need for surgical reintervention within 30 days of surgery.|A total of 1540 patients underwent elective AAA repair during the study period. Of these, 410 patients (26.6%) were women and the median (interquartile range) age was 71 (64-76) years; 980 individuals (63.6%) received EA-GA. Patients in the 2 groups were comparable in terms of age, comorbidities, and suprarenal clamp location. At 5 years, the Kaplan-Meier-estimated overall survival rates were 74% (95% CI, 72%-76%) and 65% (95% CI, 62%-68%) in the EA-GA and GA-alone groups, respectively (P < .01). In adjusted analyses, EA-GA use was associated with significantly lower hazards of mortality compared with GA alone (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57-0.92; P = .01). Patients receiving EA-GA also had lower odds of 30-day surgical reintervention (odds ratio [OR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44-0.94; P = .02) as well as postoperative bowel ischemia (OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31-0.94; P = .03), pulmonary complications (OR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.41-0.95; P = .03), and dialysis requirements (OR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.23-0.88; P = .02). No significant differences were noted for the odds of wound (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.38-1.44; P = .51) and cardiac (OR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.59-1.78; P = .82) complications.|Combined EA-GA was associated with improved survival and significantly lower HRs and ORs for mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing elective AAA repair. The survival benefit may be attributable to reduced immediate postoperative adverse events. Based on these findings, EA-GA should be strongly considered in suitable patients.",nonCancer

Plasma and saliva from patients with fibroadenoma (n=10), infiltrating ductal carcinoma (n=10) and healthy control groups (n=8) were assessed by combinations of inter/intra-group analyses, revealing significant quantitative and qualitative differences. The major differentially-expressed proteins in the saliva of patients compared with the controls were α2-macroglobulin and ceruloplasmin, but the proteins that met the minimum fold-change and P-value cut-offs were leukocyte elastase inhibitor and α-enolase, and deleted in malignant brain tumors 1. Concerning plasma, α-2-macroglobulin and ceruplasmin were upregulated, while other proteins such as haptoglobin, hemopexin and vitamin D-binding protein were downregulated compared with the control. The changes in immune, molecular transport and signaling pathways were the most representative in the proteomic profile of the saliva and plasma. This is the first study to describe the proteome of saliva and plasma from the same women with impalpable breast lesions.",nonCancer
1338,Promoter effect of hydration on the nucleation of nanoparticles: direct observation for gold and copper on rutile TiO2 (110).,"Direct observation of the promoting effect of hydration on the nucleation of gold and copper nanoparticles supported on partially reduced rutile TiO2 (110) is achieved by combined scanning tunneling microscopy experiments and density functional theory calculations. The experiments show a clear difference between the two metals. Gold nanoparticles grow at the vicinity of the surface hydroxyl domains, whereas the nucleation of copper is not substantially affected by hydration. The nucleation of gold on surface oxygen vacancies is observed although this is not the only preferential site. Theoretical calculations of the coadsorbed phases of gold, copper and hydroxyl species on stoichiometric and reduced TiO2 (110) surfaces under relevant conditions of temperature and pressure support the experimental interpretation. Surface hydration tends to stabilize significantly gold adsorption on the stoichiometric support, while its influence on copper adsorption is not pronounced. The theoretical analysis shows that the early stages of the nucleation on hydrated stoichiometric surfaces correspond to mono-hydroxylated metallic species co-chemisorbed with hydroxyl species, whereas those on hydrated reduced surfaces are metallic atoms bound to oxygen vacancies and weakly perturbed by surface hydration.",nonCancer
1992,Ultra-Low-Power Electronic Trapping of Nanoparticles with Sub-10 nm Gold Nanogap Electrodes.,"We demonstrate ultra-low-power electronic nanogap electrodes for rapid and parallel on-chip trapping and releasing of nanoparticles. Our device pushes the limit of dielectrophoresis by shrinking the separation between gold electrodes to sub-10 nm, thereby creating strong trapping forces at biases as low as 100 mV ranges. Using high-throughput atomic layer lithography, we manufacture sub-10 nm gaps between millimeter-long gold electrodes and pattern them into individually addressable parallel electronic traps. Unlike point-like junctions made by electron-beam lithography or larger micron-gap electrodes that are used for conventional dielectrophoresis, our sub-10 nm gold nanogap electrodes provide strong trapping forces over a millimeter-long trapping zone. Importantly, our technology solves the key challenges associated with traditional dielectrophoresis experiments such as high voltages that cause heat/bubble generation and unwanted electrochemical reactions. The strongly enhanced fields around the nanogap induce particle transport speed exceeding 10 µm/s and enable trapping of 30 nm polystyrene nanoparticles using an ultra-low bias of 200 mV. We also demonstrate rapid electronic trapping of quantum dots and nanodiamond particles on arrays of parallel traps. Our sub-10 nm gold nanogap electrodes can be combined with plasmonic sensors or nanophotonic circuitry, and their low-power electronic operation can potentially enable high-density integration on a chip.",nonCancer
1602,Mapping the local particle plasmon sensitivity with a scanning probe.,"We probe the local sensitivity of an optically excited plasmonic nanoparticle by changing the local dielectric environment through a scanning glass fiber tip. Recording the particle plasmon scattering spectrum for each tip position allows us to observe spectral resonance shifts concurrent with changes in scattering intensity and plasmon damping. For the tip-induced spectral shifts we find the strongest sensitivity at the particle edges, in accordance with the spatial plasmonic field profile. In contrast, the strongest sensitivity occurs at the center of the particle if the scattering intensity is probed at the short wavelength slope of the plasmon resonance instead of the resonance position. This bears important implications for plasmonic sensing, in particular when done at a single light wavelength.",nonCancer

2055,Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Amyloid β-Peptide (1-42): Tetramer Formation and Membrane Interactions.,"The aggregation cascade and peptide-membrane interactions of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) have been implicated as toxic events in the development and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Aβ42 forms oligomers and ultimately plaques, and it has been hypothesized that these oligomeric species are the main toxic species contributing to neuronal cell death. To better understand oligomerization events and subsequent oligomer-membrane interactions of Aβ42, we performed atomistic molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations to characterize both interpeptide interactions and perturbation of model membranes by the peptides. MD simulations were utilized to first show the formation of a tetramer unit by four separate Aβ42 peptides. Aβ42 tetramers adopted an oblate ellipsoid shape and showed a significant increase in β-strand formation in the final tetramer unit relative to the monomers, indicative of on-pathway events for fibril formation. The Aβ42 tetramer unit that formed in the initial simulations was used in subsequent MD simulations in the presence of a pure POPC or cholesterol-rich raft model membrane. Tetramer-membrane simulations resulted in elongation of the tetramer in the presence of both model membranes, with tetramer-raft interactions giving rise to the rearrangement of key hydrophobic regions in the tetramer and the formation of a more rod-like structure indicative of a fibril-seeding aggregate. Membrane perturbation by the tetramer was manifested in the form of more ordered, rigid membranes, with the pure POPC being affected to a greater extent than the raft membrane. These results provide critical atomistic insight into the aggregation pathway of Aβ42 and a putative toxic mechanism in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.",nonCancer
69,Identification of targetable FGFR gene fusions in diverse cancers.,"Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, four index cases were identified which harbor gene rearrangements of FGFR2, including patients with cholangiocarcinoma, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. After extending our assessment of FGFR rearrangements across multiple tumor cohorts, we identified additional FGFR fusions with intact kinase domains in lung squamous cell cancer, bladder cancer, thyroid cancer, oral cancer, glioblastoma, and head and neck squamous cell cancer. All FGFR fusion partners tested exhibit oligomerization capability, suggesting a shared mode of kinase activation. Overexpression of FGFR fusion proteins induced cell proliferation. Two bladder cancer cell lines that harbor FGFR3 fusion proteins exhibited enhanced susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition in vitro and in vivo. Because of the combinatorial possibilities of FGFR family fusion to a variety of oligomerization partners, clinical sequencing efforts, which incorporate transcriptome analysis for gene fusions, are poised to identify rare, targetable FGFR fusions across diverse cancer types.",cancer
1039,In vitro analyses of known and novel RUNX1/AML1 mutations in dominant familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia: implications for mechanisms of pathogenesis.,"Familial platelet disorder with predisposition to acute myelogenous leukemia (FPD/AML) is an autosomal dominant familial platelet disorder characterized by thrombocytopenia and a propensity to develop AML. Mutation analyses of RUNX1 in 3 families with FPD/AML showing linkage to chromosome 21q22.1 revealed 3 novel heterozygous point mutations (K83E, R135fsX177 (IVS4 + 3delA), and Y260X). Functional investigations of the 7 FPD/AML RUNX1 Runt domain point mutations described to date (2 frameshift, 2 nonsense, and 3 missense mutations) were performed. Consistent with the position of the mutations in the Runt domain at the RUNX1-DNA interface, DNA binding of all mutant RUNX1 proteins was absent or significantly decreased. In general, missense and nonsense RUNX1 proteins retained the ability to heterodimerize with PEBP2beta/CBFbeta and inhibited transactivation of a reporter gene by wild-type RUNX1. Colocalization of mutant RUNX1 and PEBP2beta/CBFbeta in the cytoplasm was observed. These results suggest that the sequestration of PEBP2beta/CBFbeta by mutant RUNX1 may cause the inhibitory effects. While haploinsufficiency of RUNX1 causes FPD/AML in some families (deletions and frameshifts), mutant RUNX1 proteins (missense and nonsense) may also inhibit wild-type RUNX1, possibly creating a higher propensity to develop leukemia. This is consistent with the hypothesis that a second mutation has to occur, either in RUNX1 or another gene, to cause leukemia among individuals harboring RUNX1 FPD/AML mutations and that the propensity to acquire these additional mutations is determined, at least partially, by the initial RUNX1 mutation.",cancer
1671,Electrolyte and mineral disturbances in septic acute kidney injury patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy.,"Electrolyte and mineral disturbances remain a major concern in patients undergoing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT); however, it is not clear whether those imbalances are associated with adverse outcomes in patients with septic acute kidney injury (AKI) undergoing CRRT. We conducted a post-hoc analysis of data from a prospective randomized controlled trial. A total of 210 patients with a mean age of 62.2 years (136 [64.8%] males) in 2 hospitals were enrolled. Levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, and phosphate measured before (0 hour) and 24 hours after CRRT initiation. Before starting CRRT, at least 1 deficiency and excess in electrolytes or minerals were observed in 126 (60.0%) and 188 (67.6%) patients, respectively. The excess in these parameters was greatly improved, whereas hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia became more prevalent at 24 hours after CRRT. However, 1 and 2 or more deficiencies in those parameters at the 2 time points were not associated with mortality. However, during 28 days, 89 (71.2%) deaths occurred in patients with phosphate levels at 0 hour of ≥4.5 mg/dL as compared with 49 (57.6%) in patients with phosphate levels <4.5 mg/dL. The 90-day mortality was also significantly higher in patients with hyperphosphatemia. Similarly, in 184 patients who survived at 24 hours after CRRT, hyperphosphatemia conferred a 2.2-fold and 2.6-fold increased risk of 28- and 90-day mortality, respectively. The results remained unaltered when the serum phosphate level was analyzed as a continuous variable. Electrolyte and mineral disturbances are common, and hyperphosphatemia may predict poor prognosis in septic AKI patients undergoing CRRT.",nonCancer

We aimed to compare trastuzumab emtansine, an antibody-drug conjugate comprising the cytotoxic agent DM1 linked to trastuzumab, with treatment of physician's choice in this population of patients. This randomised, open-label, phase 3 trial took place in medical centres in 22 countries across Europe, North America, South America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients (≥18 years, left ventricular ejection fraction ≥50%, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2) with progressive HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who had received two or more HER2-directed regimens in the advanced setting, including trastuzumab and lapatinib, and previous taxane therapy in any setting, were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to trastuzumab emtansine (3·6 mg/kg intravenously every 21 days) or physician's choice using a permuted block randomisation scheme by an interactive voice and web response system. Patients were stratified according to world region (USA vs western Europe vs other), number of previous regimens (excluding single-agent hormonal therapy) for the treatment of advanced disease (two to three vs more than three), and presence of visceral disease (any vs none). Coprimary endpoints were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival in the intention-to-treat population. We report the final PFS analysis and the first interim overall survival analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01419197. From Sept 14, 2011, to Nov 19, 2012, 602 patients were randomly assigned (404 to trastuzumab emtansine and 198 to physician's choice). At data cutoff (Feb 11, 2013), 44 patients assigned to physician's choice had crossed over to trastuzumab emtansine. After a median follow-up of 7·2 months (IQR 5·0-10·1 months) in the trastuzumab emtansine group and 6·5 months (IQR 4·1-9·7) in the physician's choice group, 219 (54%) patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group and 129 (65%) of patients in the physician's choice group had PFS events. PFS was significantly improved with trastuzumab emtansine compared with physician's choice (median 6·2 months [95% CI 5·59-6·87] vs 3·3 months [2·89-4·14]; stratified hazard ratio [HR] 0·528 [0·422-0·661]; p<0·0001). Interim overall survival analysis showed a trend favouring trastuzumab emtansine (stratified HR 0·552 [95% CI 0·369-0·826]; p=0·0034), but the stopping boundary was not crossed. A lower incidence of grade 3 or worse adverse events was reported with trastuzumab emtansine than with physician's choice (130 events [32%] in 403 patients vs 80 events [43%] in 184 patients). Neutropenia (ten [2%] vs 29 [16%]), diarrhoea (three [<1%] vs eight [4%]), and febrile neutropenia (one [<1%] vs seven [4%]) were grade 3 or worse adverse events that were more common in the physician's choice group than in the trastuzumab emtansine group. Thrombocytopenia (19 [5%] vs three [2%]) was the grade 3 or worse adverse event that was more common in the trastuzumab emtansine group. 74 (18%) patients in the trastuzumab emtansine group and 38 (21%) in the physician's choice group reported a serious adverse event. Trastuzumab emtansine should be considered as a new standard for patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer who have previously received trastuzumab and lapatinib. Genentech.",cancer
828,"Phase I pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of the oral, small-molecule mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) in patients with advanced cancers.","To assess the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PKs), and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) in patients with advanced cancer. In part A, patients received escalating doses to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD). In both parts, blood samples were collected to assess PK and PD parameters. In part B, patients were stratified by cancer type (melanoma v other) and randomly assigned to receive the MTD or 50% MTD. Biopsies were collected to determine inhibition of ERK phosphorylation, Ki-67 expression, and BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS mutations. Fifty-seven patients were enrolled. MTD in part A was 200 mg bid, but this dose was discontinued in part B because of toxicity. The 50% MTD (100 mg bid) was well tolerated. Rash was the most frequent and dose-limiting toxicity. Most other adverse events were grade 1 or 2. The PKs were less than dose proportional, with a median half-life of approximately 8 hours and inhibition of ERK phosphorylation in peripheral-blood mononuclear cells at all dose levels. Paired tumor biopsies demonstrated reduced ERK phosphorylation (geometric mean, 79%). Five of 20 patients demonstrated >or= 50% inhibition of Ki-67 expression, and RAF or RAS mutations were detected in 10 of 26 assessable tumor samples. Nine patients had stable disease (SD) for >or= 5 months, including two patients with SD for 19 (thyroid cancer) and 22 (uveal melanoma plus renal cancer) 28-day cycles. AZD6244 was well tolerated with target inhibition demonstrated at the recommended phase II dose. PK analyses supported twice-daily dosing. Prolonged SD was seen in a variety of advanced cancers. Phase II studies are ongoing.",cancer
211,Oncogenic AKAP9-BRAF fusion is a novel mechanism of MAPK pathway activation in thyroid cancer.,"Genes crucial for cancer development can be mutated via various mechanisms, which may reflect the nature of the mutagen. In thyroid papillary carcinomas, mutations of genes coding for effectors along the MAPK pathway are central for transformation. BRAF point mutation is most common in sporadic tumors. By contrast, radiation-induced tumors are associated with paracentric inversions activating the receptor tyrosine kinases RET and NTRK1. We report here a rearrangement of BRAF via paracentric inversion of chromosome 7q resulting in an in-frame fusion between exons 1-8 of the AKAP9 gene and exons 9-18 of BRAF. The fusion protein contains the protein kinase domain and lacks the autoinhibitory N-terminal portion of BRAF. It has elevated kinase activity and transforms NIH3T3 cells, which provides evidence, for the first time to our knowledge, of in vivo activation of an intracellular effector along the MAPK pathway by recombination. The AKAP9-BRAF fusion was preferentially found in radiation-induced papillary carcinomas developing after a short latency, whereas BRAF point mutations were absent in this group. These data indicate that in thyroid cancer, radiation activates components of the MAPK pathway primarily through chromosomal paracentric inversions, whereas in sporadic forms of the disease, effectors along the same pathway are activated predominantly by point mutations.",cancer
2063,"Influence of Gestational Age, Secretor and Lewis Blood Group Status on the Oligosaccharide Content of Human Milk.","Human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) are considered to play an important role for the infant. As the biotechnical production of some HMOs is feasible today and clinical studies are being designed, the individual variation of the total amount of HMOs and of single components is of particular importance. Our objectives were to investigate whether differences exist between (i) term and preterm milk, (ii) milk from mothers with secretor or non-secretor status and (iii) a Lewis-blood group (a+b-), (a-b+) or (a-b-) pattern.|Within a longitudinal study 96 milk samples (colostrum, transitional and mature milk) from 32 mothers with preterm (n = 18) and term (n = 14) infants were collected. Delipidated and deproteinized milk was subjected to porous graphitized carbon cartridges followed by HPAEC-PAD.|Quantitation of 16 single HMOs revealed changes during the first weeks of lactation without discrepancies between term and preterm milk. Significant differences occurred between ""secretor"" and ""non-secretor"" milk (median about 10 versus 5 g/L total HMOs).

209,Integrated molecular analysis of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most prevalent kidney cancer and its molecular pathogenesis is incompletely understood. Here we report an integrated molecular study of ccRCC in which ≥100 ccRCC cases were fully analyzed by whole-genome and/or whole-exome and RNA sequencing as well as by array-based gene expression, copy number and/or methylation analyses. We identified a full spectrum of genetic lesions and analyzed gene expression and DNA methylation signatures and determined their impact on tumor behavior. Defective VHL-mediated proteolysis was a common feature of ccRCC, which was caused not only by VHL inactivation but also by new hotspot TCEB1 mutations, which abolished Elongin C-VHL binding, leading to HIF accumulation. Other newly identified pathways and components recurrently mutated in ccRCC included PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, the KEAP1-NRF2-CUL3 apparatus, DNA methylation, p53-related pathways and mRNA processing. This integrated molecular analysis unmasked new correlations between DNA methylation, gene mutation and/or gene expression and copy number profiles, enabling the stratification of clinical risks for patients with ccRCC.",cancer
660,"Activity and safety of ceritinib in patients with ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (ASCEND-1): updated results from the multicentre, open-label, phase 1 trial.","ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is sensitive to ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (ALK inhibitors) such as crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops, often with progression in the brain. Ceritinib is a more potent ALK inhibitor than crizotinib in vitro, crosses the blood-brain barrier in vivo, and shows clinical responses in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. We aimed to assess whole-body activity of ceritinib in both ALK inhibitor-pretreated and ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ASCEND-1 was an open-label, phase 1 trial that recruited patients from 20 academic hospitals or cancer centres in 11 countries in Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific. Eligible patients were aged 18 years or older with ALK-rearranged locally advanced or metastatic cancer that had progressed despite standard therapy (or for which no effective standard therapy existed), who had at least one measurable lesion at baseline. The primary objective (to determine the maximum tolerated dose) has been reported previously. This updated analysis includes all patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC given oral ceritinib at the recommended dose of 750 mg/day in the dose-escalation and expansion phases. Here we report the secondary outcomes of overall response, duration of response, and progression-free survival, analysed in all patients who received at least one 750 mg dose of ceritinib. Exploratory analyses included retrospective analysis of intracranial activity by independent neuroradiologists, in patients with untreated or locally treated neurologically stable brain metastases at baseline. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of ceritinib. This study is no longer recruiting patients; however, treatment and follow-up are ongoing. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01283516. Between Jan 24, 2011, and July 31, 2013, 255 patients were enrolled and received at least one dose of ceritinib 750 mg/day, of whom 246 had ALK-rearranged NSCLC. At data cutoff (April 14, 2014), median follow-up was 11·1 months (IQR 6·7-15·2) and 147 (60%) patients had discontinued treatment, 98 (40%) as a result of disease progression. An overall response was reported in 60 (72% [95% CI 61-82]) of 83 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 92 (56% [49-64]) of 163 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median duration of response was 17·0 months (95% CI 11·3-non-estimable [NE]) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 8·3 months (6·8-9·7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Median progression-free survival was 18·4 months (95% CI 11·1-NE) in ALK inhibitor-naive patients and 6·9 months (5·6-8·7) in ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Of 94 patients with retrospectively confirmed brain metastases and at least one post-baseline MRI or CT tumour assessment, intracranial disease control was reported in 15 (79% [95% CI 54-94]) of 19 ALK inhibitor-naive patients and in 49 (65% [54-76]) of 75 ALK inhibitor-pretreated patients. Of these 94 patients, 11 had measurable brain lesions and no previous radiotherapy to the brain, six of whom achieved a partial intracranial response. Serious adverse events were recorded in 117 (48%) of 246 patients. The most common grade 3-4 laboratory abnormalities were increased alanine aminotransferase (73 [30%] patients) and increased aspartate aminotransferase (25 [10%]). The most common grade 3-4 non-laboratory adverse events were diarrhoea and nausea, both of which occurred in 15 (6%) patients. Two on-treatment deaths during the study were deemed to be related to study drug by the investigators, one due to interstitial lung disease and one as a result of multiorgan failure that occurred in the context of infection and ischaemic hepatitis. The durable whole-body responses reported, together with the intracranial activity, support a clinical benefit for treatment with ceritinib in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC who have received crizotinib, or as an alternative to crizotinib. A confirmatory phase 2 clinical trial is ongoing to assess ceritinib activity in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC and brain or leptomeningeal metastases.

982,Evaluation of KIF23 variant 1 expression and relevance as a novel prognostic factor in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"KIF23 (kinesin family member 23) is a kinesin-like motor protein and plays an important role in cytokinesis. In search for genes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by cDNA microarray, we found that KIF23 was upregulated in HCC tissues. At present, much less is known about its expression and functions in tumor cells. In this work, we aimed to investigate the expression of KIF23 in HCC and the correlation between its expression and clinical features. Total RNA was extracted from 16 HCC and paired adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The expressions of the two KIF23 splice variants (KIF23 V1 and KIF23 V2) in normal and HCC tissues were determined by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Polyclonal antibody specific to KIF23 V1 was prepared, and the specificity of the antibody was confirmed by siRNA knockdown and Western blotting experiments. KIF23 protein expression in HCC was examined by immunohistochemistry staining with anti-KIF23 V1 or anti-KIF23 (commercially available for recognizing both KIF23 V1 and V2) antibodies, respectively. Univariate and Multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the correlation between KIF23 protein expression and overall survival of HCC patients. The two splicing variants of KIF23 mRNA were not detected in normal liver tissue by RT-PCR, but they were aberrantly expressed in HCC tissues. Immunohistochemistry staining with anti-KIF23 V1 antibody revealed that KIF23 V1 was mainly distributed in the nucleus, whereas the positive staining signals were predominantly in the cytoplasm when using anti-KIF23 antibody, suggesting that KIF23 V2 might localize in the cytoplasm of HCC cells. KIF23 V1 protein was detected in 57.6% (83/144) HCC patients and the mean H-score was 42, while KIF23 V2 was detected in 94.4% (135/143) HCC samples and the mean H-score was 68. Follow-up study showed that HCC patients with expression of KIF23 V1 had a longer 5-year survival (p=0.0052), however, expression of KIF23 V2 protein did not associate with 3- and 5-year survival. In this study we show for the first time that KIF23 V1 and V2 have different localizations in HCC cells. Furthermore, KIF23 V1 protein expression might be a marker of longer overall survival in HCC patients.",cancer
304,"FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression, not gene copy number, predict FGFR TKI sensitivity across all lung cancer histologies.","FGFR1 gene copy number (GCN) is being evaluated as a biomarker for FGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) response in squamous cell lung cancers (SCC). The exclusive use of FGFR1 GCN for predicting FGFR TKI sensitivity assumes increased GCN is the only mechanism for biologically relevant increases in FGFR1 signaling. Herein, we tested whether FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression may serve as better biomarkers of FGFR TKI sensitivity in lung cancer. Histologically diverse lung cancer cell lines were submitted to assays for ponatinib sensitivity, a potent FGFR TKI. A tissue microarray composed of resected lung tumors was submitted to FGFR1 GCN, and mRNA analyses and the results were validated with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung cancer data. Among 58 cell lines, 14 exhibited ponatinib sensitivity (IC50 values ≤ 50 nmol/L) that correlated with FGFR1 mRNA and protein expression, but not with FGFR1 GCN or histology. Moreover, ponatinib sensitivity associated with mRNA expression of the ligands, FGF2 and FGF9. In resected tumors, 22% of adenocarcinomas and 28% of SCCs expressed high FGFR1 mRNA. Importantly, only 46% of SCCs with increased FGFR1 GCN expressed high mRNA. Lung cancer TCGA data validated these findings and unveiled overlap of FGFR1 mRNA positivity with KRAS and PIK3CA mutations. FGFR1 dependency is frequent across various lung cancer histologies, and FGFR1 mRNA may serve as a better biomarker of FGFR TKI response in lung cancer than FGFR1 GCN. The study provides important and timely insight into clinical testing of FGFR TKIs in lung cancer and other solid tumor types.",cancer
699,Phase 2 trial of single-agent everolimus in chemotherapy-naive patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (SAKK 08/08).,"The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) tumor suppressor gene is deregulated in many advanced prostate cancers, leading to activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt-mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and thus increased cell survival. To evaluate everolimus, an inhibitor of mTOR, in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), and to explore potentially predictive serum biomarkers by proteomics, the significance of PTEN status in tumor tissue, and the impact of everolimus on immune cell subpopulations and function. A total of 37 chemotherapy-naive patients with mCRPC and progressive disease were recruited to this single-arm phase 2 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT00976755). Everolimus was administered continuously at a dose of 10mg daily. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 wk defined as the absence of prostate-specific antigen (PSA), radiographic progression, or clinical progression. Groups were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests or Fisher exact tests for continuous and discrete variables, respectively. Time-to-event end points were analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method and univariate Cox regression. A total of 13 patients (35%; 95% confidence interval, 20-53) met the primary end point. Confirmed PSA response ≥50% was seen in two (5%), and four further patients (11%) had a PSA decline ≥30%. Higher serum levels of carboxypeptidase M and apolipoprotein B were predictive for reaching the primary end point. Deletion of PTEN was associated with longer PFS and response. Treatment was associated with a dose-dependent decrease of CD3, CD4, and CD8 T lymphocytes and CD8 proliferation and an increase in regulatory T cells. Small sample size was the major limitation of the study. Everolimus activity in unselected patients with mCRPC is moderate, but PTEN deletion could be predictive for response. Several serum glycoproteins were able to predict PFS at 12 wk. Prospective validation of these potential biomarkers is warranted. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov with the identifier NCT00976755. Results of this study were presented in part at the 47th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (June 3-7, 2011; Chicago, IL, USA) and the annual meeting of the German, Austrian, and Swiss Societies for Oncology and Hematology (September 30-October 4, 2011; Basel, Switzerland).",cancer
1150,PIK3CA mutation is predictive of poor survival in patients with colorectal cancer.,"The PI3K-AKT pathway is activated in a variety of human cancers, resulting in disturbance of cell growth, proliferation and survival. Among the factors affecting the pathway, the K-Ras mutation and PIK3CA mutation are the most common oncogenic alterations in colorectal cancer. We hypothesized that these two mutations are important in activation of the PI3K pathway and colorectal carcinogenesis. In this study, we aimed to examine the influence of PIK3CA mutation and K-Ras mutation on AKT activation, and to clarify whether PIK3CA mutation, K-Ras mutation and p-AKT expression may be used as parameters for predicting prognosis in colorectal cancer. Tissue samples from 158 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection were examined. The sequences of exon 1 of K-Ras and exons 9 and 20 of PIK3CA were determined by direct sequencing using genomic DNA extracted from paraffin-embedded blocks. Activation status of AKT was evaluated by immunohistochemical staining using phospho-specific AKT antibody (Ser473). Correlation between these factors and clinicopathologic findings/patient survival were examined. As a result, PIK3CA mutation was significantly associated with shorter relapse-free survival (RFS) in stage II/III patients (p = 0.0216) and shorter disease-specific survival in all patients (p = 0.0357). In the multivariate analysis, PIK3CA mutation was the only independent and significant prognostic factor for RFS in stage II/III patients (p = 0.0433, HR 2.478). This study revealed the prognostic value of PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer patients. Patients with PIK3CA mutation should be followed up carefully. Moreover, our result suggests that inhibition of PIK3CA mutant may be a new molecular target therapy.",cancer
441,Schlafen-11 sensitizes colorectal carcinoma cells to irinotecan.,"Schlafen-11 (SLFN11) showed a highly significant positive correlation with the response of topoisomerase inhibitors in cancer cell lines derived from prostate, lung, etc. However, this finding has not been validated in colorectal cancers (CRCs). Although irinotecan (CPT-11), a topoisomerase inhibitor, is one of the most important drugs in the treatment of advanced and/or metastatic CRC, resistance is a critical drawback to its clinical effectiveness. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of SLFN11 in the response of CRC cell lines to SN-38 (an active CPT-11 metabolite) treatment. Western blotting was used to measure protein expression levels of SLFN11 in human CRC cell lines. Then, SLFN11 expression was modulated by transfecting human CRC cell lines with vectors carrying the SLFN11 gene or specific SLFN11 small interfering RNAs. The effects of SN-38 treatment on CRC cells with different SLFN11 expression levels were detected, including inhibition of cell growth, induction of apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. This study showed that SLFN11 expression varied between the CRC cell lines and high-level SLFN11 expression promoted SN-38-induced antiproliferative activity, apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. Our results suggest that SLFN11 plays a key role in cell cycle arrest and/or induction of apoptosis in response to exogenous SN-38-induced DNA damage and might be used as a new predictive biomarker for CRC treatment.",cancer

In this multicentre, single-arm, open-label, phase 1-2 study of CH5424802, we recruited ALK inhibitor-naive patients with ALK-rearranged advanced NSCLC from 13 hospitals in Japan. In the phase 1 portion of the study, patients received CH5424802 orally twice daily by dose escalation. The primary endpoints of the phase 1 were dose limiting toxicity (DLT), maximum tolerated dose (MTD), and pharmacokinetic parameters. In the phase 2 portion of the study, patients received CH5424802 at the recommended dose identified in the phase 1 portion of the study orally twice a day. The primary endpoint of the phase 2 was the proportion of patients who had an objective response. Treatment was continued in 21-day cycles until disease progression, intolerable adverse events, or withdrawal of consent. The analysis was done by intent to treat. This study is registered with the Japan Pharmaceutical Information Center, number JapicCTI-101264. Patients were enrolled between Sept 10, 2010, and April 18, 2012. The data cutoff date was July 31, 2012. In the phase 1 portion, 24 patients were treated at doses of 20-300 mg twice daily. No DLTs or adverse events of grade 4 were noted up to the highest dose; thus 300 mg twice daily was the recommended phase 2 dose. In the phase 2 portion of the study, 46 patients were treated with the recommended dose, of whom 43 achieved an objective response (93.5%, 95% CI 82.1-98.6) including two complete responses (4.3%, 0.5-14.8) and 41 partial responses (89.1%, 76.4-96.4). Treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 were recorded in 12 (26%) of 46 patients, including two patients each experiencing decreased neutrophil count and increased blood creatine phosphokinase. Serious adverse events occurred in five patients (11%). No grade 4 adverse events or deaths were reported. The study is still ongoing, since 40 of the 46 patients in the phase 2 portion remain on treatment. CH5424802 is well tolerated and highly active in patients with advanced ALK-rearranged NSCLC.

Behavioral results showed decreased accuracy for the fearful faces compared with neutral and happy faces. Event-related potential data showed that compared with the neutral and happy faces, fearful faces appearing in the right visual field elicited enhanced contralateral P1 amplitudes in the unattended condition, whereas fearful faces appearing in the left visual field elicited decreased contralateral N170 activity in the attended condition. These findings provide evidence for differential emotional processing under spatial attended and unattended conditions.",nonCancer
36,Prognostic significance of somatic RET oncogene mutations in sporadic medullary thyroid cancer: a 10-year follow-up study.,"Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is a well-differentiated thyroid tumor that maintains the typical features of C cells. An advanced stage and the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis have been demonstrated to be the most important bad prognostic factors. Somatic RET mutations have been found in 40-50% of MTCs. Although a relationship between somatic mutations and bad prognosis has been described, data are controversial and have been performed in small series with short-term follow ups. The aim of this study was to verify the prognostic value of somatic RET mutations in a large series of MTCs with a long follow up. We studied 100 sporadic MTC patients with a 10.2 yr mean follow-up. RET gene exons 10-11 and 13-16 were analyzed. The correlation between the presence/absence of a somatic RET mutation, clinical/pathological features, and outcome of MTC patients was evaluated. A somatic RET mutation was found in 43 of 100 (43%) sporadic MTCs. The most frequent mutation (34 of 43, 79%) was M918T. RET mutation occurrence was more frequent in larger tumors (P=0.03), and in MTC with node and distant metastases (P<0.0001 and P=0.02, respectively), thus, a significant correlation was found with a more advanced stage at diagnosis (P=0.004). A worse outcome was also significantly correlated with the presence of a somatic RET mutation (P=0.002). Among all prognostic factors found to be correlated with a worse outcome, at multivariate analysis only the advanced stage at diagnosis and the presence of a RET mutation showed an independent correlation (P<0.0001 and P=0.01, respectively). Finally, the survival curves of MTC patients showed a significantly lower percentage of surviving patients in the group with RET mutations (P=0.006). We demonstrated that the presence of a somatic RET mutation correlates with a worse outcome of MTC patients, not only for the highest probability to have persistence of the disease, but also for a lower survival rate in a long-term follow up. More interestingly, the presence of a somatic RET mutation correlates with the presence of lymph node metastases at diagnosis, which is a known bad prognostic factor for the definitive cure of MTC patients.",cancer
1094,FGF3/FGF4 amplification and multiple lung metastases in responders to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"The response rate to sorafenib in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is relatively low (0.7%-3%), however, rapid and drastic tumor regression is occasionally observed. The molecular backgrounds and clinico-pathological features of these responders remain largely unclear. We analyzed the clinical and molecular backgrounds of 13 responders to sorafenib with significant tumor shrinkage in a retrospective study. A comparative genomic hybridization analysis using one frozen HCC sample from a responder demonstrated that the 11q13 region, a rare amplicon in HCC including the loci for FGF3 and FGF4, was highly amplified. A real-time polymerase chain reaction-based copy number assay revealed that FGF3/FGF4 amplification was observed in three of the 10 HCC samples from responders in which DNA was evaluable, whereas amplification was not observed in 38 patients with stable or progressive disease (P = 0.006). Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis confirmed FGF3 amplification. In addition, the clinico-pathological features showed that multiple lung metastases (5/13, P = 0.006) and a poorly differentiated histological type (5/13, P = 0.13) were frequently observed in responders. A growth inhibitory assay showed that only one FGF3/FGF4-amplified and three FGFR2-amplified cancer cell lines exhibited hypersensitivity to sorafenib in vitro. Finally, an in vivo study revealed that treatment with a low dose of sorafenib was partially effective for stably and exogenously expressed FGF4 tumors, while being less effective in tumors expressing EGFP or FGF3. FGF3/FGF4 amplification was observed in around 2% of HCCs. Although the sample size was relatively small, FGF3/FGF4 amplification, a poorly differentiated histological type, and multiple lung metastases were frequently observed in responders to sorafenib. Our findings may provide a novel insight into the molecular background of HCC and sorafenib responders, warranting further prospective biomarker studies.",cancer

Patients were required to have received irinotecan, either alone or in a combination regimen, and to have demonstrated clinical failure on this regimen before study entry. Cetuximab was administered weekly by intravenous infusion. The first dose of 400 mg/m(2) was given during the course of 2 hours. Subsequent weekly treatments were given at a dose of 250 mg/m(2) during the course of 1 hour. Fifty-seven eligible patients were treated. All were assessable for toxicity and response. The most commonly encountered grade 3 to 4 adverse events, regardless of relationship to study drug, were an acne-like skin rash, predominantly on the face and upper torso (86% with any grade; 18% with grade 3), and a composite of asthenia, fatigue, malaise, or lethargy (56% with any grade, 9% with grade 3). Two patients (3.5%) experienced grade 3 allergic reactions requiring discontinuation of study treatment. A third patient experienced a grade 3 allergic reaction that resolved, and the patient continued on the study. Neither diarrhea nor neutropenia were dose limiting in any of the 57 patients treated. Five patients (9%; 95% CI, 3% to 19%) achieved a partial response. Twenty-one additional patients had stable disease or minor responses. The median survival in these previously treated patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer is 6.4 months. Cetuximab on this once-weekly schedule has modest activity and is well-tolerated as a single agent in patients with chemotherapy-refractory colorectal cancer whose tumors express the epidermal growth factor receptor. Further studies of cetuximab will evaluate the use of cetuximab in conjunction with first-line and adjuvant treatments for this disease.",cancer
1557,The Influence of Gestational Diabetes on Neurodevelopment of Children in the First Two Years of Life: A Prospective Study.,"Analyze the relation of gestational diabetes and maternal blood glucose levels to early cognitive functions in the first two years of life.|In a prospective Singaporean birth cohort study, pregnant women were screened for gestational diabetes at 26-28 weeks gestation using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Four hundred and seventy three children (n = 74 and n = 399 born to mothers with and without gestational diabetes respectively) underwent neurocognitive assessments at 6, 18, and/or 24 month, including electrophysiology during an attentional task and behavioral measures of attention, memory and cognition.|Gestational diabetes is related to left hemisphere EPmax amplitude differences (oddball versus standard) at both six (P = 0.039) and eighteen months (P = 0.039), with mean amplitudes suggesting offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes exhibit greater neuronal activity to standard stimuli and less to oddball stimuli. Associations between 2-hour maternal glucose levels and the difference in EPmax amplitude were marginal at 6 months [adjusted β = -0.19 (95% CI: -0.42 to +0.04) μV, P = 0.100] and significant at 18 months [adjusted β = -0.27 (95% CI: -0.49 to -0.06) μV, P = 0.014], and the EPmax amplitude difference (oddball-standard) associated with the Bayley Scales of Infant and toddler Development-III cognitive score at 24 months [β = 0.598 (95% CI: 0.158 to 1.038), P = 0.008].|Gestational diabetes and maternal blood glucose levels are associated with offspring neuronal activity during an attentional task at both six and eighteen months. Such electrophysiological differences are likely functionally important, having been previously linked to attention problems later in life.",nonCancer
2264,Mitochondrial Copy Number and D-Loop Variants in Pompe Patients.,"Pompe disease is a rare neuromuscular genetic disorder and is classified into two forms of early and late-onset. Over the past two decades, mitochondrial abnor- malities have been recognized as an important contributor to an array of neuromuscular diseases. We therefore aimed to compare mitochondrial copy number and mitochondrial displacement-loop sequence variation in infantile and adult Pompe patients.|In this retrospective study, the mitochondrial D-loop sequence was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing to detect pos- sible variation in 28 Pompe patients (17 infants and 11 adults). Results were compared with 100 healthy controls and sequences of all individuals were compared with the Cam- bridge reference sequence. Real-time PCR was used to quantify mitochondrial DNA copy number.|Among 59 variants identified, 37(62.71%) were present in the infant group, 14(23.333%) in the adult group and 8(13.333%) in both groups. Mitochondrial copy number in infant patients was lower than adults (P<0.05). A significant frequency differ- ence was seen between the two groups for 12 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). A novel insertion (317-318 ins CCC) was observed in patients and six SNPs were iden- tified as neutral variants in controls. There was an inverse association between mito- chondrial copy number and D-loop variant number (r=0.54).|The 317-318 ins CCC was detected as a new mitochondrial variant in Pompe patients.",nonCancer
1533,A small multimarker panel using simple immunohistochemistry methods is an adjunct to stage for cutaneous melanoma prognosis.,"Melanoma is an aggressive cancer. Outcomes can vary significantly for lesions within the same pathological stage - a problem of increasing relevance with the promise of adjuvant treatments on the basis of immune checkpoint modulators and targeted therapies. The use of a panel of prognostic molecular biomarkers as an adjunct to stage represents a possible solution. Immunohistochemistry-based biomarkers offer greater potential for translation into clinical practice than biomarkers utilizing more complex methods. Many immunohistochemistry-based biomarkers have been identified through discovery studies, but rigorous validation of these is scarce. We take the first steps towards validating a combination of three such biomarkers in a prognostic panel - 5hmC, ki-67 and p16. Immunohistochemistry was performed on a cohort of 50 melanomas to determine the expression of 5hmC, ki-67 and p16. 5hmC and p16 showed statistically significant differences in metastasis-free survival between low-score and high-score groups, whereas the use of all three biomarkers together with stage could predict the 5-year metastasis risk more accurately than stage alone. Our results suggest that the use of multimarker panels to improve the accuracy of prognostic predictions is feasible and worthy of further study. We have shown that a small immunohistochemistry-based panel utilizing simple, inexpensive, reproducible methods can be an effective adjunct to stage in prognostic prediction. A follow-up study consisting of a large cohort of melanomas is now indicated to continue the development of the prognostic panel.",nonCancer
245,SMAD4 gene mutations are associated with poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer.,"Recently, the majority of protein coding genes were sequenced in a collection of pancreatic cancers, providing an unprecedented opportunity to identify genetic markers of prognosis for patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. We previously sequenced more than 750 million base pairs of DNA from 23,219 transcripts in a series of 24 adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. In addition, 39 genes that were mutated in more than one of these 24 cancers were sequenced in a separate panel of 90 well-characterized adenocarcinomas of the pancreas. Of these 114 patients, 89 underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, and the somatic mutations in these cancers were correlated with patient outcome. When adjusted for age, lymph node status, margin status, and tumor size, SMAD4 gene inactivation was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-3.05; P = 0.006). Patients with SMAD4 gene inactivation survived a median of 11.5 months, compared with 14.2 months for patients without SMAD4 inactivation. By contrast, mutations in CDKN2A or TP53 or the presence of multiple (> or =4) mutations or homozygous deletions among the 39 most frequently mutated genes were not associated with survival. SMAD4 gene inactivation is associated with poorer prognosis in patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.",cancer
1724,Two-Dimensional Mesoscale-Ordered Conducting Polymers.,"Despite the availability of numerous two-dimensional (2D) materials with structural ordering at the atomic or molecular level, direct construction of mesoscale-ordered superstructures within a 2D monolayer remains an enormous challenge. Here, we report the synergic manipulation of two types of assemblies in different dimensions to achieve 2D conducting polymer nanosheets with structural ordering at the mesoscale. The supramolecular assemblies of amphipathic perfluorinated carboxylic acids and block co-polymers serve as 2D interfaces and meso-inducing moieties, respectively, which guide the polymerization of aniline into 2D, free-standing mesoporous conducting polymer nanosheets. Grazing-incidence small-angle X-ray scattering combined with various microscopy demonstrates that the resulting mesoscale-ordered nanosheets have hexagonal lattice with d-spacing of about 30 nm, customizable pore sizes of 7-18 nm and thicknesses of 13-45 nm, and high surface area. Such template-directed assembly produces polyaniline nanosheets with enhanced π-π stacking interactions, thereby resulting in anisotropic and record-high electrical conductivity of approximately 41 S cm(-1) for the pristine polyaniline nanosheet based film and approximately 188 S cm(-1) for the hydrochloric acid-doped counterpart. Our moldable approach creates a new family of mesoscale-ordered structures as well as opens avenues to the programmed assembly of multifunctional materials.",nonCancer
775,ASXL1 exon 12 mutations are frequent in AML with intermediate risk karyotype and are independently associated with an adverse outcome.,"We aimed at evaluating ASXL1mut in 740 AML with intermediate risk karyotype for frequency, association with other mutations and impact on outcome. Five hundred fifty-three cases had a normal karyotype (NK) and 187 had intermediate risk aberrant cytogenetics. Overall, ASXL1mut were detected in 127/740 patients (17.2%). ASXL1mut were more frequent in males than in females (23.5% vs 9.9%, P<0.001). They were associated with higher age (median: 71.8 vs 61.8, P<0.001), a history of preceding myelodysplastic syndromes, and with a more immature immunophenotype compared with patients with wild-type ASXL1 (ASXL1wt). ASXL1mut were more frequent in patients with aberrant karyotype (58/187; 31.0%), especially in cases with trisomy 8 (39/74; 52.7%), than in those with NK (69/553; 12.5%; P<0.001). ASXL1mut were observed more frequent in RUNX1mut (P<0.001), and less frequent in NPM1mut (P<0.001), FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD) (P<0.001), FLT3-TKD (P=0.001) and DNMT3Amut (P<0.001). Patients with ASXL1mut had a shorter overall survival (OS) (P<0.001) and event free survival (P=0.012) compared with ASXL1wt. In multivariable analysis, ASXL1mut was an independent adverse factor for OS (P=0.032, relative risk: 1.70). In conclusion, ASXL1mut belong to the most frequent mutations in intermediate risk group AML. Their strong and independent dismal prognostic impact suggests the inclusion into the diagnostic work-up of AML.",cancer
1122,Prognostic significance of K-ras mutations in colorectal carcinoma.,"Mutations at codons 12, 13, and 61 of the ras genes have been found in a variety of human tumors and may have prognostic significance. K-ras mutations have been shown in 40%-50% of colorectal cancers. Using a simple nonradioactive polymerase chain reaction-based technique, we have investigated the possible prognostic significance of point mutations of the K-ras gene in patients with human colorectal carcinomas. The prevalence and the type of ras mutations were compared between a group of 35 patients having recurrent disease within 5 years and a group of 64 patients who were disease free 5 years following surgery. First, we found that the overall prevalence of mutations within codons 12 and 13 of the K-ras gene was 25% in the nonrecurring group vs. 71% in the patients with recurrent disease (P < 0.0001) and, second, that mutations other than GGT to GAT occurred, with one exception, exclusively in recurring tumors. In Dukes' B and C primary tumors, mutations other than GGT to GAT identify patients at very high risk for recurrence. Our results indicate that determining the K-ras mutations provides a good prognostic factor in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma.",cancer
956,Antimyeloma activity of bromodomain inhibitors on the human myeloma cell line U266 by downregulation of MYCL.,"Bromodomain and extraterminal protein (BET) inhibitors suppress the expression of c-MYC. U266, a human myeloma cell line, expresses the MYCL gene, but not the c-MYC gene. Our aim was to analyse the antimyeloma activity of BET inhibitors on U266 cells. Two BET inhibitors, I-BET151 and JQ1, were tested. U266 cell proliferation decreased to 61.5 and 54.0% of the control after incubation with 500 nmol/l I-BET151 for 72 and 96 h and to 53.5 and 56.4% of control after incubation with 500 nmol/l JQ1 for 72 and 96 h by MTS tetrazolium, respectively. BET inhibitors induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase in U266 cells, but did not induce apoptosis by flow cytometry. According to Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, MYC-related genes were significantly downregulated in U266 cells treated with I-BET151 similar to KMS11 cells that expressed c-MYC. The MYCL1 was expressed in U266 cells, whereas c-MYC and MYCN were not by quantitative real-time reverse-transcription-PCR. Incubation with I-BET151 induced downregulation of MYCL1 in U266 cells. BET inhibitors decreased the cell proliferation in U266 cells with overexpression of MYCL less than those without overexpression of MYCL. BET inhibitors induce G1 arrest without apoptosis and interfere with the proliferation of U266 myeloma cells, which express MYCL, but not c-MYC. BET inhibitors might be active in cancers that express MYCL, but not c-MYC.",cancer
1585,Quantification and comparison of 4D-flow MRI-derived wall shear stress and MRE-derived wall stiffness of the abdominal aorta.,"Aortic wall shear stress (WSSFlow ) alters endothelial function, which in-turn changes aortic wall stiffness leading to remodeling in different disease states. Therefore, the aims of this study are to determine normal physiologic correlations between: (1) Magnetic Resonance Elastography (MRE)-derived aortic wall stiffness (WSMRE ) and WSSFlow ; (2) WSMRE and mean velocity; (3) WSMRE and pulse wave velocity (PWV);( 4) WSMRE and mean peak flow; and (5) WSMRE , WSSFlow and age using MRE and 4D-flow MRI in the abdominal aorta in healthy human subjects.|Cardiac-gated aortic MRE and 4D-flow MRI data were acquired in 24 healthy volunteers using a 3 Tesla scanner. For MRE, 70 Hz external motion was applied to obtain wave images in all spatial directions in a separate breathhold. Whereas, 4D-flow data was acquired under free-breathing. Wave images in all the directions were processed to obtain three-dimensional-weighted stiffness map at end-systole (ES). WSSFlow , mean velocity, PWV and mean peak flow were obtained using 4D-flow data. Pearson correlation was performed to determine association between all variables.|A significant negative correlation was observed between: (1) ES WSMRE and WSSFlow in both axial (r = -0.62; P = 0.006) and circumferential (r = -0.52; P = 0.016) directions; (2) ES WSMRE and mean velocity (r = -0.58; P = 0.012); and (3) age and WSSFlow in both axial (r = -0.71; P < 0.0001) and circumferential (r = -0.58; P = 0.0012) directions. A significant positive correlation was observed between: (1) ES WSMRE and PWV (r = 0.69; P < 0.0001); (2) ES WSMRE and mean peak flow (r = 0.53; P = 0.016); and (3) ES WSMRE and age (r = 0.63;P = 0.006).|The negative significant correlation between aortic WSSFlow and WSMRE in normal volunteers demonstrates a relationship between WSMRE and WSSFlow .|2J.

1871,Monitoring Radiofrequency Ablation Using Ultrasound Envelope Statistics and Shear Wave Elastography in the Periablation Period: An In Vitro Feasibility Study.,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a minimally invasive method for treating tumors. Shear wave elastography (SWE) has been widely applied in evaluating tissue stiffness and final ablation size after RFA. However, the usefulness of periablation SWE imaging in assessing RFA remains unclear. Therefore, this study investigated the correlation between periablation SWE imaging and final ablation size. An in vitro porcine liver model was used for experimental validation (n = 36). During RFA with a power of 50 W, SWE images were collected using a clinical ultrasound system. To evaluate the effects of tissue temperature and gas bubbles during RFA, changes in the ablation temperature were recorded, and image echo patterns were measured using B-mode and ultrasound statistical parametric images. After RFA, the gross pathology of each tissue sample was compared with the region of change in the corresponding periablation SWE image. The experimental results showed that the tissue temperature at the ablation site varied between 70°C and 100°C. Hyperechoic regions and changes were observed in the echo amplitude distribution induced by gas bubbles. Under this condition, the confounding effects (including the temperature increase, tissue stiffness increase, and presence of gas bubbles) resulted in artifacts in the periablation SWE images, and the corresponding region correlated with the estimated final ablation size obtained from the gross pathology (r = 0.8). The findings confirm the feasibility of using periablation SWE imaging in assessing RFA.",nonCancer
277,Rociletinib in EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a mutation in the gene encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is sensitive to approved EGFR inhibitors, but resistance develops, mediated by the T790M EGFR mutation in most cases. Rociletinib (CO-1686) is an EGFR inhibitor active in preclinical models of EGFR-mutated NSCLC with or without T790M. In this phase 1-2 study, we administered rociletinib to patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC who had disease progression during previous treatment with an existing EGFR inhibitor. In the expansion (phase 2) part of the study, patients with T790M-positive disease received rociletinib at a dose of 500 mg twice daily, 625 mg twice daily, or 750 mg twice daily. Key objectives were assessment of safety, side-effect profile, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary antitumor activity of rociletinib. Tumor biopsies to identify T790M were performed during screening. Treatment was administered in continuous 21-day cycles. A total of 130 patients were enrolled. The first 57 patients to be enrolled received the free-base form of rociletinib (150 mg once daily to 900 mg twice daily). The remaining patients received the hydrogen bromide salt (HBr) form (500 mg twice daily to 1000 mg twice daily). A maximum tolerated dose (the highest dose associated with a rate of dose-limiting toxic effects of less than 33%) was not identified. The only common dose-limiting adverse event was hyperglycemia. In an efficacy analysis that included patients who received free-base rociletinib at a dose of 900 mg twice daily or the HBr form at any dose, the objective response rate among the 46 patients with T790M-positive disease who could be evaluated was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45 to 73), and the rate among the 17 patients with T790M-negative disease who could be evaluated was 29% (95% CI, 8 to 51). Rociletinib was active in patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC associated with the T790M resistance mutation. (Funded by Clovis Oncology; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01526928.).",cancer
414,Epidermal growth factor is a potential biomarker for poor cetuximab response in tongue cancer cells.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is frequently associated with aberrant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, which contributes to tumor growth. Here, the functional importance of EGFR ligands in relation to proliferation and sensitivity to the EGFR-targeted therapy cetuximab was investigated in three tongue cancer cell lines. The influence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), amphiregulin (AR), and epiregulin (EPR) on tumor cell proliferation and cetuximab response was evaluated by the addition of recombinant human (rh) proteins or by siRNA-mediated downregulation of the endogenous ligand production. The expression, activation and cellular distribution of EGFR were assessed by Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. EGF downregulation suppressed the proliferation of all investigated tumor cell lines, whereas the response to an increased level of EGF differed between EGFR-overexpressing and EGFR-non-overexpressing cell lines. Furthermore, tumor cells consistently displayed increased cetuximab resistance upon the addition of rhEGF, whereas EGF silencing was associated with an improved cetuximab response. The data regarding AR and EPR were inconclusive. Our data suggest that the amount of EGF is a determinant of the tumor cell proliferation rate and the response to cetuximab treatment in tongue cancer. Thus, EGF is a potential predictive biomarker of poor cetuximab response and a possible treatment target.",cancer

Two dominant bacterial genera were identified by mass sequencing: the obligate symbiont Candidatus Sulcia, and a facultative symbiont that is closely related to Pectobacterium sp. and to BEV, a cultivable symbiont of another phytoplasma vector, the leafhopper Euscelidius variegatus. In addition, one bacterium was successfully isolated in this study - a member of the family Xanthomonadaceae that is most closely related to the genus Dyella. This Dyella-like bacterium (DLB) was detected by FISH analysis in H. obsoletus guts but not ovaries, and its prevalence in H. obsoletus increased during the fall, suggesting that it was acquired by the host through feeding. We found that DLB inhibits Spiroplasma melliferum, a cultivable relative of phytoplasma, suggesting that it is a potential candidate for biological control against phytoplasma in grapevines.",nonCancer

We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of afatinib and gefitinib in this setting. This multicentre, international, open-label, exploratory, randomised controlled phase 2B trial (LUX-Lung 7) was done at 64 centres in 13 countries. Treatment-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and a common EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or Leu858Arg) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive afatinib (40 mg per day) or gefitinib (250 mg per day) until disease progression, or beyond if deemed beneficial by the investigator. Randomisation, stratified by EGFR mutation type and status of brain metastases, was done centrally using a validated number generating system implemented via an interactive voice or web-based response system with a block size of four. Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. Coprimary endpoints were progression-free survival by independent central review, time-to-treatment failure, and overall survival. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01466660. Between Dec 13, 2011, and Aug 8, 2013, 319 patients were randomly assigned (160 to afatinib and 159 to gefitinib). Median follow-up was 27·3 months (IQR 15·3-33·9). Progression-free survival (median 11·0 months [95% CI 10·6-12·9] with afatinib vs 10·9 months [9·1-11·5] with gefitinib; hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·57-0·95], p=0·017) and time-to-treatment failure (median 13·7 months [95% CI 11·9-15·0] with afatinib vs 11·5 months [10·1-13·1] with gefitinib; HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·58-0·92], p=0·0073) were significantly longer with afatinib than with gefitinib. Overall survival data are not mature. The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events were diarrhoea (20 [13%] of 160 patients given afatinib vs two [1%] of 159 given gefitinib) and rash or acne (15 [9%] patients given afatinib vs five [3%] of those given gefitinib) and liver enzyme elevations (no patients given afatinib vs 14 [9%] of those given gefitinib). Serious treatment-related adverse events occurred in 17 (11%) patients in the afatinib group and seven (4%) in the gefitinib group. Ten (6%) patients in each group discontinued treatment due to drug-related adverse events. 15 (9%) fatal adverse events occurred in the afatinib group and ten (6%) in the gefitinib group. All but one of these deaths were considered unrelated to treatment; one patient in the gefitinib group died from drug-related hepatic and renal failure. Afatinib significantly improved outcomes in treatment-naive patients with EGFR-mutated NSCLC compared with gefitinib, with a manageable tolerability profile. These data are potentially important for clinical decision making in this patient population. Boehringer Ingelheim.",cancer

Mechanisms of resistance to everolimus remain undefined. Resistance developed in a patient with metastatic anaplastic thyroid carcinoma after an extraordinary 18-month response. Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment and drug-resistant tumors revealed a nonsense mutation in TSC2, a negative regulator of mTOR, suggesting a mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus. The resistant tumor also harbored a mutation in MTOR that confers resistance to allosteric mTOR inhibition. The mutation remains sensitive to mTOR kinase inhibitors.",cancer
14,BRAF and NRAS mutations in melanoma: potential relationships to clinical response to HSP90 inhibitors.,"Oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations are frequent in malignant melanoma. BRAF that is activated by the common V600E and other mutations, as well as by upstream NRAS mutations, has been shown to require the molecular chaperone heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) for stabilization and is depleted by the HSP90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG)]. Here, we explore the possible relationship between tumor BRAF and NRAS mutations and clinical response to 17-AAG in six patients with metastatic malignant melanoma who received pharmacologically active doses of 17-AAG as part of a phase I clinical trial. One patient with disease stabilization for 49 months had a (G13D)NRAS mutation and (WT)BRAF. A second patient who had stable disease for 15 months had a (V600E)BRAF mutation and (WT)NRAS. These preliminary results suggest that BRAF and NRAS mutation status should be determined in prospective phase II studies of HSP90 inhibitors in melanoma.",cancer
748,Penetrance analysis of the PALB2 c.1592delT founder mutation.,"PALB2 is a recently identified breast cancer susceptibility gene. We have previously identified in the Finnish population a PALB2 c.1592delT founder truncation mutation that is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. In the present study, we wanted to assess in more detail the increased risk (hazard ratio, HR) and the age-specific cumulative risk (penetrance) of c.1592delT with regard to susceptibility to breast and other forms of cancer. Modified segregation analyses fitted under maximum likelihood theory were used to estimate age-specific cumulative risks and HRs using the families of mutation carriers identified from a consecutive series of breast cancer cases unselected for age at onset or family history. We found a substantially increased risk of breast cancer [HR, 6.1; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 2.2-17.2; P = 0.01] equivalent to a 40% (95% CI, 17-77) breast cancer risk by age 70 years, comparable to that for carriers of mutations in BRCA2. We found marginal evidence (P = 0.06) that the HR for breast cancer decreased with age by 4.2% per year (95% CI, 0.2-8.1), from 7.5-fold at age 30 years to 2.0-fold at age 60 years. Our results suggest that it may be appropriate to offer PALB2 c.1592delT mutation testing to Finnish women with breast cancer, especially those with an early age at onset or a family history of breast or related cancers, and to offer carriers the option of participation in extended disease surveillance programs.",cancer
403,WEE1 kinase polymorphism as a predictive biomarker for efficacy of platinum-gemcitabine doublet chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"DNA-damaging agents are commonly used for first-line chemotherapy of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a G2/M checkpoint kinase, Wee1 can phosphorylate CDC2-tyr15 and induce G2/M cell cycle arrest in response to DNA damage. The correlation of WEE1 polymorphisms to the efficacy of chemotherapy was tested in 663 advanced NSCLC patients. WEE1 rs3910384 genotype correlated to overall survival (OS) and progress-free survival (PFS) of NSCLC patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Sub-group analysis revealed that rs3910384 was particularly associated with the efficacy of doublet chemotherapy combining two DNA-damaging agents, i.e. platinum and gemcitabine. NSCLC patients with the WEE1 rs3910384 G/G homozygote genotype showed 13.5 months extended OS, 3.2 months extended PFS, and a 274% relative increase in their 3-year survival rate (from 7.4% to 27.7%) compared to the A/A+A/G genotype after treatment with platinum-gemcitabine regimen. This finding was reproduced in the validation cohort. We utilized a luciferase reporter assay and Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) to demonstrate that rs3910384-linked WEE1 promoter haplotype can mediate allele-specific transcriptional binding and WEE1 expression in DNA damage response. In conclusion, the WEE1 rs3910384 G/G homozygote genotype can be used as a selective biomarker for NSCLC patients to indicate treatment with platinum and gemcitabine regimen.",cancer
2385,Name recognition in autism: EEG evidence of altered patterns of brain activity and connectivity.,"Impaired orienting to social stimuli is one of the core early symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, in contrast to faces, name processing has rarely been studied in individuals with ASD. Here, we investigated brain activity and functional connectivity associated with recognition of names in the high-functioning ASD group and in the control group.|EEG was recorded in 15 young males with ASD and 15 matched one-to-one control individuals. EEG data were analyzed with the event-related potential (ERP), event-related desynchronization and event-related synchronization (ERD/S), as well as coherence and direct transfer function (DTF) methods. Four categories of names were presented visually: one's own, close-other's, famous, and unknown.|Differences between the ASD and control groups were found for ERP, coherence, and DTF. In individuals with ASD, P300 (a positive ERP component) to own-name and to a close-other's name were similar whereas in control participants, P300 to own-name was enhanced when compared to all other names. Analysis of coherence and DTF revealed disruption of fronto-posterior task-related connectivity in individuals with ASD within the beta range frequencies. Moreover, DTF indicated the directionality of those impaired connections-they were going from parieto-occipital to frontal regions. DTF also showed inter-group differences in short-range connectivity: weaker connections within the frontal region and stronger connections within the occipital region in the ASD group in comparison to the control group.|Our findings suggest a lack of the self-preference effect and impaired functioning of the attentional network during recognition of visually presented names in individuals with ASD.",nonCancer
1355,Mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of isolated impaired glucose tolerance in humans.,"Prediabetes is a heterogeneous disorder classified on the basis of fasting glucose concentrations and 2-hour glucose tolerance.|We sought to determine the relative contributions of insulin secretion and action to the pathogenesis of isolated impaired glucose tolerance (NFG/IGT).|The study consisted of an oral glucose tolerance test and a euglycemic clamp performed in two cohorts matched for anthropometric characteristics and fasting glucose but discordant for glucose tolerance.|An Inpatient Clinical Research Unit at an academic medical center.|25 subjects who had normal fasting glucose and normal glucose tolerance (NFG/NGT) and 19 NFG/IGT subjects participated in this study.|Subjects underwent a 7-sample oral glucose tolerance test and a 4-hr euglycemic, hyperinsulinemic clamp on separate occasions.

Insulin-stimulated glucose disappearance was lower in NFG/IGT (24.6 ± 2.2 vs. 35.0 ± 3.6 μmol/kg/min, p = 0.03). The Disposition Index was decreased in NFG/IGT (681 ± 102 vs. 2231 ± 413 10(-14) dl/kg/min(2) per pmol/l, p<0.001).|We conclude that innate defects in the regulation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis do not contribute to NFG/IGT.

384,Reactivation of ERK signaling causes resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors.,"The clinical efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors is limited by the development of drug resistance. The irreversible EGFR kinase inhibitor WZ4002 is effective against the most common mechanism of drug resistance mediated by the EGFR T790M mutation. Here, we show, in multiple complementary models, that resistance to WZ4002 develops through aberrant activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling caused by either an amplification of mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (MAPK1) or by downregulation of negative regulators of ERK signaling. Inhibition of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) or ERK restores sensitivity to WZ4002 and prevents the emergence of drug resistance. We further identify MAPK1 amplification in an erlotinib-resistant EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung carcinoma patient. In addition, the WZ4002-resistant MAPK1-amplified cells also show an increase both in EGFR internalization and a decrease in sensitivity to cytotoxic chemotherapy. Our findings provide insights into mechanisms of drug resistance to EGFR kinase inhibitors and highlight rational combination therapies that should be evaluated in clinical trials.",cancer
1708,Amoxicillin and Clavulanate Forms Chemically and Immunologically Distinct Multiple Haptenic Structures in Patients.,"Amoxicillin-clavulanate (AC) is one of the most common causes of drug induced liver injury (DILI). The association between AC-DILI and HLA alleles and the detection of drug-specific T cells in patients with AC-DILI indicate that the adaptive immune system is involved in the disease pathogenesis. In this study, mass spectrometric methods were employed to characterize the antigen formed by AC in exposed patients and the antigenic determinants that stimulate T cells. Amoxicillin formed penicilloyl adducts with lysine residues on human serum albumin (HSA) in vitro, with K190 and K199 being the most reactive sites. Amoxicillin-modified K190 and K199 have also been detected in all patients, and more extensive modification was observed in patients exposed to higher doses of amoxicillin. In contrast, the binding of clavulanic acid to HSA was more complicated. Multiple adducts were identified at high concentrations in vitro, including those formed by direct binding of clavulanic acid to lysine residues, novel pyrazine adducts derived from binding to the degradation products of clavulanic acid, and a cross-linking adduct. Stable adducts derived from formylacetic acid were detected in all patients exposed to the drug. Importantly, analysis of hapten-protein adducts formed in cell culture medium revealed that the highly drug-specific T-cell responses were likely driven by the markedly different haptenic structures formed by these two drugs. In this study the unique haptenic structures on albumin in patients formed by amoxicillin and clavulanic acid have been characterized and shown to function as chemically distinct antigens which can stimulate separate, specific T-cell clones.",nonCancer
817,Trastuzumab-resistant cells rely on a HER2-PI3K-FoxO-survivin axis and are sensitive to PI3K inhibitors.,"The antibody trastuzumab is approved for treatment of patients with HER2 (ERBB2)-overexpressing breast cancer. A significant fraction of these tumors are either intrinsically resistant or acquire resistance rendering the drug ineffective. The development of resistance has been attributed to failure of the antibody to inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is activated by the HER2 network. Herein, we examined the effects of PI3K blockade in trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer cell lines. Treatment with the pan-PI3K inhibitor XL147 and trastuzumab reduced proliferation and pAKT levels, triggering apoptosis of trastuzumab-resistant cells. Compared with XL147 alone, the combination exhibited a superior antitumor effect against trastuzumab-resistant tumor xenografts. Furthermore, treatment with XL147 and trastuzumab reduced the cancer stem-cell (CSC) fraction within trastuzumab-resistant cells both in vitro and in vivo. These effects were associated with FoxO-mediated inhibition of transcription of the antiapoptosis gene survivin (BIRC5) and the CSC-associated cytokine interleukin-8. RNA interference-mediated or pharmacologic inhibition of survivin restored sensitivity to trastuzumab in resistant cells. In a cohort of patients with HER2-overexpressing breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, higher pretreatment tumor levels of survivin RNA correlated with poor response to therapy. Together, our results suggest that survivin blockade is required for therapeutic responses to trastuzumab and that by combining trastuzumab and PI3K inhibitors, CSCs can be reduced within HER2(+) tumors, potentially preventing acquired resistance to anti-HER2 therapy.",cancer

1045,Clinical phenotype of germline RUNX1 haploinsufficiency: from point mutations to large genomic deletions.,"Germline RUNX1 mutations result in a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by qualitative and quantitative platelet defects and predisposition to the development of myeloid malignancies (familial platelet disorder with propensity to acute myeloid leukaemia, FPD/AML). Only 13 pedigrees have previously been described so far. We report on two novel germline RUNX1 mutations: (1) an out-of-frame 8 bp heterozygous deletion (c.442_449del) in an FPD/AML pedigree and (2) a de novo 3.5 Mb deletion in the 21q22.11.21q22.12 region encompassing the RUNX1 gene in a mentally retarded female patient with short stature and thrombocytopenia. Interestingly, a similar de novo submicroscopic deletion has been recently reported in the literature in a mentally retarded patient. Mental retardation is one of the most common disorders and primary causes of thrombocytopenia are rare. When occurring together, these features should prompt to test for 21q22 deletion for comprehensive genetic counselling and clinical management.",cancer
1015,Fusion events lead to truncation of FOS in epithelioid hemangioma of bone.,"Epithelioid hemangioma of bone is a locally aggressive vascular neoplasm. It can be challenging to diagnose because of the wide histological spectrum, which can make it difficult to differentiate from other vascular neoplasms such as epithelioid hemangioendothelioma or epithelioid angiosarcoma. COBRA-FISH karyotyping identified a balanced t(3;14) translocation. Transcriptome sequencing of the index case and two other epithelioid hemangiomas revealed a recurrent translocation breakpoint involving the FOS gene, which was fused to different partners in all three cases. The break was observed in exon 4 of the FOS gene and the fusion event led to the introduction of a stop codon. In all instances, the truncation of the FOS gene would result in the loss of the transactivation domain (TAD). Using FISH probes we found a break in the FOS gene in two additional cases, in none of these cases a recurrent fusion partner could be identified. In total, FOS was split in 5/7 evaluable samples. We did not observe point mutations leading to early stop codons in any of the 10 cases where RNA was available. Detection of FOS rearrangement may be a useful diagnostic tool to assist in the often difficult differential diagnosis of vascular tumors of bone. Our data suggest that the translocation causes truncation of the FOS protein, with loss of the TAD, which is thereby a novel mechanism involved in tumorigenesis.",cancer
997,Phase II study of the antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab-DM1 for the treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer after prior HER2-directed therapy.,"The antibody-drug conjugate trastuzumab-DM1 (T-DM1) combines the biologic activity of trastuzumab with targeted delivery of a potent antimicrotubule agent, DM1, to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing cancer cells. Based on results from a phase I study that showed T-DM1 was well tolerated at the maximum-tolerated dose of 3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, with evidence of efficacy, in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) who were previously treated with trastuzumab, we conducted a phase II study to further define the safety and efficacy of T-DM1 in this patient population. This report describes a single-arm phase II study (TDM4258g) that assessed efficacy and safety of intravenous T-DM1 (3.6 mg/kg every 3 weeks) in patients with HER2-positive MBC who had tumor progression after prior treatment with HER2-directed therapy and who had received prior chemotherapy. With a follow-up of ≥ 12 months among 112 treated patients, the objective response rate by independent assessment was 25.9% (95% CI, 18.4% to 34.4%). Median duration of response was not reached as a result of insufficient events (lower limit of 95% CI, 6.2 months), and median progression-free survival time was 4.6 months (95% CI, 3.9 to 8.6 months). The response rates were higher among patients with confirmed HER2-positive tumors (immunohistochemistry 3+ or fluorescent in situ hybridization positive) by retrospective central testing (n = 74). Higher response rates were also observed in patients whose tumors expressed ≥ median HER2 levels by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for HER2 expression, compared with patients who had less than median HER2 levels. T-DM1 was well tolerated with no dose-limiting cardiotoxicity. Most adverse events (AEs) were grade 1 or 2; the most frequent grade ≥ 3 AEs were hypokalemia (8.9%), thrombocytopenia (8.0%), and fatigue (4.5%). T-DM1 has robust single-agent activity in patients with heavily pretreated, HER2-positive MBC and is well tolerated at the recommended phase II dose.",cancer

789,Phase II Pilot Study of Vemurafenib in Patients With Metastatic BRAF-Mutated Colorectal Cancer.,"BRAF V600E mutation is seen in 5% to 8% of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) and is associated with poor prognosis. Vemurafenib, an oral BRAF V600 inhibitor, has pronounced activity in patients with metastatic melanoma, but its activity in patients with BRAF V600E-positive metastatic CRC was unknown. In this multi-institutional, open-label study, patients with metastatic CRC with BRAF V600 mutations were recruited to an expansion cohort at the previously determined maximum-tolerated dose of 960 mg orally twice a day. Twenty-one patients were enrolled, of whom 20 had received at least one prior metastatic chemotherapy regimen. Grade 3 toxicities included keratoacanthomas, rash, fatigue, and arthralgia. Of the 21 patients treated, one patient had a confirmed partial response (5%; 95% CI, 1% to 24%) and seven other patients had stable disease by RECIST criteria. Median progression-free survival was 2.1 months. Patterns of concurrent mutations, microsatellite instability status, CpG island methylation status, PTEN loss, EGFR expression, and copy number alterations were not associated with clinical benefit. In contrast to prior expectations, concurrent KRAS and NRAS mutations were detected at low allele frequency in a subset of the patients' tumors (median, 0.21% allele frequency) and were apparent mechanisms of acquired resistance in vemurafenib-sensitive patient-derived xenograft models. In marked contrast to the results seen in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma, single-agent vemurafenib did not show meaningful clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E mutant CRC. Combination strategies are now under development and may be informed by the presence of intratumor heterogeneity of KRAS and NRAS mutations.",cancer
979,NF2 Loss Promotes Oncogenic RAS-Induced Thyroid Cancers via YAP-Dependent Transactivation of RAS Proteins and Sensitizes Them to MEK Inhibition.,"Ch22q LOH is preferentially associated with RAS mutations in papillary and in poorly differentiated thyroid cancer (PDTC). The 22q tumor suppressor NF2, encoding merlin, is implicated in this interaction because of its frequent loss of function in human thyroid cancer cell lines. Nf2 deletion or Hras mutation is insufficient for transformation, whereas their combined disruption leads to murine PDTC with increased MAPK signaling. Merlin loss induces RAS signaling in part through inactivation of Hippo, which activates a YAP-TEAD transcriptional program. We find that the three RAS genes are themselves YAP-TEAD1 transcriptional targets, providing a novel mechanism of promotion of RAS-induced tumorigenesis. Moreover, pharmacologic disruption of YAP-TEAD with verteporfin blocks RAS transcription and signaling and inhibits cell growth. The increased MAPK output generated by NF2 loss in RAS-mutant cancers may inform therapeutic strategies, as it generates greater dependency on the MAPK pathway for viability. Intensification of mutant RAS signaling through copy-number imbalances is commonly associated with transformation. We show that NF2/merlin inactivation augments mutant RAS signaling by promoting YAP/TEAD-driven transcription of oncogenic and wild-type RAS, resulting in greater MAPK output and increased sensitivity to MEK inhibitors.",cancer

The samples were assessed for the frequency of parasites.|The frequency of Entamoeba gingivalis was reduced in saliva (p= 0.007) and plaque (p= 0.027) three weeks after the treatment. Likewise, the frequency of Trichomonas tenax reduced in saliva (p= 0.030); however, the decrease was not significant in plaque (p= 0.913). Trichomonas tenax frequency in dental plaque directly related to the severity of periodontitis (r= 0.565, p≤ 0.000). In contrast, the number of Entamoeba gingivalis in both saliva (r= -0.405, p≤ 0.005) and plaque (r= -0.304, p= 0.040) was inversely related with the severity of the periodontal disease.|Nonsurgical periodontal treatment could reduce the number of Trichomonas Tenax and Entamoeba gingivalis in the oral environment of patients with chronic periodontitis.",nonCancer

Surgical specimens of BTC were transplanted directly into immunodeficient mice to establish xenografts, then subjected to in vitro cell culture. The gemcitabine sensitivity of each cell line was determined and compared with the genome-wide gene expression profile. A new predictive biomarker candidate was validated using an additional cohort of gemcitabine-treated BTC cases. From 55 BTC cases, we established 19 xenografts and six new cell lines. Based on their gemcitabine sensitivity, 10 BTC cell lines (including six new and four publicly available ones) were clearly categorized into two groups, and MAGEH1 mRNA expression in the tumor cells showed a significant negative correlation with their sensitivity to gemcitabine. Immunohistochemically, MAGEH1 protein was detected in three (50%) out of six sensitive cell lines, and four (100%) out of four resistant cell lines. In the validation cohort of gemcitabine-treated recurrence cases, patients were categorized into ""effective"" and ""non-effective"" groups according to the RECIST guidelines for assessment of chemotherapeutic effects. MAGEH1 protein expression was detected in two (40%) out of five ""effective"" cases and all four (100%) ""non-effective"" cases. We have established a new BTC bioresource that covers a wide range of biological features, including drug sensitivity, and is linked with clinical information. Negative expression of MAGEH1 protein serves as a potential predictive marker for the effectiveness of gemcitabine therapy in BTC.",cancer
320,Impact of human papilloma virus infection on the response of head and neck cancers to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibody therapy.,"Infection with human papillomaviruses (HPVs) characterizes a distinct subset of head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs). HPV-positive HNSCC preferentially affect the oropharynx and tonsils. Localized HPV-positive HNSCCs have a favorable prognosis and treatment outcome. However, the impact of HPV in advanced or metastatic HNSCC remains to be defined. In particular, it is unclear whether HPV modulates the response to cetuximab, an antibody targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is a mainstay of treatment of advanced HNSCC. To this end, we have examined the sensitivity of HPV-positive and -negative HNSCC models to cetuximab and cytotoxic drugs in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we have stably expressed the HPV oncogenes E6 and E7 in cetuximab-sensitive cancer cell lines to specifically investigate their role in the antibody response. The endogenous HPV status or the expression of HPV oncogenes had no significant impact on cetuximab-mediated suppression of EGFR signaling and proliferation in vitro. Cetuximab effectively inhibited the growth of E6- and E7-expressing tumors grafted in NOD/SCID mice. In support, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from cetuximab-treated patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC were probed for p16(INK4a) expression, an established biomarker of HPV infection. Response rates (45.5% versus 45.5%) and median progression-free survival (97 versus 92 days) following cetuximab-based therapy were similar in patients with p16(INK4A)-positive and p16(INK4A)-negative tumors. In conclusion, HPV oncogenes do not modulate the anti-EGFR antibody response in HSNCC. Cetuximab treatment should be administered independently of HPV status.",cancer
2421,"Induction of cell proliferation, clonogenicity and cell accumulation in S phase as a consequence of human UBE2Q1 overexpression.","Ubiquitination is an important cellular mechanism with a pivotal role in the degradation of abnormal or short-lived proteins and the regulation of cell cycle and cell growth. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is altered in multiple types of human malignancies, including colorectal cancer (CRC). The alteration in the expression of the novel human gene ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 Q1 (UBE2Q1), as a putative member of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family, has been reported in several malignancies, including carcinoma of the breast, hepatocellular and colorectal cancer, and pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In the present study, the effect of UBE2Q1 overexpression on cell growth, clonogenicity, motility and cell cycle was investigated in a CRC cell line. The UBE2Q1 gene was cloned in the pCMV6-AN-GFP expression vector. A series of stable transfectants of SW1116 cells overexpressing UBE2Q1 protein were established and confirmed by fluorescence microscopy and western blotting. Using these cells, MTT assay was performed to evaluate cell growth and proliferation, while crystal violet staining was used for clonogenicity assay. Cell cycle analysis was also performed to survey the ratio of cells accumulated in different phases of the cell cycle upon transfection. The motility of these cells was also studied using wound healing assay. UBE2Q1 transfectants exhibited a faster growth in cell culture, increased colony formation capacity and enhanced motility compared with control non-transfected cells and cells transfected with empty vector (mock-transfected cells). UBE2Q1 overexpression also resulted in a significant decrease in the number of cells accumulated in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. The present findings suggest that UBE2Q1 may function as an oncogene that induces proliferation of cancer cells, and could be a novel diagnostic tool and a potential therapeutic target for CRC.",nonCancer

1921,Endothelin-1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in human chondrosarcoma cells by repressing miR-300.,"Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin predominantly composed of cartilage-producing cells. This type of bone cancer is extremely resistant to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Surgical resection is the primary treatment, but is often difficult and not always practical for metastatic disease, so more effective treatments are needed. In particular, it would be helpful to identify molecular markers as targets for therapeutic intervention. Endothelin-1 (ET-1), a potent vasoconstrictor, has been shown to enhance chondrosarcoma angiogenesis and metastasis. We report that ET-1 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human chondrosarcoma cells. EMT is a key pathological event in cancer progression, during which epithelial cells lose their junctions and apical-basal polarity and adopt an invasive phenotype. Our study verifies that ET-1 induces the EMT phenotype in chondrosarcoma cells via the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. In addition, we show that ET-1 increases EMT by repressing miR-300, which plays an important role in EMT-enhanced tumor metastasis. We also show that miR-300 directly targets Twist, which in turn results in a negative regulation of EMT. We found a highly positive correlation between ET-1 and Twist expression levels as well as tumor stage in chondrosarcoma patient specimens. Therefore, ET-1 may represent a potential novel molecular therapeutic target in chondrosarcoma metastasis.",nonCancer
1580,"Zeolite Beta Formation from Clear Sols: Silicate Speciation, Particle Formation and Crystallization Monitored by Complementary Analysis Methods.","The formation of silicate nanoaggregates (NAs) at the very early stages of precursor sols and zeolite beta crystallization from silicate nanoparticles (NPs) are investigated in detail using a combination of different analysis methods, including liquid-state (29) Si, (27) Al, (14) N, and (1) H NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry (MS), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and transmission electron microscopy at cryogenic temperatures (cryo-TEM). Prior to hydrothermal treatment, silicate NAs are observed if the Si/OH ratio in the reaction mixture is greater than 1. Condensation of oligomers within the NAs then generates NPs. Aluminum doped into the synthesis mixtures is located exclusively in the NPs, and is found exclusively in a state that is fourfold connected to silicate, favoring their condensation and aggregation. These results are in agreement with general trends observed for other systems. Silicate NAs are essential intermediates for zeolite formation and are generated by the aggregation of hydrated oligomers, aluminate, and templating cations. Subsequent further intra-nanoaggregate silicate condensation results in the formation of NPs. (1) H and (14) N liquid NMR as well as diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) experiments provide evidence for weakly restricted rotational and translational mobility of the organic template within NAs as a consequence of specific silicate-template interactions. NAs thus appear as key species in clear sols, and their presence in the precursor sol favors silicate condensation and further crystallization, promoted either by increasing the Si/OH ratio or by heating.",nonCancer
1147,Phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha and KRAS mutations are important predictors of resistance to therapy with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Specific mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are predictive for favorable response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and are associated with a good prognosis. In contrast, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutation has been shown to predict poor response to such therapy. Nevertheless, tumor that initially responds to EGFR-TKIs almost inevitably becomes resistant later. Other mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors could involve activating mutations of the other main EGFR effector pathway, i.e., the phosphoinositide-3-kinase/phosphate and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN)/alpha serine/threonine protein kinase (AKT) pathway. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of phosphoinositide-3-kinase catalytic alpha (PIK3CA), EGFR, and KRAS gene mutations in predicting response and survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR-TKIs. A total of 166 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKI with available archival tissue specimens were included. PIK3CA, EGFR, and KRAS mutations were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction-based sequencing. EGFR mutation was detected in 25.3% of patients, PIK3CA mutation in 4.1%, and KRAS mutation in 6.7%. PIK3CA mutation correlated with shorter median time to progression (TTP) (p = 0.01) and worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.001). EGFR mutation (p < 0.0001) correlated with favorable response to TKIs treatment and longer TTP (p < 0.0001). KRAS mutation correlated with progressive disease (p = 0.05) and shorter median TTP (p = 0.003) but not with OS. Cox multivariate analysis including histology and performance status showed that PIK3CA mutation was an independent factor to predict worse OS (p = 0.0001) and shorter TTP (p = 0.03), while KRAS mutation to predict shorter TTP (p = 0.01). PIK3CA and KRAS mutations seem to be indicators of resistance and poor survival in patients with NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs.",cancer

O-atoms with two distinct incident translational energies were scattered from the surface of [C12mim][BF4]. Angle-dependent time-of-flight distributions and OH yields, respectively, were recorded from high and low-energy O atoms. There were no significant changes in the measurements using either approach, nor the properties derived from them, accompanying the transition from the SmA to the isotropic phase. This indicates that the surface structure of [C12mim][BF4] remains essentially unchanged across the phase boundary, implying that the bulk order and surface structure are not strongly correlated for this material. This effect is ascribed to the strong propensity for the outer surfaces of ionic liquids to be dominated by alkyl chains, over an underlying layer rich in anions and cation head groups, whether or not the bulk material is a liquid crystal. In a comparative study, the OH yield from the surface of the liquid crystal, 8CB, was found to be affected by the bulk order, showing a surprising step increase at the SmA-nematic transition temperature, whose origin is the subject of speculation.",nonCancer

381,Colon cancer-derived oncogenic EGFR G724S mutant identified by whole genome sequence analysis is dependent on asymmetric dimerization and sensitive to cetuximab.,"Inhibition of the activated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with either enzymatic kinase inhibitors or anti-EGFR antibodies such as cetuximab, is an effective modality of treatment for multiple human cancers. Enzymatic EGFR inhibitors are effective for lung adenocarcinomas with somatic kinase domain EGFR mutations while, paradoxically, anti-EGFR antibodies are more effective in colon and head and neck cancers where EGFR mutations occur less frequently. In colorectal cancer, anti-EGFR antibodies are routinely used as second-line therapy of KRAS wild-type tumors. However, detailed mechanisms and genomic predictors for pharmacological response to these antibodies in colon cancer remain unclear. We describe a case of colorectal adenocarcinoma, which was found to harbor a kinase domain mutation, G724S, in EGFR through whole genome sequencing. We show that G724S mutant EGFR is oncogenic and that it differs from classic lung cancer derived EGFR mutants in that it is cetuximab responsive in vitro, yet relatively insensitive to small molecule kinase inhibitors. Through biochemical and cellular pharmacologic studies, we have determined that cells harboring the colon cancer-derived G719S and G724S mutants are responsive to cetuximab therapy in vitro and found that the requirement for asymmetric dimerization of these mutant EGFR to promote cellular transformation may explain their greater inhibition by cetuximab than small-molecule kinase inhibitors. The colon-cancer derived G719S and G724S mutants are oncogenic and sensitive in vitro to cetuximab. These data suggest that patients with these mutations may benefit from the use of anti-EGFR antibodies as part of the first-line therapy.",cancer
2197,Transcriptional activity of human endogenous retrovirus in Albanian children with autism spectrum disorders.,"Recent studies suggest that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) result from interactions between genetic and environmental factors, whose possible links could be represented by epigenetic mechanisms. Here, we investigated the transcriptional activity of three human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) families, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from Albanian ASD children, by quantitative real-time PCR. We aimed to confirm the different expression profile already found in Italian ASD children, and to highlight any social and family health condition emerging from information gathered through a questionnaire, to be included among environmental risk factors. The presence of increased HERV-H transcriptional activity in all autistic patients could be understood as a constant epigenetic imprinting of the disease, potentially useful for early diagnosis and for the development of effective novel therapeutic strategies.",nonCancer
809,Phase II randomized study of trastuzumab emtansine versus trastuzumab plus docetaxel in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1), an antibody-drug conjugate composed of the cytotoxic agent DM1 conjugated to trastuzumab via a stable thioether linker, has shown clinical activity in single-arm studies enrolling patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) whose disease had progressed on HER2-targeted therapy in the metastatic setting. Patients (N = 137) with HER2-positive MBC or recurrent locally advanced breast cancer were randomly assigned to trastuzumab plus docetaxel (HT; n = 70) or T-DM1 (n = 67) as first-line treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Primary end points were investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and safety. Key secondary end points included overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), duration of objective response, clinical benefit rate, and quality of life. Median PFS was 9.2 months with HT and 14.2 months with T-DM1 (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.97); median follow-up was approximately 14 months in both arms. ORR was 58.0% (95% CI, 45.5% to 69.2%) with HT and 64.2% (95% CI, 51.8% to 74.8%) with T-DM1. T-DM1 had a favorable safety profile versus HT, with fewer grade ≥ 3 adverse events (AEs; 46.4% v 90.9%), AEs leading to treatment discontinuations (7.2% v 34.8%), [corrected] and serious AEs (20.3% v 25.8%). Preliminary OS results were similar between treatment arms; median follow-up was approximately 23 months in both arms. In this randomized phase II study, first-line treatment with T-DM1 for patients with HER2-positive MBC provided a significant improvement in PFS, with a favorable safety profile, versus HT.",cancer
2392,Risk Factors and Plasma Glucose Profile of Gestational Diabetes in Omani Women.,"We sought to conduct a detailed study on the risk factors of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Omani women to determine the actual and applicable risk factors and glucose profile in this population.|We conducted a cross-sectional case-control study using pregnant women diagnosed with GDM. Pregnant women without GDM were used as a control group. We collected information related to age, family history, prior history of pregnancy complications, age of marriage, age of first pregnancy, fasting glucose level, and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results from three hospitals in Oman through face-to-face interviews and hospital records.|The median age of women with GDM was 33 years old (p < 0.050). A significant risk was noted in women with a history of diabetes (p < 0.001), and those with mothers' with a history of GDM. A significant (p < 0.010) relationship with a likelihood ratio of 43.9 was observed between the incidence of GDM in women with five or six pregnancies, a history of > 3 deliveries, height < 155 cm, and pregnancy or marriage at age < 18 years (p < 0.010). The mean difference in random plasma glucose, one-hour OGTT, and two-hour OGTT was significantly higher in GDM cases compared to control.|Glucose profile, family history, anthropometric profile, and age of first pregnancy and marriage should be considered while screening for GDM and determining the care needs of Omani women with GDM.",nonCancer
131,"Single-agent CEP-701, a novel FLT3 inhibitor, shows biologic and clinical activity in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia.","Activating mutations of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) are present in approximately 30% of patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with lower cure rates from standard chemotherapy-based treatment. Targeting the mutation by inhibiting the tyrosine kinase activity of FLT3 is cytotoxic to cell lines and primary AML cells harboring FLT3 mutations. Successful FLT3 inhibition can also improve survival in mouse models of FLT3-activated leukemia. CEP-701 is an orally available, novel, receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that selectively inhibits FLT3 autophosphorylation. We undertook a phase 1/2 trial to determine the in vivo hematologic effects of single-agent CEP-701 as salvage treatment for patients with refractory, relapsed, or poor-risk AML expressing FLT3-activating mutations. Fourteen heavily pretreated AML patients were treated with CEP-701 at an initial dose of 60 mg orally twice daily. CEP-701-related toxicities were minimal. Five patients had clinical evidence of biologic activity and measurable clinical response, including significant reductions in bone marrow and peripheral blood blasts. Laboratory data confirmed that clinical responses correlated with sustained FLT3 inhibition to CEP-701. Our results show that FLT3 inhibition is associated with clinical activity in AML patients harboring FLT3-activating mutations and indicate that CEP-701 holds promise as a novel, molecularly targeted therapy for this disease.",cancer
2020,MiR-19b suppresses PTPRG to promote breast tumorigenesis.,"Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G (PTPRG) is an important tumor suppressor gene in multiple human cancers. In this study, we found that PTPRG protein levels were downregulated in breast cancer tissues while the mRNA levels varied irregularly, implying a post-transcriptional mechanism was involved. Because microRNAs are powerful post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression, we used bioinformatics analysis to search for microRNAs that potentially targets PTPRG in the setting of breast cancer. We identified two specific binding sites for miR-19b in the 3'-untranslated region of PTPRG. We further identified an inverse correlation between miR-19b and PTPRG protein levels, but not mRNA levels, in human breast cancer tissues. By overexpressing or knocking down miR-19b in MCF-7 cells and MDA-231 cells, we experimentally confirmed that miR-19b directly suppresses PTPRG expression. Furthermore, we determined that the inhibition of PTPRG by miR-19b leads to increased proliferation, stimulated cell migration and reduced apoptosis. Taken together, our findings provide the first evidence that miR-19b inhibits PTPRG expression to promote tumorigenesis in human breast cancer.",nonCancer

416,Heme oxygenase-1 is a predictive biomarker for therapeutic targeting of advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma treated with sorafenib or sunitinib.,"We analyzed the expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in patients undergoing radical nephrectomy for advanced clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CC-RCC) and evaluated the effects of the targeted therapies treated with sorafenib and sunitinib. Expression of HO-1 in cancer tissue from 66 patients was measured by immunohis-tochemical staining. The patients received either oral sorafenib (n=40) or oral sunitinib (n=26) within 4 weeks after nephrectomy and were followed up long term to determine the tumor response and prognosis. Our current study revealed a high HO-1 expression level in 57.6% (38/66) of patients and a low HO-1 expression level in 42.4% (28/66) of patients with CC-RCC. The study also revealed that patients with high HO-1 expression did not have a higher objective response rate (2.6% versus 53.6%, P<0.01), clinical benefit rate (47.4% versus 92.9%, P<0.01), longer progression-free survival (4.4 versus 42 months, P=0.022), or overall survival (χ (2)=4.775, P=0.029) than patients with low HO-1 expression. In the low HO-1 level group, a higher tumor response rate and a longer survival time was achieved in patients who received sorafenib or sunitinib. Multivariate analysis showed that HO-1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for tumor response and overall survival. High expression of HO-1 was associated with a lower tumor response rate and a shorter overall survival time when compared with low expression of HO-1. Overall, HO-1 expression might be a useful biomarker for predicting the response to sunitinib and sorafenib for patients with metastatic CC-RCC.",cancer
777,A functional genetic approach identifies the PI3K pathway as a major determinant of trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer.,"A large-scale RNA interference screen to discover genes involved in trastuzumab resistance in breast cancer identified only PTEN as a modulator of drug sensitivity. Oncogenic mutants of PIK3CA (activator of the same pathway and frequently mutated in breast cancer) also conferred resistance to trastuzumab in cell culture. In a cohort of 55 breast cancer patients, activation of the PI3K pathway, as judged by the presence of oncogenic PIK3CA mutations or low PTEN expression, was associated with poor prognosis after trastuzumab therapy, and the combined analysis of PTEN and PIK3CA identified twice as many patients at increased risk for progression compared to PTEN alone. Thus, assessment of PI3K pathway activation may provide a biomarker to identify patients unlikely to respond to trastuzumab-based therapy.",cancer
27,Crenolanib inhibits the drug-resistant PDGFRA D842V mutation associated with imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,"To determine the potential of crenolanib, a potent inhibitor of PDGFRA, to treat malignancies driven by mutant PDGFRA. The biochemical activity of crenolanib was compared with imatinib using a panel of PDGFRA-mutant kinases expressed in several different cell line models, including primary gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) cells. The antiproliferative activity of crenolanib was also studied in several cell lines with PDGFRA-dependent growth. Crenolanib was significantly more potent than imatinib in inhibiting the kinase activity of imatinib-resistant PDGFRA kinases (D842I, D842V, D842Y, DI842-843IM, and deletion I843). For example, crenolanib was 135-fold more potent than imatinib against D842V in our isogenic model system, with an IC(50) of approximately 10 nmol/L. The relative potency of crenolanib was further confirmed in BaF3 and primary GIST cells expressing PDGFRA D842V. In contrast, imatinib was at least 10-fold more potent than crenolanib in inhibiting the V561D mutation. For all other tested PDGFRA mutations, crenolanib and imatinib had comparable potency. Crenolanib is a potent inhibitor of imatinib-resistant PDGFRA kinases associated with GIST, including the PDGFRA D842V mutation found in approximately 5% of GISTs. The spectrum of activity of crenolanib suggests that this drug is a type I inhibitor (inhibitor of activated conformation of kinase). Based in part on these results, a phase II clinical study of this agent to treat GIST with the PDGFRA D842V mutation has been initiated.",cancer
900,Suppression of Peutz-Jeghers polyposis by targeting mammalian target of rapamycin signaling.,"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a unique disorder characterized by the development of hamartomas in the gastrointestinal tract as well as increased risks for variety of malignancies. Germ-line mutations of LKB1 cause PJS. We have generated Lkb1+/- mice, which model human PJS. Rapamycin and its analogues are promising preventive and therapeutic agents that specifically inhibit signaling from mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Hyperactivation of mTOR signaling has been associated with PJS. The objective of the study is to investigate the efficacy of mTOR inhibition in suppressing Peutz-Jeghers polyposis in Lkb1+/- mice. We initiated a trial of rapamycin in Lkb1+/- mice at 9 months of age (after the onset of polyposis) at the dose of 2 mg/kg/d for a 2-month period. We assessed the efficacy of rapamycin by measuring polyp sizes and tumor burden. To examine the effect of rapamycin on mTOR signaling, phosphorylation levels of S6 were evaluated by immunostaining. We observed a significant decrease in mean tumor burden (Student's t test, P = 0.023) as well as total tumor burden in rapamycin-treated group compared with control group. Comparison of the polyp size observed in both rapamycin-treated and control groups showed that rapamycin efficiently decreased the tumor burden of large polyps (> 8 mm). This inhibition of rapamycin was associated with a decrease in phosphorylated S6 levels in the polyps. Rapamycin effectively suppresses Peutz-Jeghers polyposis in a mouse model, suggesting that rapamycin or its analogues may represent a new targeted therapy for the treatment of PJS.",cancer
1011,Cytogenetic findings in liposarcoma correlate with histopathologic subtypes.,"The cytogenetic findings in 31 liposarcomas from 26 patients are reported. Four other tumors did not grow. Three histologic types are represented in this analysis. The well-differentiated liposarcomas were characterized by telomeric associations, large marker chromosomes and ring chromosomes, and in some cases, double minutes. The pleomorphic liposarcomas contained very high clonal chromosomal numbers with near-tetraploid modes and numerous variable, often unidentifiable, chromosomal abnormalities. The myxoid liposarcomas were characterized primarily by a t(12;16)(q13;p11) as the sole abnormality or additional changes. These results indicate that cytogenetic findings may provide a new criterion, not only for establishing the diagnosis of liposarcoma, but also for differentiating confusing histologic types of liposarcoma and these lesions from other types of sarcomas.",cancer
2043,Spindle Size Scaling Contributes to Robust Silencing of Mitotic Spindle Assembly Checkpoint.,"Chromosome segregation during mitosis hinges on proper assembly of the microtubule spindle that establishes bipolar attachment to each chromosome. Experiments demonstrate allometry of mitotic spindles and a universal scaling relationship between spindle size and cell size across metazoans, which indicates a conserved principle of spindle assembly at play during evolution. However, the nature of this principle is currently unknown. Researchers have focused on deriving the mechanistic underpinning of the size scaling from the mechanical aspects of the spindle assembly process. In this work we take a different standpoint and ask: What is the size scaling for? We address this question from the functional perspectives of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). SAC is the critical surveillance mechanism that prevents premature chromosome segregation in the presence of unattached or misattached chromosomes. The SAC signal gets silenced after and only after the last chromosome-spindle attachment in mitosis. We previously established a model that explains the robustness of SAC silencing based on spindle-mediated spatiotemporal regulation of SAC proteins. Here, we refine the previous model, and find that robust and timely SAC silencing entails proper size scaling of mitotic spindle. This finding provides, to our knowledge, a novel, function-oriented angle toward understanding the observed spindle allometry, and the universal scaling relationship between spindle size and cell size in metazoans. In a broad sense, the functional requirement of robust SAC silencing could have helped shape the spindle assembly mechanism in evolution.",nonCancer
288,"A KRAS variant is a biomarker of poor outcome, platinum chemotherapy resistance and a potential target for therapy in ovarian cancer.","Germline variants in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of cancer genes disrupting microRNA (miRNA) regulation have recently been associated with cancer risk. A variant in the 3'UTR of the KRAS oncogene, referred to as the KRAS variant, is associated with both cancer risk and altered tumor biology. Here, we test the hypothesis that the KRAS variant can act as a biomarker of outcome in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), and investigate the cause of altered outcome in KRAS variant-positive EOC patients. As this variant seems to be associated with tumor biology, we additionally test the hypothesis that this variant can be directly targeted to impact cell survival. EOC patients with complete clinical data were genotyped for the KRAS variant and analyzed for outcome (n=536), response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (n=125) and platinum resistance (n=306). Outcome was separately analyzed for women with known BRCA mutations (n=79). Gene expression was analyzed on a subset of tumors with available tissue. Cell lines were used to confirm altered sensitivity to chemotherapy associated with the KRAS variant. Finally, the KRAS variant was directly targeted through small-interfering RNA/miRNA oligonucleotides in cell lines and survival was measured. Postmenopausal EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to die of ovarian cancer by multivariate analysis (hazard ratio=1.67, 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.57, P=0.019, n=279). Perhaps explaining this finding, EOC patients with the KRAS variant were significantly more likely to be platinum resistant (odds ratio=3.18, confidence interval: 1.31-7.72, P=0.0106, n=291). In addition, direct targeting of the KRAS variant led to a significant reduction in EOC cell growth and survival in vitro. These findings confirm the importance of the KRAS variant in EOC, and indicate that the KRAS variant is a biomarker of poor outcome in EOC likely due to platinum resistance. In addition, this study supports the hypothesis that these tumors have continued dependence on such 3'UTR lesions, and that direct targeting may be a viable future treatment approach.",cancer
1266,Identifying the determinants of response to MDM2 inhibition.,"Previous reports have provided evidence that p53 mutation is a strong negative predictor of response to MDM2 inhibitors. However, this correlation is not absolute, as many p53Mutant cell lines have been reported to respond to MDM2 inhibition, while many p53WT cell lines have been shown not to respond. To better understand the nature of these exceptions, we screened a panel of 260 cell lines and noted similar discrepancies. However, upon extensive curation of this panel, these apparent exceptions could be eliminated, revealing a perfect correlation between p53 mutational status and MDM2 inhibitor responsiveness. It has been suggested that the MDM2-amplified subset of p53WT tumors might be particularly sensitive to MDM2 inhibition. To facilitate clinical testing of this hypothesis, we identified a rationally derived copy number cutoff for assignment of functionally relevant MDM2 amplification. Applying this cutoff resulted in a pan-cancer MDM2 amplification rate far lower than previously published.",cancer
314,Evaluation of EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab in combination with chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: EXTREME study.,"The phase III EXTREME study demonstrated that combining cetuximab with platinum/5-fluorouracil (5-FU) significantly improved overall survival in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN) compared with platinum/5-FU alone. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate elevated tumor EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker in EXTREME study patients. Dual-color FISH was used to determine absolute and relative EGFR copy number. Models of differing stringencies were used to score and investigate whether increased copy number was predictive for the activity of cetuximab plus platinum/5-FU. Tumors from 312 of 442 patients (71%) were evaluable by FISH and met the criteria for statistical analysis. A moderate increase in EGFR copy number was common, with high-level amplification of the gene occurring in a small fraction of tumors (∼11%). Considering each of the models tested, no association of EGFR copy number with overall survival, progression-free survival or best overall response was found for patients treated with cetuximab plus platinum/5-FU. Tumor EGFR copy number is not a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of cetuximab plus platinum/5-FU as first-line therapy for patients with R/M SCCHN.",cancer
276,Therapeutic targeting of cancers with loss of PTEN function.,"Phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) is one of the most frequently disrupted tumor suppressors in cancer. The lipid phosphatase activity of PTEN antagonizes the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway to repress tumor cell growth and survival. In the nucleus, PTEN promotes chromosome stability and DNA repair. Consequently, loss of PTEN function increases genomic instability. PTEN deficiency is caused by inherited germline mutations, somatic mutations, epigenetic and transcriptional silencing, post-translational modifications, and protein-protein interactions. Given the high frequency of PTEN deficiency across cancer subtypes, therapeutic approaches that exploit PTEN loss-of-function could provide effective treatment strategies. Herein, we discuss therapeutic strategies aimed at cancers with loss of PTEN function, and the challenges involved in treating patients afflicted with such cancers. We review preclinical and clinical findings, and highlight novel strategies under development to target PTENdeficient cancers.",cancer
2232,Schizophrenia patient-derived olfactory neurosphere-derived cells do not respond to extracellular reelin.,"Reelin expression is reduced in various regions in the post-mortem brain of schizophrenia patients but the exact role of reelin function in the neurobiology of schizophrenia remains elusive. Absence of reelin in knockout mouse causes inverted lamination of the neocortex due to aberrant neuronal migration. The aim of this study was to utilize patient-derived olfactory neurosphere-derived (ONS) cells to investigate whether extracellular reelin alters cell motility in schizophrenia patient-derived cells. ONS cells from nine patients were compared with cells from nine matched healthy controls. Automated high-throughput imaging and analysis were used to track motility of individual living cells on reelin-coated surfaces produced from reelin secreted into the medium by HEK293FT cells transfected with the full-length reelin plasmid pCrl. Automated assays were used to quantify intracellular cytoskeleton composition, cell morphology, and focal adhesions. Expression of reelin and components of the reelin signaling pathway were measured by western blot and flow cytometry. Reelin inhibited the motility of control cells but not patient cells, and increased the number and size of focal adhesions in control cells but not patient cells. Patient and control cells expressed similar levels of the reelin receptors and the reelin signaling protein, Dab1, but patient cells expressed less reelin. Patient cells were smaller than control cells and had less actin and acetylated α-tubulin, components of the cytoskeleton. These findings are the first direct evidence that cellular responses to reelin are impaired in schizophrenia and are consistent with the role of reelin in cytoarchitectural deficits observed in schizophrenia patient brains.",nonCancer

Here, I briefly introduce the properties and attributes of the sea urchin system that make it an attractive platform for the study of centrosome and centriole duplication. These attributes apply to all echinoderms readily available from commercial suppliers: sea urchins, sand dollars, and starfish. I list some of the practical aspects of the system that make it a cost- and time-effective system for experimental work and then list properties that are a ""tool kit"" that can be used to conduct studies that would not be practical, or in some cases not possible, with mammalian somatic cells. Since centrioles organize and localize the pericentriolar material that nucleates the astral arrays of microtubules (Bobinnec et al. in J Cell Biol 143(6):1575-1589, 1998), the pattern of aster duplication over several cell cycles can be used as a reliable measure for centriole duplication (Sluder and Rieder in J Cell Biol 100(3):887-896, 1985).

547,Targeting the mTOR Complex by Everolimus in NRAS Mutant Neuroblastoma.,"High-risk neuroblastoma remains lethal in about 50% of patients despite multimodal treatment. Recent attempts to identify molecular targets for specific therapies have shown that Neuroblastoma RAS (NRAS) is significantly mutated in a small number of patients. However, few inhibitors for the potential treatment for NRAS mutant neuroblastoma have been investigated so far. In this in-vitro study, we show that MEK inhibitors AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901 block cell growth in NRAS mutant neuroblastoma cell lines but not in NRAS wild-type cell lines. Several studies show that mutant NRAS leads to PI3K pathway activation and combined inhibitors of PI3K/mTOR effectively block cell growth. However, we observed the combination of MEK inhibitors with PI3K or AKT inhibitors did not show synergestic effects on cell growth. Thus, we tested single mTOR inhibitors Everolimus and AZD8055. Interestingly, Everolimus and AZD8055 alone were sufficient to block cell growth in NRAS mutant cell lines but not in wild-type cell lines. We found that Everolimus alone induced apoptosis in NRAS mutant neuroblastoma. Furthermore, the combination of mTOR and MEK inhibitors resulted in synergistic growth inhibition. Taken together, our results show that NRAS mutant neuroblastoma can be targeted by clinically available Everolimus alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors which could impact future clinical studies.",cancer
2293,Population genetic structure between Yap and Palau for the coral Acropora hyacinthus.,"Information on connectivity is becoming increasingly in demand as marine protected areas are being designed as an integral part of a network to protect marine resources at the ecosystem level. Larval dispersal and population structure, however, remain very difficult to assess. Here, we tested the predictions of a detailed oceanographic connectivity model of larval dispersal and coral recruitment within Palau and between Palau and Yap, which was developed to support the review of the existing network of marine protected areas in Palau. We used high throughput microsatellite genotyping of the coral Acropora hyacinthus to characterize population genetic structure. Pairwise F' ST values between Palau and Yap (0.10), Palau and Ngulu (0.09) and Yap and Ngulu (0.09) were all significant and similar to pairwise F' ST values of sites within Palau (0.02-0.12) and within Yap (0.02-0.09) highlighting structure at island scale and indicating that recruitment may be even more localized than previously anticipated. A bottleneck test did not reveal any signs of a founder effect between Yap and Palau. Overall, the data supports the idea that recovery of A. hyacinthus in Palau did not come exclusively from a single source but most likely came from a combination of areas, including sites within Palau. In light of these results there seems to be very little connectivity around the barrier reef and management recommendation would be to increase the number or the size of MPAs within Palau.",nonCancer
1937,Characterization of reactions between water soluble trialkylphosphines and thiol alkylating reagents: Implications for protein conjugation reactions.,"Water soluble trialkylphosphines such as tris(carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) and trishydroxypropyl phosphine (THPP) are effective agents for reducing disulfide bonds in proteins and are increasingly becoming the reagents of choice for bioconjugation strategies which modify cysteine (thiol containing) amino acids. These reducing agents are often considered as being chemically compatible with thiol-alkylating groups such as maleimides and, as such, are often not removed prior to performing protein conjugation reactions. Here we demonstrate the rapid and irreversible reaction of both TCEP and THPP with derivatives of the commonly employed thiol alkylating groups, maleimide and vinyl sulphone. Mechanistic investigations revealed distinct differences between the reactions of TCEP and THPP with maleimide, leading to the production of either non-productive ylenes or succidimidyl derivatives, respectively. Importantly, we also demonstrate the incorporation of non-productive ylenes formed between maleimide and TCEP into the Pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide Pn6b following strategies employed towards the production of conjugate vaccines.",nonCancer

704,Ceritinib in ALK-rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) rearrangement is sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, but resistance invariably develops. Ceritinib (LDK378) is a new ALK inhibitor that has shown greater antitumor potency than crizotinib in preclinical studies. In this phase 1 study, we administered oral ceritinib in doses of 50 to 750 mg once daily to patients with advanced cancers harboring genetic alterations in ALK. In an expansion phase of the study, patients received the maximum tolerated dose. Patients were assessed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetic properties, and antitumor activity of ceritinib. Tumor biopsies were performed before ceritinib treatment to identify resistance mutations in ALK in a group of patients with NSCLC who had had disease progression during treatment with crizotinib. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase. The maximum tolerated dose of ceritinib was 750 mg once daily; dose-limiting toxic events included diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, elevated aminotransferase levels, and hypophosphatemia. This phase was followed by an expansion phase, in which an additional 71 patients were treated, for a total of 130 patients overall. Among 114 patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the overall response rate was 58% (95% confidence interval [CI], 48 to 67). Among 80 patients who had received crizotinib previously, the response rate was 56% (95% CI, 45 to 67). Responses were observed in patients with various resistance mutations in ALK and in patients without detectable mutations. Among patients with NSCLC who received at least 400 mg of ceritinib per day, the median progression-free survival was 7.0 months (95% CI, 5.6 to 9.5). Ceritinib was highly active in patients with advanced, ALK-rearranged NSCLC, including those who had had disease progression during crizotinib treatment, regardless of the presence of resistance mutations in ALK.

2164,Specific inhibition of p110α subunit of PI3K: putative therapeutic strategy for KRAS mutant colorectal cancers.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. It is often associated with activating mutations in KRAS leading to deregulation of major signaling pathways as the RAS-RAF-MAPK and PI3K-Akt. However, the therapeutic options for CRC patients harboring somatic KRAS mutations are still very limited. It is therefore urgent to unravel novel therapeutic approaches for those patients. In this study, we have awarded PI3K p110α a key role in CRC cells harboring KRAS/PIK3CA mutations or KRAS mutations alone. Specific silencing of PI3K p110α by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced viability and induced apoptosis or cell cycle arrest. In agreement with these cellular effects, PI3K p110α silencing led to alterations in the expression levels of proteins implicated in apoptosis and cell cycle, namely XIAP and pBad in KRAS/PIK3CA mutant cells and cyclin D1 in KRAS mutant cells. To further validate our data, a specific PI3K p110α inhibitor, BYL719, was evaluated. BYL719 mimicked the in vitro siRNA effects on cellular viability and on the alterations of apoptotic- and cell cycle-related proteins in CRC mutant cells. Overall, this study demonstrates that specific inhibition of PI3K p110α could provide an alternative therapeutic approach for CRC patients, particularly those harboring KRAS mutations.",nonCancer
876,Cetuximab for the treatment of colorectal cancer.,"Cetuximab, an IgG1 chimeric monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has activity against colorectal cancers that express EGFR. From December 2003 to August 2005, 572 patients who had colorectal cancer expressing immunohistochemically detectable EGFR and who had been previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin or had contraindications to treatment with these drugs underwent randomization to an initial dose of 400 mg of cetuximab per square meter of body-surface area followed by a weekly infusion of 250 mg per square meter plus best supportive care (287 patients) or best supportive care alone (285 patients). The primary end point was overall survival. In comparison with best supportive care alone, cetuximab treatment was associated with a significant improvement in overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.92; P=0.005) and in progression-free survival (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.80; P<0.001). These benefits were robust after adjustment in a multivariable Cox proportional-hazards model. The median overall survival was 6.1 months in the cetuximab group and 4.6 months in the group assigned to supportive care alone. Partial responses occurred in 23 patients (8.0%) in the cetuximab group but in none in the group assigned to supportive care alone (P<0.001); the disease was stable in an additional 31.4% of patients assigned to cetuximab and in 10.9% of patients assigned to supportive care alone (P<0.001). Quality of life was better preserved in the cetuximab group, with less deterioration in physical function and global health status scores (both P<0.05). Cetuximab treatment was associated with a characteristic rash; a rash of grade 2 or higher was strongly associated with improved survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.50; P<0.001). The incidence of any adverse event of grade 3 or higher was 78.5% in the cetuximab group and 59.1% in the group assigned to supportive care alone (P<0.001). Cetuximab improves overall survival and progression-free survival and preserves quality-of-life measures in patients with colorectal cancer in whom other treatments have failed.

1493,Behavioral Variation in Gorillas: Evidence of Potential Cultural Traits.,"The question of whether any species except humans exhibits culture has generated much debate, partially due to the difficulty of providing conclusive evidence from observational studies in the wild. A starting point for demonstrating the existence of culture that has been used for many species including chimpanzees and orangutans is to show that there is geographic variation in the occurrence of particular behavioral traits inferred to be a result of social learning and not ecological or genetic influences. Gorillas live in a wide variety of habitats across Africa and they exhibit flexibility in diet, behavior, and social structure. Here we apply the 'method of exclusion' to look for the presence/absence of behaviors that could be considered potential cultural traits in well-habituated groups from five study sites of the two species of gorillas. Of the 41 behaviors considered, 23 met the criteria of potential cultural traits, of which one was foraging related, nine were environment related, seven involved social interactions, five were gestures, and one was communication related. There was a strong positive correlation between behavioral dissimilarity and geographic distance among gorilla study sites. Roughly half of all variation in potential cultural traits was intraspecific differences (i.e. variability among sites within a species) and the other 50% of potential cultural traits were differences between western and eastern gorillas. Further research is needed to investigate if the occurrence of these traits is influenced by social learning. These findings emphasize the importance of investigating cultural traits in African apes and other species to shed light on the origin of human culture.",nonCancer
936,Specific EGFR mutations predict treatment outcome of stage IIIB/IV patients with chemotherapy-naive non-small-cell lung cancer receiving first-line gefitinib monotherapy.,"To explore predictive factors for time to treatment failure (TTF) in chemotherapy-naive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving gefitinib treatment. We designed a phase II study to test gefitinib antitumor efficacy in advanced-stage, chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients. Patients were treated with gefitinib 250 mg/d. Tumor assessments were performed every 2 months. Responding or stable patients were treated until progression or unacceptable toxicity. All scans were reviewed independently. EGFR exons 18-21 sequence, K-ras exon 2 sequence, and MET gene copy numbers were examined in available samples. Clinical or molecular predictors of TTF were examined by multivariate analysis. One hundred six patients were enrolled. Ninety patients had tumor samples for biomarker tests. Overall response rate was 50.9% (95% CI, 41.4% to 60.4%). Median TTF was 5.5 months, and median overall survival (OS) was 22.4 months. The response rate and median TTF of the patients with exon 19 deletion (n = 20) were 95.0% and 8.9 months, for exon 21 L858R mutation (n = 23) were 73.9% and 9.1 month, and for other types of EGFR mutations (N = 12) were 16.7% and 2.3 months, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the presence of EGFR deletion exon 19 or L858R EGFR mutations in adenocarcinoma patients predicted longer TTF. High copy number of MET seemed to correlate with shorter TTF in patients with gefitinib-sensitive activating EGFR mutations. In this prospective study, EGFR exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations in adenocarcinoma were the best predictors for longer TTF in stage IIIB/IV chemotherapy-naive NSCLC patients receiving first-line gefitinib monotherapy.",cancer

Epidermoid cysts of the floor of the mouth represent <0.01% of all oral cysts. So far, only a few cases have been reported.|Hereby, we present a case of a giant sublingual epidermoid cyst, which was completely asymptomatic upon presentation. However, due to its large size, it pushed the epiglottis posteriorly and created difficulty during intubation. The patient developed respiratory distress after its surgical excision and extubation, requiring tracheostomy post operatively. The patient recovered well and a successful weaning of tracheostomy was performed, giving the patient a healthy life.|Epidermoid cyst is a rare differential diagnosis of sublingual swelling that should be kept in mind for large asymptomatic swellings in this region.

602,All trans retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"All trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is able to induce complete remission (CR) in almost all patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) through in vivo differentiation of APL blasts. However, it cannot eliminate the leukemic clone and to be effective must be used in combination with anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Experience accumulated over the last 10 years has clearly shown that the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy gives better survival in newly diagnosed APL than chemotherapy alone because of fewer relapses and a higher CR rate experienced by these patients. It is also strongly suggested that maintenance treatment with ATRA, and possibly in combination with low-dose chemotherapy, can further reduce the incidence of relapse. Overall, more than 90% of patients with newly diagnosed APL can achieve CR and about 75% can be cured by the combination of ATRA and chemotherapy.",cancer
2406,Donor age and C1orf132/MIR29B2C determine age-related methylation signature of blood after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.,"Our recent study demonstrated that DNA methylation status in a set of CpGs located in ELOVL2, C1orf132, TRIM59, KLF14, and FHL2 can accurately predict calendar age in blood. In the present work, we used these markers to evaluate the effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) on the age-related methylation signature of human blood.|DNA methylation in 32 CpGs was investigated in 16 donor-recipient pairs using pyrosequencing. DNA was isolated from the whole blood collected from recipients 27-360 days (mean 126) after HSCT and from the donors shortly before the HSCT.|It was found that in the recipients, the predicted age did not correlate with their calendar age but was correlated with the calendar age (r = 0.94, p = 4 × 10(-8)) and predicted age (r = 0.97, p = 5 × 10(-10)) of a respective donor. Despite this strong correlation, the predicted age of a recipient was consistently lower than the predicted age of a donor by 3.7 years (p = 7.8 × 10(-4)). This shift was caused by hypermethylation of the C1orf132 CpGs, for C1orf132 CpG_1. Intriguingly, the recipient-donor methylation difference correlated with calendar age of the donor (r = 0.76, p = 6 × 10(-4)). This finding could not trivially be explained by shifts of the major cellular factions of blood.|We confirm the single previous report that after HSCT, the age of the donor is the major determinant of age-specific methylation signature in recipient's blood. A novel finding is the unique methylation dynamics of C1orf132 which encodes MIR29B2C implicated in the self-renewing of hematopoietic stem cells. This observation suggests that C1orf132 could influence graft function after HSCT.",nonCancer
172,Alterations of the Notch pathway in lung cancer.,"Notch signaling regulates cell specification and homeostasis of stem cell compartments, and it is counteracted by the cell fate determinant Numb. Both Numb and Notch have been implicated in human tumors. Here, we show that Notch signaling is altered in approximately one third of non-small-cell lung carcinomas (NSCLCs), which are the leading cause of cancer-related deaths: in approximately 30% of NSCLCs, loss of Numb expression leads to increased Notch activity, while in a smaller fraction of cases (around 10%), gain-of-function mutations of the NOTCH-1 gene are present. Activation of Notch correlates with poor clinical outcomes in NSCLC patients without TP53 mutations. Finally, primary epithelial cell cultures, derived from NSCLC harboring constitutive activation of the Notch pathway, are selectively killed by inhibitors of Notch (gamma-secretase inhibitors), showing that the proliferative advantage of these tumors is dependent upon Notch signaling. Our results show that the deregulation of the Notch pathway is a relatively frequent event in NSCLCs and suggest that it might represent a possible target for molecular therapies in these tumors.",cancer
762,The ALK inhibitor ceritinib overcomes crizotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements invariably develop resistance to the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib. Herein, we report the first preclinical evaluation of the next-generation ALK TKI, ceritinib (LDK378), in the setting of crizotinib resistance. An interrogation of in vitro and in vivo models of acquired resistance to crizotinib, including cell lines established from biopsies of patients with crizotinib-resistant NSCLC, revealed that ceritinib potently overcomes crizotinib-resistant mutations. In particular, ceritinib effectively inhibits ALK harboring L1196M, G1269A, I1171T, and S1206Y mutations, and a cocrystal structure of ceritinib bound to ALK provides structural bases for this increased potency. However, we observed that ceritinib did not overcome two crizotinib-resistant ALK mutations, G1202R and F1174C, and one of these mutations was identified in 5 of 11 biopsies from patients with acquired resistance to ceritinib. Altogether, our results demonstrate that ceritinib can overcome crizotinib resistance, consistent with clinical data showing marked efficacy of ceritinib in patients with crizotinib-resistant disease. The second-generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib can overcome several crizotinib-resistant mutations and is potent against several in vitro and in vivo laboratory models of acquired resistance to crizotinib. These findings provide the molecular basis for the marked clinical activity of ceritinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC with crizotinib-resistant disease.

1514,Comparison of chemical composition in Tuber aestivum Vittad. of different geographical origin.,"Truffles are prized and nutrition-rich edible hypogeous fungi. The aim of this study was a comprehensive investigation of chemical composition of Burgundy truffle (Tuber aestivum Vittad.). We tried to answer the question: what is the impact of the environment on the truffle quality. To know the nutritional value of Burgundy truffle we compared lipids, proteins, saccharides, polyphenolics, flavonoids, total sterols, ergosterol, volatile flavour and aroma compounds content in fruit bodies of the fungus collected in three different geographical regions, i.e. Poland, Slovakia and Italy. A comparison of the above mentioned compounds is especially interesting due to environmental and climatic differences among the studied geographical regions. Results revealed that fruit bodies of T. aestivum from Poland and Slovakia possessed nearly similar content of proteins, total sterols, and saccharides. The fruiting bodies from Italy contained significantly larger amounts of most of the investigated compounds. In turn, Polish specimens had higher content of lipids and polyphenolics than Slovak and Italian ones. We have found higher similarity of volatile compounds composition between Polish and Italian specimens than those of Polish and Slovak origin. This article is protected by copyright.

847,Correlation of mutation profile and response in patients with myelofibrosis treated with ruxolitinib.,"Although most patients with myelofibrosis (MF) derive benefit from ruxolitinib, some are refractory, have a suboptimal response, or quickly lose their response. To identify genes that may predict response to ruxolitinib, we performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) of a panel of 28 genes recurrently mutated in hematologic malignancies in a cohort of patients with MF who were treated with ruxolitinib in a phase 1/2 study. We also tested for CALR deletions by standard polymerase chain reaction methods. Ninety-eight percent of patients had a mutation in ≥1 gene. Seventy-nine (82.1%) patients had the JAK2(V617F) mutation, 9 (9.5%) had CALR mutations (7 type 1, 2 type 2), 3 (3.1%) had MPL mutations, and 4 (4.2%) were negative for all 3. ASXL1/JAK2 and TET2/JAK2 were the most frequently comutated genes. Mutations in NRAS, KRAS, PTPN11, GATA2, TP53, and RUNX1 were found in <5% of patients. Spleen response (≥50% reduction in palpable spleen size) was inversely correlated with the number of mutations; patients with ≤2 mutations had ninefold higher odds of a spleen response than those with ≥3 mutations (odds ratio = 9.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-47.2). Patients with ≥3 mutations also had a shorter time to treatment discontinuation and shorter overall survival than those with fewer mutations. In multivariable analysis, only number of mutations and spleen response remained associated with time to treatment discontinuation. Patients with ≥3 mutations had the worst outcomes, suggesting that multigene profiling may be useful for therapeutic planning for MF.",cancer

Recurrence Regions of Interest (RoIs) were positioned on the enhancing component of tumoral tissue revealed by post-contrast T1-weighted images. The rCBV measurements on the corresponding maps were made before and after the start of the anti-angiogenic therapy. The Cox proportional hazards model and the Kaplan-Meier method were used with the log-rank test to establish whether pre- and post-bevacizumab rCBV predicted progression-free survival (PFS). We tried to assess if there was a correlation between rCBV at T0 and rCBV at T1 using the Pearson's correlation coefficient.|In the univariable analysis, rCBV was significantly predictive of PFS at T0 (HR= 5.3, p=0.003) and at T1 (HR=4.14, p=0.04). Similarly, in the multivariate Cox model analysis, rCBV was predictive of PFS at T0 (HR=4.4, p=0.04) and T1 (HR=4.2, p=0.02). PFS was longer in patients whose rCBV was less than 4.50 ml/100g at T0 and less than 1.83 ml/100g at T1 than in patients with higher rCBV values. There was a moderate positive correlation between rCBV at T0 and rCBV at T1 (P=0.032, R=0.546).|Despite the limited number of enrolled patients, rCBV assessed using DSC-MRI through the parameter rCBV is proved reliable in predicting the effects of anti-angiogenic treatment in patients with recurrent GBM.",nonCancer
401,A NOTCH1 gene copy number gain is a prognostic indicator of worse survival and a predictive biomarker to a Notch1 targeting antibody in colorectal cancer.,"Dysregulation of the Notch1 receptor has been shown to facilitate the development and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC) and has been identified as an independent predictor of disease progression and worse survival. Although mutations in the NOTCH1 receptor have not been described in CRC, we have previously discovered a NOTCH1 gene copy number gain in a portion of CRC tumor samples. Here, we demonstrated that a NOTCH1 gene copy number gain is significantly associated with worse survival and a high percentage of gene duplication in a cohort of patients with advanced CRC. In our CRC patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDTX) model, tumors harboring a NOTCH1 gain exhibited significant elevation of the Notch1 receptor, JAG1 ligand and cleaved Notch1 activity. In addition, a significant association was identified between a gain in NOTCH1 gene copy number and sensitivity to a Notch1-targeting antibody. These findings suggest that patients with metastatic CRC that harbor a gain in NOTCH1 gene copy number have worse survival and that targeting this patient population with a Notch1 antibody may yield improved outcomes.",cancer
1133,"Screen for IDH1, IDH2, IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH mutations in glioblastoma.","Isocitrate dehydrogenases (IDHs) catalyse oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (α-KG). IDH1 functions in the cytosol and peroxisomes, whereas IDH2 and IDH3 are both localized in the mitochondria. Heterozygous somatic mutations in IDH1 occur at codon 132 in 70% of grade II-III gliomas and secondary glioblastomas (GBMs), and in 5% of primary GBMs. Mutations in IDH2 at codon 172 are present in grade II-III gliomas at a low frequency. IDH1 and IDH2 mutations cause both loss of normal enzyme function and gain-of-function, causing reduction of α-KG to D-2-hydroxyglutarate (D-2HG) which accumulates. Excess hydroxyglutarate (2HG) can also be caused by germline mutations in D- and L-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenases (D2HGDH and L2HGDH). If loss of IDH function is critical for tumourigenesis, we might expect some tumours to acquire somatic IDH3 mutations. Alternatively, if 2HG accumulation is critical, some tumours might acquire somatic D2HGDH or L2HGDH mutations. We therefore screened 47 glioblastoma samples looking for changes in these genes. Although IDH1 R132H was identified in 12% of samples, no mutations were identified in any of the other genes. This suggests that mutations in IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH do not occur at an appreciable frequency in GBM. One explanation is simply that mono-allelic IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur more frequently by chance than the bi-allelic mutations expected at IDH3, D2HGDH and L2HGDH. Alternatively, both loss of IDH function and 2HG accumulation might be required for tumourigenesis, and only IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have these dual effects.",cancer
1294,Characterization of Aspergillus section Nigri species populations in vineyard soil using droplet digital PCR.,"Identification of populations of Aspergillus section Nigri species in environmental samples using traditional methods is laborious and impractical for large numbers of samples. We developed species-specific primers and probes for quantitative droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) to improve sample throughput and simultaneously detect multiple species in each sample. The ddPCR method was used to distinguish A. niger, A. welwitschiae, A. tubingensis and A. carbonarius in mixed samples of total DNA. Relative abundance of each species measured by ddPCR agreed with input ratios of template DNAs. Soil samples were collected at six time points over two growing seasons from two raisin vineyards in Fresno County, California. Aspergillus section Nigri strains were detected in these soils in the range of 10(2) to 10(5) cfu per gram. Relative abundance of each species varied widely among samples, but in 52 of 60 samples, A. niger was the most abundant species, ranging from 38% to 88% of the total population. In combination with total plate counts, this ddPCR method provides a high-throughput method for describing population dynamics of important potential mycotoxin-producing species in environmental samples.

1031,Immunogenomics of Hypermutated Glioblastoma: A Patient with Germline POLE Deficiency Treated with Checkpoint Blockade Immunotherapy.,"We present the case of a patient with a left frontal glioblastoma with primitive neuroectodermal tumor features and hypermutated genotype in the setting of a POLE germline alteration. During standard-of-care chemoradiation, the patient developed a cervical spine metastasis and was subsequently treated with pembrolizumab. Shortly thereafter, the patient developed an additional metastatic spinal lesion. Using whole-exome DNA sequencing and clonal analysis, we report changes in the subclonal architecture throughout treatment. Furthermore, a persistently high neoantigen load was observed within all tumors. Interestingly, following initiation of pembrolizumab, brisk lymphocyte infiltration was observed in the subsequently resected metastatic spinal lesion and an objective radiographic response was noted in a progressive intracranial lesion, suggestive of active central nervous system (CNS) immunosurveillance following checkpoint blockade therapy. It is unclear whether hypermutated glioblastomas are susceptible to checkpoint blockade in adults. Herein, we provide proof of principle that glioblastomas with DNA-repair defects treated with checkpoint blockade may result in CNS immune activation, leading to clinically and immunologically significant responses. These patients may represent a genomically stratified group for whom immunotherapy could be considered.

The vagina, in particular, is considered to be the most commonly affected gynecological organ, with an incidence of 4% of total TCC cases. The pathogenesis of vaginal TCC is challenging to determine, although it is essential for the adequate management of the tumor and to determine the appropriate treatment. The present study reports a case of bladder TCC and metachronous vaginal TCC. The patient had a history of high risk non muscle invasive bladder cancer treated by BCG and presented with a recurrent carcinoma in situ. A novel cycle of BCG was initiated but the patient had a persistent disease and a palpable mass on bimanual examination. Radical anterior pelvectomy and bilateral pelvic and inguinal lymph node dissection was performed revealing the presence of TCC of the bladder neck and the invasion into the anterior vaginal wall. The differences between local vaginal invasion and the metastatic spread from a primary bladder TCC, the occurrence of a second primary vaginal tumor and the direct implantation of TCC via urine that contains transitional cancer cells were reviewed and analyzed. Finally, a management plan was determined.",nonCancer
752,Overexpression of pRB in human pancreatic carcinoma cells: function in chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.,"Human pancreatic adenocarcinomas are highly resistant to chemotherapy. The p16 tumor-suppressor protein is inactivated in more than 90% of human pancreatic cancers. The p16 protein transcriptionally inhibits expression of retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene pRB. The pRB protein transcriptionally inhibits expression of the p16 gene. Because pRB normally prevents apoptosis, we investigated whether pRB is involved in resistance to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. pRB expression was examined by immunohistochemistry in 106 human pancreatic tissue specimens. The human pancreatic tumor cell line Capan-1 (pRB+/p16-) was stably transfected with p16 to functionally inactivate pRB. pRB gene expression was examined by western and northern blot analyses, and pRB function was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and promoter transactivation studies for the transcription factor E2F. Changes in cell sensitivity to chemotherapy were measured by assays for cytotoxicity and apoptosis. pRB was overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas but was hardly detectable in other pancreatic malignancies, chronic pancreatitis, or nontransformed human pancreatic tissue. Expression of p16 in Capan-1 cells resulted in the loss of pRB gene and protein expression concomitant with increased activity of the transcription factor E2F, which was not detected in wild-type or control-transfected Capan-1 cells. Wild-type and control-transfected Capan-1 cells were resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, but pRB-depleted (i.e., p16-transfected) Capan-1 cells were highly sensitive. The effect was specific to pRB depletion because two other human pancreatic cancer cell lines that retained high pRB expression after p16 transfection were resistant to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of pRB is associated with human pancreatic duct-cell cancer and may allow pancreatic cancer cells to evade chemotherapy-induced apoptosis.",cancer

Treatment included intensive double-induction therapy and consolidation therapy with high cumulative doses of high-dose cytarabine. NPM1 mutations were identified in 48% of the patients including 12 novel sequence variants, all leading to a frameshift in the C-terminus of the nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) protein. Mutant NPM1 was associated with specific clinical, phenotypical, and genetic features. Statistical analysis revealed a significant interaction of NPM1 and FLT3 internal tandem duplications (ITDs). NPM1 mutations predicted for better response to induction therapy and for favorable overall survival (OS) only in the absence of FLT3 ITD. Multivariable analysis for OS revealed combined NPM1-mutated/FLT3 ITD-negative status, CEBPA mutation status, availability of a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-compatible donor, secondary AML, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) as prognostic factors. In conclusion, NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3 ITD define a distinct molecular and prognostic subclass of young-adult AML patients with normal cytogenetics.",cancer

Vulval leiomyomas are rare, and to the best of our knowledge, perineal leiomyomas in postmenopausal women have not been previously reported in the literature. The present case describes a 60-year-old Chinese woman who experienced perineal tenderness and lumbosacral radiating pain. The patient, who went through the menopause 12 years previously, had presented with a painful perineal mass for 1 year, which was subsequently diagnosed as a postmenopausal perineal leiomyoma. The mass was locally resected, and histopathological examination of the lesion resulted in a diagnosis of benign epithelioid leiomyoma. Immunohistochemical staining identified that the leiomyoma was positive for estrogen receptor and negative for progesterone receptor expression. The patient was followed up for 1 year and did not experience any pain or recurrence. The symptoms of local and lumbosacral radiating pain are extremely rare and may be induced by peripheral nerve stimulation. The etiology of postmenopausal perineal leiomyoma may be associated with infection, dietary, stress and environmental factors, and the role of estrogen cannot be overemphasized in cases of postmenopausal leiomyoma.",nonCancer
64,Differential inhibitor sensitivity of anaplastic lymphoma kinase variants found in neuroblastoma.,"Activating mutations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene were recently discovered in neuroblastoma, a cancer of the developing autonomic nervous system that is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in the first year of life. The most frequent ALK mutations in neuroblastoma cause amino acid substitutions (F1174L and R1275Q) in the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the intact ALK receptor. Identification of ALK as an oncogenic driver in neuroblastoma suggests that crizotinib (PF-02341066), a dual-specific inhibitor of the ALK and Met tyrosine kinases, will be useful in treating this malignancy. Here, we assessed the ability of crizotinib to inhibit proliferation of neuroblastoma cell lines and xenografts expressing mutated or wild-type ALK. Crizotinib inhibited proliferation of cell lines expressing either R1275Q-mutated ALK or amplified wild-type ALK. In contrast, cell lines harboring F1174L-mutated ALK were relatively resistant to crizotinib. Biochemical analyses revealed that this reduced susceptibility of F1174L-mutated ALK to crizotinib inhibition resulted from an increased adenosine triphosphate-binding affinity (as also seen in acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors). Thus, this effect should be surmountable with higher doses of crizotinib and/or with higher-affinity inhibitors.",cancer
406,Frequent promoter hypermethylation of PTPRT increases STAT3 activation and sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in head and neck cancer.,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) overactivation is a common event in many cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), where STAT3 represents a promising therapeutic target. HNSCC is not characterized by frequent kinase mutations, in contrast to some malignancies where mutational activation of kinases upstream of STAT3 is common. Instead, STAT3 may be activated by loss-of-function of negative regulators of STAT3, including by promoter hypermethylation of PTPRT. Here we first analyzed The Cancer Genome Atlas data and determined that the PTPRT promoter is frequently hypermethylated in several cancers, including HNSCC (60.1% of tumors analyzed) in association with downregulation of PTPRT mRNA expression and upregulation of pSTAT3 expression. These findings were confirmed in an independent cohort of HNSCC tumors by methylation-specific PCR and immunohistochemistry. We demonstrate that PTPRT promoter methylation and gene silencing is reversible in HNSCC cells, leading to PTPRT-specific downregulation of pSTAT3 expression. We further show that PTPRT promoter methylation is significantly associated with sensitivity to STAT3 inhibition in HNSCC cells, suggesting that PTPRT promoter methylation may serve as a predictive biomarker for responsiveness to STAT3 inhibitors in clinical development.",cancer

2375,"Expression of microphthalmia transcription factor, S100 protein, and HMB-45 in malignant melanoma and pigmented nevi.","Malignant melanoma (MM) is a type of malignant tumor, which originates from neural crest melanocytes. MM progresses rapidly and results in a high mortality rate. The present study aims to investigate the expression of microphthalmia transcription factor (MITF), the S100 protein, and HMB-45 in MM and pigmented nevi. A total of 32 MM samples (including three skin metastasis, three lymph node metastasis and two spindle cell MM samples), two Spitz nevus samples, four pigmented nevus samples and two blue nevus samples were collected. The expression levels of S100 protein, HMB-45, and MITF were observed via immunostaining. The S100 protein exhibited high positive rates in MM and pigment disorders (96.7 and 100%, respectively), but with low specificity. The S100 protein was also expressed in fibroblasts, myoepithelial cells, histocytes and Langerhans cells in normal skin samples. HMB-45 had high specificity. Its positive expression was only confined to MM cells and junctional nevus cells. Furthermore, HMB-45 was not expressed in melanocytes in the normal tissue samples around the tumor or in the benign intradermal nevus cells. MITF exhibited high specificity and high sensitivity. It was expressed in the nuclei of melanocytes, MM cells and nevus cells. It was observed to be strongly expressed in metastatic MM and spindle cell MMs. Thus, MITF may present as a specific immunomarker for the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of MM.",nonCancer
1852,The Standardized Letter of Evaluation for Postgraduate Training: A Concept Whose Time Has Come?,"A medical student's letter of recommendation for postgraduate training applications should provide a fair and accurate assessment of academic and clinical performance, as well as define character attributes pertinent to the practice of medicine. Since its inception in 1997, the emergency medicine (EM) standardized letter of evaluation (SLOE) has evolved into an instrument that provides just such an assessment. Concise, standardized, and discriminating in its assessment of performance relevant to the practice of EM, the SLOE is judged by program directors in EM as the most valuable component of a potential resident's application. Other specialties would benefit from such a specialty-specific perspective, which is currently lacking in most Electronic Residency Application Service application materials. Creation of specialty-specific SLOEs which define performance metrics or competencies and noncognitive personality traits critical to each unique specialty would add substantially to the holistic review of our graduating students. As a result, specialty-specific SLOEs would increase the likelihood that programs could effectively identify applicants who would not only be a ""good fit"" for their programs but also graduate to become successful physicians.",nonCancer
313,ATR mutation in endometrioid endometrial cancer is associated with poor clinical outcomes.,"PURPOSE Mutations in the DNA damage response gene ATR (exon 10 A10 mononucleotide repeat) have been previously described in endometrial and other cancers with defective DNA mismatch repair. In vitro studies showed that endometrial cancer cell lines with A10 repeat tract truncating mutations have a failure in the ATR-dependent DNA damage response. Cell lines carrying A10 mutations fail to trigger Chk1 activation in response to ionizing radiation and topoisomerase inhibitors. We sought to determine the frequency and clinicopathologic significance of ATR mutations in patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS The ATR exon 10 A10 repeat was analyzed by direct sequencing in 141 tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI-positive) and 107 microsatellite stable (MSI-negative) tumors. The relationships between mutations and clinicopathologic variables, including overall and disease-free survival, were assessed using contingency table tests and Cox proportional hazard models. Results ATR mutations were identified in 12 cases (4.8%; three cases with insertions and nine cases with deletions). Mutations occurred exclusively in MSI-positive tumors (P = .02), with an overall mutation rate of 8.5%. Mutation was not associated with age, race, surgical stage, International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics grade, or adjuvant treatment. Multivariate analyses revealed a significant association with reduced overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.88; 95% CI, 1.64 to 9.18; P = .002) and disease-free survival (HR = 4.29; 95% CI, 1.48 to 12.45; P = .007). CONCLUSION Truncating ATR mutations in endometrial cancers are associated with biologic aggressiveness as evidenced by reduced disease-free and overall survival. Knowledge of ATR mutation status may hold promise for individualized treatment and targeted therapies in patients with endometrial cancer.",cancer
1062,Functional assessment of variants in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes identified in individuals with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex.,"The effects of missense changes and small in-frame deletions and insertions on protein function are not easy to predict, and the identification of such variants in individuals at risk of a genetic disease can complicate genetic counselling. One option is to perform functional tests to assess whether the variants affect protein function. We have used this strategy to characterize variants identified in the TSC1 and TSC2 genes in individuals with, or suspected of having, Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC). Here we present an overview of our functional studies on 45 TSC1 and 107 TSC2 variants. Using a standardized protocol we classified 16 TSC1 variants and 70 TSC2 variants as pathogenic. In addition we identified eight putative splice site mutations (five TSC1 and three TSC2). The remaining 24 TSC1 and 34 TSC2 variants were classified as probably neutral.",cancer

1391,Activating the innate immune response to counter chronic hepatitis B virus infection.,"Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) is endemic to several populous parts of the world, where resulting complicating cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma occur commonly. Licensed drugs to treat the infection have limited curative efficacy, and development of therapies that eliminate all replication intermediates of HBV is a priority.|The recent demonstration that the activation of the innate immune response may eradicate HBV from infected hepatocytes has a promising therapeutic application. Small molecule stimulators of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) inhibit replication of woodchuck hepatitis virus in woodchucks and HBV in chimpanzees and mice. Early stage clinical trials using GS-9620, a TLR7 agonist, indicate that this candidate antiviral is well tolerated in humans. Using an alternative approach, triggering the innate immune response with agonists of lymphotoxin- receptor caused efficient APOBEC-mediated deamination and degradation of viral covalently closed circular DNA.|Eliminating HBV cccDNA from infected individuals would constitute a cure, and has become the focus of intensive research that employs various therapeutic approaches, including gene therapy. Immunomodulation through innate immune activation shows promise for the treatment of chronic infection of HBV (CHB) and, used in combination with other therapeutics, may contribute to the global control of infections and ultimately to the eradication of HBV.",nonCancer
1125,High incidence of N and K-Ras activating mutations in multiple myeloma and primary plasma cell leukemia at diagnosis.,"Using allele-specific amplification method (ARMS), a highly sensitive one-stage allele-specific PCR, we have evaluated the incidence of NRAS and KRAS2 activating mutations (codons 12, 13, and 61) in 62 patients with either monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or multiple myeloma (MM), primary plasma-cell leukemia (P-PCL), and also in human myeloma cell lines (HMCL). NRAS and/or KRAS2 mutations were found in 54.5% of MM at diagnosis (but in 81% at the time of relapse), in 50% of P-PCL, and in 50% of 16 HMCL. In contrast, the occurrence of such mutations was very low in MGUS and indolent MM (12.50%). Of note, KRAS2 mutations were always more frequent than NRAS. The validity of the technique was assessed by direct sequencing of cell lines and of some patients. Multiple mutations found in two patients were confirmed by subcloning exon PCR amplification products, testing clones with our method, and sequencing them. Thus, these early mutations could play a major role in the oncogenesis of MM and P-PCL.",cancer
310,FGFR1 amplification in lung squamous cell carcinoma: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Current targeted therapy proves no effective outcomes in lung squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC). Recent studies suggested that FGFR1 would be promising. This systematic review elaborated FGFR1 amplification in lung SQCC. An electronic search was conducted on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of SCI, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library. Eligible studies regarding incidence of FGFR1 amplification in lung SQCC and correlation between FGFR1 amplification and clinicopathological features or survival were extracted and analyzed. We identified 13 eligible studies with a total of 1798 patients. The results showed about 19% of FGFR1 amplification (95% CI: 0.15-0.24; I(2)=84.5%; p=0.000). Using the same test method: FISH, definition and ethnicity, the rates were 17% (95% CI: 0.14-0.20; I(2)=53.1%; p=0.037), 21% (95% CI: 0.18-0.24; I(2)=0; p=0.615), and 16% (95% CI: 0.13-0.19; I(2)=72.1%; p=0.028), respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis suggested that smoking status was highly correlated with FGFR1 amplification (coefficient=0.961, p<0.001). FGFR1 amplification was significantly correlated with lymph node metastasis (OR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.62-3.20; p=0.000), but not correlated with gender (OR: 1.12; 95% CI: 0.90-1.38; p=0.91), differentiation (OR: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.76-1.38; p=0.959) and stage (OR: 0.93; 95% CI: 0.73-1.19; p=0.877) in lung SQCC patients. With respect to survival, FGFR1 amplification had no influence on PFS (HR: 1.57; 95% CI: 0.85-2.30; p=0.259) and OS (HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 0.90-1.89; p=0.416) for SQCC patients. FGFR1 amplification is about 19%. Gender, stage, differentiation, ethnicities and test methods have no influence on FGFR1 amplification. FGFR1 amplification trends to correlate with lymph node metastasis and smoking. Whether FGFR1 amplification has effect on survival remains controversial.",cancer
663,CDK1 Is a Synthetic Lethal Target for KRAS Mutant Tumours.,"Activating KRAS mutations are found in approximately 20% of human cancers but no RAS-directed therapies are currently available. Here we describe a novel, robust, KRAS synthetic lethal interaction with the cyclin dependent kinase, CDK1. This was discovered using parallel siRNA screens in KRAS mutant and wild type colorectal isogenic tumour cells and subsequently validated in a genetically diverse panel of 26 colorectal and pancreatic tumour cell models. This established that the KRAS/CDK1 synthetic lethality applies in tumour cells with either amino acid position 12 (p.G12V, pG12D, p.G12S) or amino acid position 13 (p.G13D) KRAS mutations and can also be replicated in vivo in a xenograft model using a small molecule CDK1 inhibitor. Mechanistically, CDK1 inhibition caused a reduction in the S-phase fraction of KRAS mutant cells, an effect also characterised by modulation of Rb, a master control of the G1/S checkpoint. Taken together, these observations suggest that the KRAS/CDK1 interaction is a robust synthetic lethal effect worthy of further investigation.",cancer
1920,IL-24 modulates the high mobility group (HMG) A1/miR222 /AKT signaling in lung cancer cells.,"Interleukin (IL)-24, a novel tumor suppressor/cytokine exhibits antitumor activity against a broad-spectrum of human cancer cells. In a recent study, we showed that IL-24 inhibited AKT in lung cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanism of AKT inhibition by IL-24 remains elusive.The high mobility group (HMG) A1 a member of the non-histone chromosomal proteins and commonly referred to as architectural transcription factor, regulates transcription of various genes involved in cell growth and survival. Overexpression of HMGA1 has been shown to be associated with tumor progression and metastasis in several cancers, including human lung cancer. A recent study demonstrated that HMGA1 activates AKT function by reducing the activity of the protein phosphatase, phosphatase 2A subunit B (PPP2R2A) via the oncogenic micro (mi) RNA-222. Based on this report we hypothesized that IL-24-mediated AKT inhibition involved the HMGA1/miR-222 axis.To test our hypothesis, in the present study we used a H1299 lung cancer cell line that expressed exogenous human IL-24 when induced with doxycycline (DOX). Induction of IL-24 expression in the tumor cells markedly reduced HMGA1 mRNA and protein levels. Using a mechanistic approach, we found that IL-24 reduced miR-222-3p and -5p levels, as determined by qRT-PCR. Associated with HMGA1 and miR-222 inhibition was a marked increase in PPP2R2A, with a concomitant decrease in phosphorylated AKTT308/S473 expression. SiRNA-mediated knockdown of HMGA1 in combination with IL-24 significantly reduced AKT T308/S473 protein expression and greatly reduced cell migration and invasion compared with individual treatments. Further combination of IL-24 and a miR-222-3p inhibitor significantly increased PPP2R2A expression.Our results demonstrate for the first time that IL-24 inhibits AKT via regulating the HMGA1/miR-222 signaling node in human lung cancer cells and acts as an effective tumor suppressor. Thus, a therapy combining IL-24 with HMGA1 siRNA or miR-222-3p inhibitor should present effective treatment of lung cancer.",nonCancer

The patients were evaluated clinically both preoperatively and at 12 months after surgery using the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society Ankle-Hindfoot Scale (AOFAS) and a visual analog scale (VAS). For morphological evaluation, the magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue (MOCART) score was used.|the AOFAS score improved from 51.4±11.6 preoperatively to 71.8±20.6 postoperatively, while the VAS value decreased from 6.9±1.8 to 3.2±1.9. The mean MOCART score was 51.7±16.6 at 12 months of follow-up; these scores did not directly correlate with the clinical results.|use of the ACIC technique for arthroscopic repair of OLTs allowed satisfactory clinical results to be obtained in most of the patients as soon as one year after surgery, with no major complications or delayed revision surgery.

2051,The Charge Properties of Phospholipid Nanodiscs.,"Phospholipids (PLs) are a major, diverse constituent of cell membranes. PL diversity arises from the nature of the fatty acid chains, as well as the headgroup structure. The headgroup charge is thought to contribute to both the strength and specificity of protein-membrane interactions. Because it has been difficult to measure membrane charge, ascertaining the role charge plays in these interactions has been challenging. Presented here are charge measurements on lipid Nanodiscs at 20°C in 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, at pH 7.4. Values are also reported for measurements made in the presence of Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) as a function of NaCl concentration, pH, and temperature, and in solvents containing other types of cations and anions. Measurements were made for neutral (phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine) and anionic (phosphatidylserine, phosphatidic acid, cardiolipin, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)) PLs containing palmitoyl-oleoyl and dimyristoyl fatty acid chains. In addition, charge measurements were made on Nanodiscs containing an Escherichia coli lipid extract. The data collected reveal that 1) POPE is anionic and not neutral at pH 7.4; 2) high-anionic-content Nanodiscs exhibit polyelectrolyte behavior; 3) 3 mM Ca(2+) neutralizes a constant fraction of the charge, but not a constant amount of charge, for POPS and POPC Nanodiscs; 4) in contrast to some previous work, POPC only interacts weakly with Ca(2+); 5) divalent cations interact with lipids in a lipid- and ion-specific manner for POPA and PIP2 lipids; and 6) the monovalent anion type has little influence on the lipid charge. These results should help eliminate inconsistencies among data obtained using different techniques, membrane systems, and experimental conditions, and they provide foundational data for developing an accurate view of membranes and membrane-protein interactions.",nonCancer
38,AZD1480 blocks growth and tumorigenesis of RET- activated thyroid cancer cell lines.,"Persistent RET activation is a frequent event in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). In these cancers, RET activates the ERK/MAPK, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the JAK/STAT3 pathways. Here, we tested the efficacy of a JAK1/2- inhibitor, AZD1480, in the in vitro and in vivo growth of thyroid cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic RET. Thyroid cancer cell lines harboring RET/PTC1 (TPC-1), RET M918T (MZ-CRC1) and RET C634W (TT) alterations, as well as TPC-1 xenografts, were treated with JAK inhibitor, AZD1480. This inhibitor led to growth inhibition and/or apoptosis of the thyroid cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as to tumor regression of TPC-1 xenografts, where it efficiently blocked STAT3 activation in tumor and stromal cells. This inhibition was associated with decreased proliferation, decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased necrosis. However, AZD1480 repressed the growth of STAT3- deficient TPC-1 cells in vitro and in vivo, demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of STAT3 in the tumor cells. In all cell lines, the JAK inhibitor reduced phospho-Y1062 RET levels, and mTOR effector phospho-S6, while JAK1/2 downregulation by siRNA did not affect cell growth nor RET and S6 activation. In conclusion, AZD1480 effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated RET- thyroid cancer cell lines, likely through direct RET inhibition in cancer cells as well as by modulation of the microenvironment (e.g. via JAK/phospho-STAT3 inhibition in endothelial cells). Thus, AZD1480 should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of RET- activated thyroid cancers.",cancer
720,Rapid and dramatic response to alectinib in an anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearranged non-small-cell lung cancer patient who is critically ill.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have shown promising clinical activity in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that harbors ALK rearrangement. The next-generation ALK-TKI, alectinib, has been reported to have potent efficacy in ALK-positive NSCLC patients including on mutations that confer resistance to crizotinib, which was the first ALK-TKI approved for ALK-positive NSCLC. The efficacy and safety of ALK-TKIs, including crizotinib and alectinib, as the first-line treatment in critically ill patients is unclear. We report one ALK-positive NSCLC patient with poor performance status (PS) and disseminated intravascular coagulation because of respiratory failure and multiple metastases, and experienced the rapid and dramatic response to alectinib without adverse events that can lead to discontinuation and dose reduction of the drug. After a couple of months of treatment with alectinib, radiological review indicated a complete response. The present case is the first reported case of rapid and marked response to alectinib in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who had poor PS and severe organ dysfunction, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. Further investigation of the safety and efficacy of ALK-TKI for ALK-positive NSCLC patients who are critically ill is warranted.",cancer
1704,The Potential Roles of the G1LEA and G3LEA Proteins in Early Embryo Development and in Response to Low Temperature and High Salinity in Artemia sinica.,"Late embryogenesis abundant proteins (LEA) are stress resistance-related proteins that play crucial roles in protecting against desiccation, cold and high salinity in a variety of animals and plants. However, the expression pattern, distribution and functions of LEA proteins in the post-diapause period of Artemia sinica, and under high salinity and low temperature stresses, remain unknown. In this study, the complete cDNA sequences of the group 1 LEA (As-g1lea) and group 3 LEA (As-g3lea) genes from A. sinica were cloned. The expression patterns and location of As-G1LEA and As-G1LEA were investigated. The protein abundances of As-G1LEA, As-G3LEA and Trehalase were analyzed during different developmental stages of the embryo and under low temperature and high salinity stresses in A. sinica. The full-length cDNA of As-g1lea was 960 bp, encoding a 182 amino acid protein, and As-g3lea was 2089 bp, encoding a 364 amino acid protein. As-g1lea and As-g3lea showed their highest expressions at 0 h of embryonic development and both showed higher relative expression in embryonic, rather than adult, development stages. The abundances of As-G1LEA, As-G3LEA and trehalose were upregulated under low temperature and downregulated under high salinity stress. These two genes did not show any tissue or organ specific expression. Our results suggested that these LEA proteins might play a pivotal role in stress tolerance in A. sinica.",nonCancer

These findings argue that ATM deficiency may play a role during carcinogenesis. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the clinical relevance of ATM expression and ATM activation in PDAC. Both ATM expression and nuclear phosphoSer1981-ATM levels were assessed by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 133 PDAC and correlated with clinicopathological parameters. We found stratification in prognostic subgroups. Complete loss of Ser1981-ATM was indicative of the worst prognosis (median survival, 10.8 vs 14.3 months [low expression] vs 31.1 months [high expression], P < 0.001). Similarly, analysis of ATM expression demonstrated absent expression levels of ATM to be associated with dismal prognosis (median survival, 9.6 months), whereas expression of ATM in general was associated with increased survival (17.7 months, P = 0.001). Our analysis shows that both ATM expression and activated ATM are prognostic markers in PDAC with respect to standard clinicopathological parameters. These results suggest that ATM should be further explored as prognostic as well as predictive factor with respect to conventional chemotherapies and for putative synthetic lethal approaches.",cancer
230,Prognostic relevance of AIB1 (NCoA3) amplification and overexpression in breast cancer.,"AIB1 (amplified in breast cancer 1) is an estrogen receptorα (ERα) co-activator, known to be amplified and overexpressed in a fraction of breast cancers. It has been linked to prognosis and tamoxifen resistance. However, results have been ambiguous. The different functions of AIB1 in ERα-positive and -negative disease are poorly understood. Therefore, we analyzed the clinical significance of AIB1 in breast cancer with respect to ERα-status and characterized the subgroups. 2,197 breast carcinomas sampled on a pre-existing tissue microarray (TMA) were analyzed for AIB1 expression and amplification by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). AIB1 expression was detected in 60 % of the tumors. It was associated with tumor size (p = 0.003), high histological grade (p < 0.0001), poor disease-specific, and overall survival (p = 0.0018 and p = 0.003). There was a strong inverse relationship between AIB1 and ERα expression (p < 0.0001). AIB1 overexpression was associated with increased Ki67 labeling index (p < 0.0001), even if analyzed for different ER expression levels. AIB1 amplification was found in 11 % of the carcinomas. It was associated with high histological grade (p = 0.0012), lymph node involvement (p = 0.0163), and poor disease-specific survival (p = 0.0032) but not with overall survival (p = 0.1672) or ER status (p = 0.4456). If ER-positive tumors were stratified according to their AIB1 amplification status, there was a significant worse disease-specific survival in cases showing AIB1 amplification (p = 0.0017). AIB1 expression is associated with unfavorable prognosis and tumor phenotype. It seems to unfold its oncogenic potential at least in part independent from its role as an ERα co-activator. AIB1 has an impact on cell cycle regulation in ERα-positive as well as ERα-negative tumors. Furthermore, AIB1 amplification characterizes a subgroup of ERα-positive breast cancer with worse outcome. Therefore, AIB1 might be helpful to identify those ERα-positive breast cancers patients who are candidates for adjuvant chemotherapy.",cancer

We undertook a histology-independent phase 2 ""basket"" study of vemurafenib in BRAF V600 mutation-positive nonmelanoma cancers. We enrolled patients in six prespecified cancer cohorts; patients with all other tumor types were enrolled in a seventh cohort. A total of 122 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive cancer were treated, including 27 patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. The primary end point was the response rate; secondary end points included progression-free and overall survival. In the cohort with non-small-cell lung cancer, the response rate was 42% (95% confidence interval [CI], 20 to 67) and median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 3.5 to 10.8). In the cohort with Erdheim-Chester disease or Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis, the response rate was 43% (95% CI, 18 to 71); the median treatment duration was 5.9 months (range, 0.6 to 18.6), and no patients had disease progression during therapy. There were anecdotal responses among patients with pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, anaplastic thyroid cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, salivary-duct cancer, ovarian cancer, and clear-cell sarcoma and among patients with colorectal cancer who received vemurafenib and cetuximab. Safety was similar to that in prior studies of vemurafenib for melanoma. BRAF V600 appears to be a targetable oncogene in some, but not all, nonmelanoma cancers. Preliminary vemurafenib activity was observed in non-small-cell lung cancer and in Erdheim-Chester disease and Langerhans'-cell histiocytosis. The histologic context is an important determinant of response in BRAF V600-mutated cancers. (Funded by F. Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01524978.).",cancer
782,Analysis of tumor specimens at the time of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy in 155 patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancers.,"All patients with EGF receptor (EGFR)-mutant lung cancers eventually develop acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Smaller series have identified various mechanisms of resistance, but systematic evaluation of a large number of patients to definitively establish the frequency of various mechanisms has not been conducted. Patients with lung adenocarcinomas and acquired resistance to erlotinib or gefitinib enrolled onto a prospective biopsy protocol and underwent a rebiopsy after the development of acquired resistance. Histology was reviewed. Samples underwent genotyping for mutations in EGFR, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, NRAS and PIK3CA, and FISH for MET and HER2. Adequate tumor samples for molecular analysis were obtained in 155 patients. Ninety-eight had second-site EGFR T790M mutations [63%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 55%-70%] and four had small cell transformation (3%, 95% CI, 0%-6%). MET amplification was seen in 4 of 75 (5%; 95% CI, 1%-13%). HER2 amplification was seen in 3 of 24 (13%; 95% CI, 3%-32%). We did not detect any acquired mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS, MEK1, or NRAS (0 of 88, 0%; 95% CI, 0%-4%). Overlap among mechanisms of acquired resistance was seen in 4%. This is the largest series reporting mechanisms of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKI therapy. We identified EGFR T790M as the most common mechanism of acquired resistance, whereas MET amplification, HER2 amplification, and small cell histologic transformation occur less frequently. More comprehensive methods to characterize molecular alterations in this setting are needed to improve our understanding of acquired resistance to EGFR-TKIs.",cancer
306,FGFR1 amplification is associated with poor prognosis and smoking in non-small-cell lung cancer.,"FGFR1 amplification has been identified recently as an important therapeutic target in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC). However, data from previous studies on the clinical implications of FGFR amplification in NSCLC are inconsistent. We evaluated FGFR1 gene copy number (GCN) in 369 cases of surgically resected NSCLC using five previously reported criteria and investigated associations between clinicopathologic parameters and FGFR1 amplification. FGFR1 amplification was found in 32/369 (8.7 %) of NSCLC and was more frequent in SqCC (18.0 % in SqCC, 3.0 % in adenocarcinoma; p < 0.001) and in smokers (p < 0.001). On univariate analysis, FGFR1 amplification was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS, 58.6 vs 80.0 months; p = 0.033) and shorter disease-free survival (DFS, 58.5 vs 80.0 months; p = 0.042) in patients with SqCC, but this was not statistically significant on multivariate analysis (OS: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.79, 95 % confidence interval [CI] = 0.83-3.87, p = 0.139; DFS: HR = 1.73, 95 % CI = 0.93-3.21, p = 0.081). The correlation between FGFR1 amplification and protein expression was poor (rho = 0.08; p = 0.123). These results suggest that FGFR1 amplification is associated with smoking history and squamous cell carcinoma histology and might indicate poor prognosis.",cancer
1397,Cheating in OSCEs: The Impact of Simulated Security Breaches on OSCE Performance.,"Construct: Valid score interpretation is important for constructs in performance assessments such as objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs). An OSCE is a type of performance assessment in which a series of standardized patients interact with the student or candidate who is scored by either the standardized patient or a physician examiner.|In high-stakes examinations, test security is an important issue. Students accessing unauthorized test materials can create an unfair advantage and lead to examination scores that do not reflect students' true ability level. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of various simulated security breaches on OSCE scores.|Seventy-six 3rd-year medical students participated in an 8-station OSCE and were randomized to either a control group or to 1 of 2 experimental conditions simulating test security breaches: station topic (i.e., providing a list of station topics prior to the examination) or egregious security breach (i.e., providing detailed content information prior to the examination). Overall total scores were compared for the 3 groups using both a one-way between-subjects analysis of variance and a repeated measure analysis of variance to compare the checklist, rating scales, and oral question subscores across the three conditions.|Overall total scores were highest for the egregious security breach condition (81.8%), followed by the station topic condition (73.6%), and they were lowest for the control group (67.4%). This trend was also found with checklist subscores only (79.1%, 64.9%, and 60.3%, respectively for the security breach, station topic, and control conditions). Rating scale subscores were higher for both the station topic and egregious security breach conditions compared to the control group (82.6%, 83.1%, and 77.6%, respectively). Oral question subscores were significantly higher for the egregious security breach condition (88.8%) followed by the station topic condition (64.3%), and they were the lowest for the control group (48.6%).|This simulation of different OSCE security breaches demonstrated that student performance is greatly advantaged by having prior access to test materials. This has important implications for medical educators as they develop policies and procedures regarding the safeguarding and reuse of test content.",nonCancer
98,U2AF1 mutations in Chinese patients with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Somatic mutations of U2AF1 gene have recently been identified in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). In this study, we analyzed the frequency and clinical impact of U2AF1 mutations in a cohort of 452 Chinese patients with myeloid neoplasms. Mutations in U2AF1 were found in 2.5% (7/275) of AML and 6.3% (6/96) of MDS patients, but in none of 81 CML. All mutations were heterozygous missense mutations affecting codon S34 or Q157. There was no significant association of U2AF1 mutation with blood parameters, FAB subtypes, karyotypes and other gene mutations in AML. The overall survival (OS) of AML patients with U2AF1 mutation (median 3 months) was shorter than those without mutation (median 7 months) (P = 0.035). No difference in the OS was observed between MDS patients with and without U2AF1 mutations. Our data show that U2AF1 mutation is a recurrent event at a low frequency in AML and MDS.",cancer
265,IDH2R172 mutations define a unique subgroup of patients with angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.,"Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL) is a common subtype of peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) with a poor prognosis. We performed targeted resequencing on 92 cases of PTCL and identified frequent mutations affecting RHOA, TET2, DNMT3A, and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2). Although IDH2 mutations are largely confined to AITL, mutations of the other 3 can be found in other types of PTCL, although at lower frequencies. These findings indicate a key role of epigenetic regulation in the pathogenesis of AITL. However, the epigenetic alterations induced by these mutations and their role in AITL pathogenesis are still largely unknown. We correlated mutational status with gene expression and global DNA methylation changes in AITL. Strikingly, AITL cases with IDH2(R172) mutations demonstrated a distinct gene expression signature characterized by downregulation of genes associated with TH1 differentiation (eg, STAT1 and IFNG) and a striking enrichment of an interleukin 12-induced gene signature. Ectopic expression of IDH2(R172K) in the Jurkat cell line and CD4(+) T cells led to markedly increased levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate, histone-3 lysine methylation, and 5-methylcytosine and a decrease of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine. Correspondingly, clinical samples with IDH2 mutations displayed a prominent increase in H3K27me3 and DNA hypermethylation of gene promoters. Integrative analysis of gene expression and promoter methylation revealed recurrently hypermethylated genes involved in T-cell receptor signaling and T-cell differentiation that likely contribute to lymphomagenesis in AITL.",cancer
1240,O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase deficiency and response to temozolomide-based therapy in patients with neuroendocrine tumors.,"Recent studies suggest that temozolomide has activity in neuroendocrine tumors. Low levels of the DNA repair enzyme, O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), are associated with sensitivity to temozolomide in other tumor types. We evaluated the prevalence of MGMT deficiency in neuroendocrine tumors and correlated MGMT deficiency with treatment response to temozolomide-based regimens. The prevalence of MGMT deficiency, measured by immunohistochemistry, was assessed in 97 archival neuroendocrine tumor specimens. Rates of treatment response and survival were next evaluated in a cohort of 101 consecutive neuroendocrine tumor patients who had received treatment with a temozolomide-based regimen at one of three institutions. MGMT expression was directly correlated with treatment response in 21 patients who had available tumor tissue and response data. In archival specimens, MGMT deficiency was observed in 19 of 37 (51%) pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors and 0 of 60 (0%) carcinoid tumors (P < 0.0001). In the clinical cohort, 18 of 53 (34%) patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors but only 1 of 44 (2%) patients with carcinoid tumors (P < 0.001) experienced a partial or complete response to temozolomide-based therapy. Among 21 patients with evaluable tumor tissue who had also received treatment with temozolomide, 4 of 5 patients with MGMT-deficient tumors (all pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors) and 0 of 16 patients with tumors showing intact MGMT expression responded to treatment (P = 0.001). MGMT deficiency, measured by immunohistochemistry, is more common in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors than in carcinoid tumors as is treatment response to temozolomide-based therapy. Absence of MGMT may explain the sensitivity of some pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors to treatment.",cancer
1362,Molybdenum dinitrogen complexes facially coordinated by linear tridentate PEP ligands (E = N or P): impact of the central E donor in trans-position to N2.,"The syntheses of molybdenum dinitrogen complexes supported by the tridentate PEP ligands (E = N, P) prPP(Ph)P = (Ph2PCH2CH2CH2)2P(Ph), prPPHP = (Ph2PCH2CH2CH2)2PH, PN(Ph)P = (Ph2PCH2CH2)2N(Ph) and prPN(Ph)P = (Ph2PCH2CH2CH2)2N(Ph) are reported. Together with the coligand dmpm = (CH3)2PCH2P(CH3)2 dinitrogen complexes of the type [Mo(N2)(PEP)(dmpm)] are formed. The new systems are characterized by IR and NMR spectroscopy and compared with the literature-known complex [Mo(N2)(dpepp)(dmpm)] (1) (dpepp = PhP(CH2CH2PPh2)2). The consequences of the substitution of the central P-donor of dpepp by N and the replacement of its C2 by C3 linkages as well as the exchange of the EPh by an EH function are investigated with respect to the stability of the corresponding N2-complexes. Importantly, the activation of the N2 ligand drastically increases upon replacing the trans-phosphine with a trans-amine donor.",nonCancer
1561,"Does Historical Coexistence with Dingoes Explain Current Avoidance of Domestic Dogs? Island Bandicoots Are Naïve to Dogs, unlike Their Mainland Counterparts.","Introduced predators have a global reputation for causing declines and extinctions of native species. Native prey naiveté towards novel predators is thought to be a key reason for predator impacts. However, naiveté is not necessarily forever: where coexistence establishes, it is likely that naiveté will be reduced through adaptation, and the once alien predator will eventually become recognised by prey. For example, native marsupial bandicoots in Sydney avoid backyards with domestic dogs (C. lupus familiaris), but not domestic cats (Felis catus), even though cats and dogs were both introduced about 200 years ago (Carthey and Banks 2012). The authors attributed bandicoots' recognition of dogs to long-term exposure to a close relative of dogs, dingoes that arrived in Australia 4000 years ago. Here, we test a prediction of this hypothesis by taking the study to Tasmania, where dingoes have never been present but where domestic dogs also arrived about 200 years ago. We use a similar survey design to that of Carthey and Banks (2012): asking Hobart residents to report on pet-ownership, bandicoot sightings and scats within their backyards, as well as an array of yard characteristic control variables. We predicted that if long term experience with dingoes enabled mainland bandicoots to recognise domestic dogs, then Tasmanian bandicoots, which are inexperienced with dingoes, would not recognise domestic dogs. Our results indicate that Tasmanian bandicoots are naïve to both dogs and cats after only 200 years of coexistence, supporting our hypothesis and the notion that naiveté in native prey towards alien predators (as observed on the mainland) may eventually be overcome.",nonCancer
1646,Transanal endoscopic microsurgery for advanced polyps and early cancers in the rectum-Long-term outcome: A STROBE compliant observational study.,"Transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) allows for the resection of large adenomas and early stage cancers in the rectum. The rate of complications and recurrence for malignant tumors compared with benign tumors has been questioned.The objective of our study was to analyze the outcome after TEM procedures for adenomas and cancers with focus on local recurrence and complications.All 280 patients who had a TEM procedure between January 2008 and September 2015 were enrolled in a prospective cohort study. Outcome was described for benign and malignant tumors. Mortality, recurrence, and complications were recorded.Two hundred eighty tumors were treated with TEM, 176 (63%) were benign and 104 (37%) were malignant. Complication rates were significantly different in the 2 groups, 10.8% (n = 19) in the benign and 24.0% (n = 25) in the malignant group (P = 0.003). A significant difference in perforation/penetration to the peritoneal cavity was noted (P = 0.034). There were no significant difference in the recurrence rate of 8.3% (n = 13) in the benign and 9.0% (n = 7) in the malignant groups. Thirty days mortality rates were 1.1% in the benign group versus 1.9% in the malignant. Other complications were noted in 2.8% and 3.8% in the benign and malignant group, respectively.TEM seems to be a safe and viable procedure for removing both benign and malignant lesions from the rectum. TEM offers low mortality and complication rates also recurrence after resection of malignant tumors.",nonCancer
1880,Vertically aligned two-dimensional graphene-metal hydroxide hybrid arrays for Li-O2 batteries.,"Lithium oxygen batteries (LOBs) are a very promising upcoming technology which however still suffers from low lifespan and dramatic capacities fading. Solid discharge products increase the contact resistance and block the electrochemically active electrodes. The resulting high oxidative potentials and formation of Li2CO3 due to electrolyte and carbon electrode decomposition at the positive electrode lead to irreversible deactivation of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites. Here we demonstrate a facile strategy for the scalable production of a new electrode structure constituted of vertically aligned carbon nanosheets and metal hydroxide (M(OH)x@CNS) hybrid arrays, integrating both favorable ORR and OER active materials to construct a bifunctional catalysts for LOBs. Excellent lithium-oxygen battery properties with high specific capacity of 5403 mAh g-1 and 12123 mAh g-1 referenced to the carbon and M(OH)x weight, respectively, long cyclability and low charge potentials are achieved in the resulting M(OH)x@CNS cathode architecture. The properties are explained by improved O2/ion transport properties and spatially limited precipitation of Li2O2 nanoparticles inside interstitial cavities resulting in high reversibility. The strategy of creating ORR and OER bifunctional catalysts in a single conductive hybrid component may pave the way to new cathode architectures for metal air batteries.",nonCancer
915,MYD88 L265P somatic mutation in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.,"Waldenström's macroglobulinemia is an incurable, IgM-secreting lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL). The underlying mutation in this disorder has not been delineated. We performed whole-genome sequencing of bone marrow LPL cells in 30 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, with paired normal-tissue and tumor-tissue sequencing in 10 patients. Sanger sequencing was used to validate the findings in samples from an expanded cohort of patients with LPL, those with other B-cell disorders that have some of the same features as LPL, and healthy donors. Among the patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a somatic variant (T→C) in LPL cells was identified at position 38182641 at 3p22.2 in the samples from all 10 patients with paired tissue samples and in 17 of 20 samples from patients with unpaired samples. This variant predicted an amino acid change (L265P) in MYD88, a mutation that triggers IRAK-mediated NF-κB signaling. Sanger sequencing identified MYD88 L265P in tumor samples from 49 of 54 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and in 3 of 3 patients with non-IgM-secreting LPL (91% of all patients with LPL). MYD88 L265P was absent in paired normal tissue samples from patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia or non-IgM LPL and in B cells from healthy donors and was absent or rarely expressed in samples from patients with multiple myeloma, marginal-zone lymphoma, or IgM monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance. Inhibition of MYD88 signaling reduced IκBα and NF-κB p65 phosphorylation, as well as NF-κB nuclear staining, in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia cells expressing MYD88 L265P. Somatic variants in ARID1A in 5 of 30 patients (17%), leading to a premature stop or frameshift, were also identified and were associated with an increased disease burden. In addition, 2 of 3 patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had wild-type MYD88 had somatic variants in MLL2. MYD88 L265P is a commonly recurring mutation in patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia that can be useful in differentiating Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and non-IgM LPL from B-cell disorders that have some of the same features.

1566,"Association of the Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms in microRNAs 130b, 200b, and 495 with Ischemic Stroke Susceptibility and Post-Stroke Mortality.","The microRNA (miRNA) is a small non-coding RNA molecule that modulates gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. Platelets have a crucial role in both hemostasis and thrombosis, a condition that can occlude a cerebral artery and cause ischemic stroke. miR-130b, miR-200b, and miR-495 are potential genetic modulators involving platelet production and activation. We hypothesized that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these miRNAs might potentially contribute to the susceptibility to ischemic stroke and post-stroke mortality. This study included 523 ischemic stroke patients and 400 control subjects. We investigated the association of three miRNA SNPs (miR-130bT>C, miR-200bT>C, and miR-495A>C) with ischemic stroke prevalence and post-stroke mortality. In the multivariate logistic regression, there was no statistically significant difference in the distribution of miR-130bT>C, miR-200bT>C, or miR-495A>C between the ischemic stroke and control groups. In the subgroup analysis based on ischemic stroke subtype, the miR-200b CC genotype was less frequently found in the large-artery atherosclerosis stroke subtype compared with controls (TT+CT vs CC; adjusted odds ratio for CC, 0.506; 95% confidence interval, 0.265-0.965). During a mean follow-up period of 4.80 ± 2.11 years after stroke onset, there were 106 all-cause deaths among the 523 stroke patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis did not find a significant association between post-stroke mortality and three miRNA SNPs. Our findings suggest that the functional SNP of miR-200b might be responsible for the susceptibility to large-artery atherosclerotic stroke.",nonCancer

Nine patients with an advanced BCC that was previously resistant to treatment with vismodegib were given sonidegib in this investigational, open-label study. Tumor response was determined using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors. SMO mutations were identified using biopsy samples from the target BCC location. The median duration of treatment with sonidegib was 6 weeks (range, 3-58 weeks). Five patients experienced progressive disease with sonidegib. Three patients experienced stable disease and discontinued sonidegib either due to adverse events (n = 1) or due to election for surgery (n = 2). The response of one patient was not evaluable. SMO mutations with in vitro data suggesting resistance to Hh pathway inhibition were identified in 5 patients, and none of these patients experienced responses while on sonidegib. Patients with advanced BCCs that were previously resistant to treatment with vismodegib similarly demonstrated treatment resistance with sonidegib. Patients who have developed treatment resistance to an SMO inhibitor may continue to experience tumor progression in response to other SMO inhibitors.",cancer

We present a case of an exceptional responder to molecular-targeted therapy for metastatic oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma using a chemotherapeutic agent FDA approved for breast cancer and targeting the HER2/Neu receptor in order to discuss the larger clinical implications. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has recently instituted the Exceptional Responders Initiative in order to identify such patients with unexpected outcomes in order to expedite the development of additional targeted therapies. This case illustrates the opportunity for cure using targeted oncogene identification in a scenario of recurrent squamous cell carcinoma with lung metastasis typically considered fatal. Molecular tumor analysis is an infrequently utilized tool in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; however, as understanding of biologic mechanisms improves, additional molecular targets will become available and expand treatment opportunities such as HER2/Neu targeting. The Exceptional Responders Initiative is a unique strategy with potential to expedite progress.",cancer

However, little is known about the experiences of those who harm and the attitudes of the general public towards such behaviours. A deeper, richer and more organic understanding of this is vital to informing global approaches to supporting individuals through treatment and recovery.|Exploratory, qualitative design.|Three hundred and sixty two Twitter messages were subject to inductive thematic analysis.|Five themes were identified: 1) celebrity influence, 2) self-harm is not a joke (with sub-themes of you wouldn't laugh if you loved me and you think it's funny, I think it's cruel), 3) support for and from others, 4) eating disorders and self-harm and 5) videos and personal stories.|The findings indicate that self-harm behaviour continues to be largely misunderstood by the general public and is often the source of ridicule which may contribute to delays in accessing treatment. Whilst Twitter may also provide a source of valuable support for those who self-harm, the sense of community, relatedness and understanding generated by such support may contribute to normalising self-harm and perpetuating the behaviours.|Our understanding of the complexity of, aetiology and most effective treatment options for self-harm behaviours are still unclear.

1262,An Oncogenic NTRK Fusion in a Patient with Soft-Tissue Sarcoma with Response to the Tropomyosin-Related Kinase Inhibitor LOXO-101.,"Oncogenic TRK fusions induce cancer cell proliferation and engage critical cancer-related downstream signaling pathways. These TRK fusions occur rarely, but in a diverse spectrum of tumor histologies. LOXO-101 is an orally administered inhibitor of the TRK kinase and is highly selective only for the TRK family of receptors. Preclinical models of LOXO-101 using TRK-fusion-bearing human-derived cancer cell lines demonstrate inhibition of the fusion oncoprotein and cellular proliferation in vitro, and tumor growth in vivo. The tumor of a 41-year-old woman with soft-tissue sarcoma metastatic to the lung was found to harbor an LMNA-NTRK1 gene fusion encoding a functional LMNA-TRKA fusion oncoprotein as determined by an in situ proximity ligation assay. In a phase I study of LOXO-101 (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT02122913), this patient's tumors underwent rapid and substantial tumor regression, with an accompanying improvement in pulmonary dyspnea, oxygen saturation, and plasma tumor markers. TRK fusions have been deemed putative oncogenic drivers, but their clinical significance remained unclear. A patient with a metastatic soft-tissue sarcoma with an LMNA-NTRK1 fusion had rapid and substantial tumor regression with a novel, highly selective TRK inhibitor, LOXO-101, providing the first clinical evidence of benefit from inhibiting TRK fusions.",cancer
66,KRAS mutations as an independent prognostic factor in patients with advanced colorectal cancer treated with cetuximab.,"Cetuximab is efficient in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). We previously showed that KRAS mutations were associated with resistance to cetuximab in 30 CRC patients. The aim of this study was to validate, in an independent larger series of 89 patients, the prognostic value of KRAS mutations on response to cetuximab and survival. Eighty-nine metastatic CRC patients treated with cetuximab after treatment failure with irinotecan-based chemotherapy were analyzed for KRAS mutation by allelic discrimination on tumor DNA. The association between KRAS mutations and tumor response, skin toxicity, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was analyzed. A KRAS mutation was present in 27% of the patients and was associated with resistance to cetuximab (0% v 40% of responders among the 24 mutated and 65 nonmutated patients, respectively; P < .001) and a poorer survival (median PFS: 10.1 v 31.4 weeks in patients without mutation; P = .0001; median OS: 10.1 v 14.3 months in patients without mutation; P = .026). When we pooled these 89 patients with patients from our previous study, the multivariate analysis showed that KRAS status was an independent prognostic factor associated with OS and PFS, whereas skin toxicity was only associated with OS. In a combined analysis, median OS times of patients with two, one, or no favorable prognostic factors (severe skin toxicity and no KRAS mutation) was of 15.6, 10.7, and 5.6 months, respectively. These results confirm the high prognostic value of KRAS mutations on response to cetuximab and survival in metastatic CRC patients treated with cetuximab.",cancer
114,Activating HER2 mutations in HER2 gene amplification negative breast cancer.,"Data from 8 breast cancer genome-sequencing projects identified 25 patients with HER2 somatic mutations in cancers lacking HER2 gene amplification. To determine the phenotype of these mutations, we functionally characterized 13 HER2 mutations using in vitro kinase assays, protein structure analysis, cell culture, and xenograft experiments. Seven of these mutations are activating mutations, including G309A, D769H, D769Y, V777L, P780ins, V842I, and R896C. HER2 in-frame deletion 755-759, which is homologous to EGF receptor (EGFR) exon 19 in-frame deletions, had a neomorphic phenotype with increased phosphorylation of EGFR or HER3. L755S produced lapatinib resistance, but was not an activating mutation in our experimental systems. All of these mutations were sensitive to the irreversible kinase inhibitor, neratinib. These findings show that HER2 somatic mutation is an alternative mechanism to activate HER2 in breast cancer and they validate HER2 somatic mutations as drug targets for breast cancer treatment. We show that the majority of HER2 somatic mutations in breast cancer patients are activating mutations that likely drive tumorigenesis. Several patients had mutations that are resistant to the reversible HER2 inhibitor lapatinib, but are sensitive to the irreversible HER2 inhibitor, neratinib. Our results suggest that patients with HER2 mutation–positive breast cancers could benefit from existing HER2-targeted drugs.",cancer
1547,"Heated, Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannulae as a Form of Noninvasive Respiratory Support for Preterm Infants and Children with Acute Respiratory Failure.","Heated, humidified high-flow delivered by nasal cannulae (HHHFNC) is increasingly used for noninvasive respiratory support in preterm infants and critically ill children due to its perceived effectiveness and ease of use. Evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that HHHFNC and continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are equally effective as postextubation support in preterm infants. HHHFNC is also used for weaning preterm infants from CPAP. Data on HHHFNC used as the primary support for treating respiratory distress syndrome are conflicting. HHHFNC use in preterm infants is associated with reduced nasal trauma. Inability to measure the pressure generated by HHHFNC systems is a concern because overexpansion can lead to an air leak and lung injury. Great caution is warranted when HHHFNC is used in extremely low-birth-weight infants (who were rarely included in these randomized controlled trials) because a recent retrospective study found its use is associated with a higher likelihood of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or death in this population. HHHFNC has also become popular in pediatric intensive care units and pediatric wards as a method for delivering oxygen and noninvasive respiratory support. Most published studies were conducted on infants and young children with bronchiolitis. The results of a few observational studies and two randomized trials suggest that HHHFNC therapy is effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis. This review discusses the proposed mechanisms of action behind HHHFNC, the results of observational studies, and the evidence emerging from clinical trials on the use of HHHFNC in preterm infants and children critically ill with bronchiolitis.",nonCancer
57,Prognostic value of the BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of the BRAF V600E mutation in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and to determine the correlation between this mutation and indicators of poor prognosis and outcome in patients with PTC. The BRAF V600E mutation status was analyzed in 187 tumor samples using the multiplex allele-specific PCR method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to investigate the association of the BRAF V600E mutation with clinical features and patient outcome. The sensitivity of the multiplex allele-specific PCR combined with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography reached ~1%. The BRAF V600E mutation was observed in 63.6% (119/187) of tumor tissues, predominantly in PTC specimens, and no BRAF mutation was identified in other benign-type thyroid diseases. The univariate analysis indicated that the BRAF V600E mutation was associated with age, tumor stage and prognosis (P<0.05). In addition, the frequency of the BRAF V600E mutation was significantly different in the central (75.3%) and lateral neck (49.3%) lymph nodes of patients with lymph node metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the BRAF V600E mutation (HR, 2.471; 95% CI, 1.149-5.312) and lymph node metastasis (HR, 3.003; 95% CI, 1.027-8.771) are independent factors that predict tumor prognosis. Thus, the BRAF V600E mutation is an independent risk factor that may be used to predict thyroid cancer persistence/recurrence.",cancer

However, AI resistance remains a major challenge. We have demonstrated previously that increased GDNF/RET signaling in ER+ breast cancers promotes AI resistance. Here we investigated the efficacy of different small molecule RET kinase inhibitors, sunitinib, cabozantinib, NVP-BBT594 and NVP-AST487, and the potential of combining a RET inhibitor with the AI letrozole in ER+ breast cancers. The most effective inhibitor identified, NVP-AST487, suppressed GDNF-stimulated RET downstream signaling and 3D tumor spheroid growth. Ovariectomized mice were inoculated with ER+ aromatase-overexpressing MCF7-AROM1 cells and treated with letrozole, NVP-AST487 or the two drugs in combination. Surprisingly, the three treatment regimens showed similar efficacy in impairing MCF7-AROM1 tumor growth in vivo. However in vitro, NVP-AST487 was superior to letrozole in inhibiting the GDNF-induced motility and tumor spheroid growth of MCF7-AROM1 cells and required in combination with letrozole to inhibit GDNF-induced motility in BT474-AROM3 aromatase expressing cells. These data indicate that inhibiting RET is as effective as the current therapeutic regimen of AI therapy but that a combination treatment may delay cancer cell dissemination and metastasis.",nonCancer
1584,Do Adolescents With Specific Language Impairment Understand Driving Terminology?,"This study examined if adolescents with specific language impairment (SLI) understand driving vocabulary as well as their typically developing (TD) peers.|A total of 16 adolescents with SLI and 16 TD comparison adolescents completed a receptive vocabulary task focused on driving terminology derived from statewide driver's manuals.|The SLI group understood fewer driving-related terms when compared with the TD comparison group. Although both groups performed comparably in understanding simple noun driving terminology, the SLI group had greater difficulty comprehending compound noun and verb driving terms.|The decreased understanding of terms found in driver's manuals for adolescents with SLI has implications for how they access necessary information for learning the driving rules, regulations, and procedures important for securing a driver's license.",nonCancer
1499,Chlorogenic acid induces reactive oxygen species generation and inhibits the viability of human colon cancer cells.,"Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is one of the polyphenols identified in the human diet. Previous studies have shown that CGA plays a protective role against liver diseases. The colon plays a pivotal role in CGA metabolism. However, little is known about the direct effects and the underlying molecular mechanisms of CGA in colon cancer. Here, we investigate these mechanisms of CGA activity in human colon cancer cells. The effects of CGA on the viability of two human colon cancer cell lines, HCT116 and HT29, were determined using the MTT assay. The intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. In addition, changes in cell proliferation were detected by cell cycle analysis. Immunoblotting analysis was used to observe the underlying molecular changes. CGA inhibited the viability of HCT116 and HT29 cells in a dose-dependent manner. CGA induced ROS production, whereas the combined use of ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine attenuated the CGA-induced viability inhibition. Moreover, CGA induced cell cycle arrest at the S phase and suppressed the activation of extracellular signal-related kinase in both cell types, which likely contributes toward the ROS-induced viability inhibition caused by CGA treatment. CGA-induced ROS production inhibited cell viability in human colon cancer cells. CGA caused S-phase arrest and extracellular signal-related kinase inactivation that may have led to the observed viability inhibition. CGA is therefore a potential treatment against CRC.",nonCancer
1256,Novel MEK1 mutation identified by mutational analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway genes in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Genetic lesions affecting a number of kinases and other elements within the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis of human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We performed mutational profiling of a large cohort of lung adenocarcinomas to uncover other potential somatic mutations in genes of this pathway that could contribute to lung tumorigenesis. We have identified in 2 of 207 primary lung tumors a somatic activating mutation in exon 2 of MEK1 (i.e., mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 or MAP2K1) that substitutes asparagine for lysine at amino acid 57 (K57N) in the nonkinase portion of the kinase. Neither of these two tumors harbored known mutations in other genes encoding components of the EGFR signaling pathway (i.e., EGFR, HER2, KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF). Expression of mutant, but not wild-type, MEK1 leads to constitutive activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 in human 293T cells and to growth factor-independent proliferation of murine Ba/F3 cells. A selective MEK inhibitor, AZD6244, inhibits mutant-induced ERK activity in 293T cells and growth of mutant-bearing Ba/F3 cells. We also screened 85 NSCLC cell lines for MEK1 exon 2 mutations; one line (NCI-H1437) harbors a Q56P substitution, a known transformation-competent allele of MEK1 originally identified in rat fibroblasts, and is sensitive to treatment with AZD6244. MEK1 mutants have not previously been reported in lung cancer and may provide a target for effective therapy in a small subset of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.",cancer
2160,Trial of Decompressive Craniectomy for Traumatic Intracranial Hypertension.,"Background The effect of decompressive craniectomy on clinical outcomes in patients with refractory traumatic intracranial hypertension remains unclear. Methods From 2004 through 2014, we randomly assigned 408 patients, 10 to 65 years of age, with traumatic brain injury and refractory elevated intracranial pressure (>25 mm Hg) to undergo decompressive craniectomy or receive ongoing medical care. The primary outcome was the rating on the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS-E) (an 8-point scale, ranging from death to ""upper good recovery"" [no injury-related problems]) at 6 months. The primary-outcome measure was analyzed with an ordinal method based on the proportional-odds model. If the model was rejected, that would indicate a significant difference in the GOS-E distribution, and results would be reported descriptively. Results The GOS-E distribution differed between the two groups (P<0.001). The proportional-odds assumption was rejected, and therefore results are reported descriptively. At 6 months, the GOS-E distributions were as follows: death, 26.9% among 201 patients in the surgical group versus 48.9% among 188 patients in the medical group; vegetative state, 8.5% versus 2.1%; lower severe disability (dependent on others for care), 21.9% versus 14.4%; upper severe disability (independent at home), 15.4% versus 8.0%; moderate disability, 23.4% versus 19.7%; and good recovery, 4.0% versus 6.9%. At 12 months, the GOS-E distributions were as follows: death, 30.4% among 194 surgical patients versus 52.0% among 179 medical patients; vegetative state, 6.2% versus 1.7%; lower severe disability, 18.0% versus 14.0%; upper severe disability, 13.4% versus 3.9%; moderate disability, 22.2% versus 20.1%; and good recovery, 9.8% versus 8.4%. Surgical patients had fewer hours than medical patients with intracranial pressure above 25 mm Hg after randomization (median, 5.0 vs. 17.0 hours; P<0.001) but had a higher rate of adverse events (16.3% vs. 9.2%, P=0.03). Conclusions At 6 months, decompressive craniectomy in patients with traumatic brain injury and refractory intracranial hypertension resulted in lower mortality and higher rates of vegetative state, lower severe disability, and upper severe disability than medical care. The rates of moderate disability and good recovery were similar in the two groups.

1766,Significance of the Lateral Humeral Line for Evaluating Radiocapitellar Alignment in Children.,"The radiocapitellar line (RCL) was originally described for evaluation of the alignment of the RC joint on lateral images of the elbow. Although, many authors have translated the utilization of RCL into coronal imaging, previous studies have not been performed to confirm validity. The purpose of this paper was to identify an accurate way of evaluating pediatric RC alignment in the coronal plane.|Thirty-seven anteroposterior (AP) radiographs of 37 children were evaluated to determine the position of the RC joint in the coronal plane. All had acceptable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies available for comparison. The lateral humeral line (LHL), consisting of a line along the lateral edge of the ossified condyle of the distal humerus parallel to the axis of the distal humeral shaft, was studied as it related to the lateral cortex of the radial neck. Three children with a confirmed diagnosis of a Bado III, lateral displaced radius, Monteggia fracture were also evaluated.|The LHL passed along the edge of or lateral to the radial neck on all AP radiographs and all MRI studies. The RCL failed to intersect the capitellum on 2 AP radiographs. On MRI, the RCL also passed lateral to the capitellar ossification center in 3 patients. In addition, the RCL was seen passing through the capitellum at a mean of the lateral 30% (range, 0% to 64%) on AP radiographs and 26% (range, 0% to 48%) on MRI. For all 3 children with a Bado III Monteggia fracture, the LHL crossed the radial neck and the RCL did not intersect the capitellum.|The RCL can fail to intersect the capitellar ossification center on AP radiographs and MRI in pediatric elbows without injury. The LHL consistently lies lateral to the radial neck in normal elbows and medial to the lateral aspect of the radial neck on all Bado III fracture-dislocations. It, therefore, can be used as an adjunct in evaluating the RC joint on AP imaging. The RCL most commonly intersects the lateral one third of the ossification center on both plain radiographs and MRIs.|Level III-diagnostic.",nonCancer
2082,Virtual street-crossing performance in persons with multiple sclerosis: Feasibility and task performance characteristics.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disease that commonly results in physical and cognitive dysfunction. Accordingly, MS might impact the ability to safely cross the street. The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of a simulated street-crossing task in persons with MS and to determine differences in street-crossing performance between persons with MS and non-MS controls.|26 participants with MS (median Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score = 3.5) and 19 controls completed 40 trials of a virtual street-crossing task. There were 2 crossing conditions (i.e., no distraction and phone conversation), and participants performed 20 trials per condition. Participants were instructed that the goal of the task was to cross the street successfully (i.e., without being hit be a vehicle). The primary outcome was task feasibility, assessed as completion and adverse events. Secondary outcomes were measures of street-crossing performance.|Overall, the simulated street-crossing task was feasible (i.e., 90% completion, no adverse events) in participants with MS. Participants with MS waited longer and were less attentive to traffic before entering the street compared with controls (all P < .05). Participants with MS also took longer to cross the street and were closer to oncoming vehicles when exiting the street compared to controls (all P < .05). When distracted, all participants took longer to initiate crossing, took longer to cross the street, and made more head turns while crossing (all P < .05). There were no significant group by condition interaction effects (all P > .05).|A virtual street-crossing task is feasible for studying street-crossing behavior in persons with mild MS and most individuals with moderate MS. Virtual street-crossing performance is impaired in persons with MS compared to controls; however, persons with MS do not appear to be more vulnerable to a distracting condition. The virtual reality environment presents a safe and useful setting for understanding pedestrian behavior in persons with MS.",nonCancer
1694,High Prevalence and Onward Transmission of Non-Pandemic HIV-1 Subtype B Clades in Northern and Northeastern Brazilian Regions.,"The Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) epidemic in Brazil is mainly driven by the subtype B pandemic lineage (BPANDEMIC), while Caribbean non-pandemic subtype B clades (BCAR) seem to account for a very low fraction of HIV-infections in this country. The molecular characteristics of the HIV-1 subtype B strains disseminated in the Northern and Northeastern Brazilian regions, however, have not been explored so far. In this study, we estimate the prevalence of the HIV-1 BPANDEMIC and BCAR clades across different Brazilian regions and we reconstruct the spatiotemporal dynamics of dissemination of the major Brazilian BCAR clades. A total of 2,682 HIV-1 subtype B pol sequences collected from 21 different Brazilian states from the five country regions between 1998 and 2013 were analyzed. Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic analyses revealed that the BCAR strains reached 16 out 21 Brazilian states here analyzed. The BCAR clades comprise a low fraction (<10%) of subtype B infections in most Brazilian states analyzed, with exception of Roraima (41%), Amazonas (14%) and Maranhão (14%). Bayesian phylogeographic analyses indicate that BCAR strains originally from the Hispaniola and Trinidad and Tobago were introduced at multiple times into different states from all Brazilian regions and a few of those strains, probably introduced into Roraima, Maranhão and São Paulo between the late 1970s and the early 1980s, established secondary outbreaks in the Brazilian population. These results support that the HIV-1 subtype B epidemics in some Brazilian states from the Northern and Northeastern regions display a unique molecular pattern characterized by the high prevalence of BCAR lineages, which probably reflects a strong epidemiological link with the HIV-1 epidemics in the Caribbean region.",nonCancer
2271,Comparison of Radiation-Induced Bystander Effect in QU-DB Cells after Acute and Fractionated Irradiation: An In Vitro Study.,"Radiation effects induced in non-irradiated cells are termed radiation-induced bystander effects (RIBE). The present study intends to examine the RIBE response of QU-DB bystander cells to first, second and third radiation fractions and compare their cumulative outcome with an equal, single acute dose.|This experimental study irradiated three groups of target cells for one, two and three times with(60)Co gamma rays. One hour after irradiation, we transferred their culture media to non-irradiated (bystander) cells. We used the cytokinesis block micronucleus assay to evaluate RIBE response in the bystander cells. The numbers of micronuclei generated in bystander cells were determined.|RIBE response to single acute doses increased up to 4 Gy, then decreased, and finally at the 8 Gy dose disappeared. The second and third fractions induced RIBE in bystander cells, except when RIBE reached to the maximum level at the first fraction. We split the 4 Gy acute dose into two fractions, which decreased the RIBE response. However, fractionation of 6 Gy (into two fractions of 3 Gy or three fractions of 2 Gy) had no effect on RIBE response. When we split the 8 Gy acute dose into two fractions we observed RIBE, which had disappeared following the single 8 Gy dose.|The impact of dose fractionation on RIBE induced in QU-DB cells de- pended on the RIBE dose-response relationship. Where RIBE increased proportion- ally with the dose, fractionation reduced the RIBE response. In contrast, at high dos- es where RIBE decreased proportionally with the dose, fractionation either did not change RIBE (at 6 Gy) or increased it (at 8 Gy).",nonCancer

951,ERBB2 Mutations Characterize a Subgroup of Muscle-invasive Bladder Cancers with Excellent Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,"A pathologic complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) containing platinum is a strong prognostic determinant for patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). Despite comprehensive molecular characterization of bladder cancer, associations of molecular alterations with treatment response are still largely unknown. We selected pathologic complete responders (ypT0N0; n=38) and nonresponders (higher than ypT2; n=33) from a cohort of high-grade MIBC patients treated with NAC. DNA was isolated from prechemotherapy tumor tissue and used for next-generation sequencing of 178 cancer-associated genes (discovery cohort) or targeted sequencing (validation cohort). We found that 9 of 38 complete responders had erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) missense mutations, whereas none of 33 nonresponders had ERBB2 mutations (p=0.003). ERBB2 missense mutations in complete responders were mostly confirmed activating mutations. ERCC2 missense mutations, recently found associated with response to NAC, were more common in complete responders; however, this association did not reach statistical significance in our cohort. We conclude that ERBB2 missense mutations characterize a subgroup of MIBC patients with an excellent response to NAC. In this report we looked for genetic alterations that can predict the response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in bladder cancer. We found that mutations in the gene ERBB2 are exclusively present in patients responding to NAC.",cancer
588,The First-in-class Anti-EGFR Antibody Mixture Sym004 Overcomes Cetuximab Resistance Mediated by EGFR Extracellular Domain Mutations in Colorectal Cancer.,"Approved anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab provide significant clinical benefit in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC). However, patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of mutations in the extracellular domain (ECD) of EGFR. Sym004 is a novel 1:1 mixture of two nonoverlapping anti-EGFR mAbs that recently showed promising clinical activity in a phase I trial in MCRC. Our aim was to determine the efficacy of Sym004 to circumvent cetuximab resistance driven by EGFR ECD mutations. Functional studies were performed to assess drug-receptor binding as well as ligand-dependent activation of individual EGFR mutants in the presence of cetuximab, panitumumab, and Sym004. Cell viability and molecular effects of the drugs were assayed in cetuximab-resistant cell lines and in tumor xenograft models. Efficacy of Sym004 was evaluated in patients progressing to cetuximab that harbored EGFR mutation in the post-cetuximab tumor sample. Contrary to cetuximab and panitumumab, Sym004 effectively bound and abrogated ligand-induced phosphorylation of all individual EGFR mutants. Cells resistant to cetuximab harboring mutations in EGFR maintained sensitivity to Sym004, which was consistent with an effective suppression of EGFR downstream signaling, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in the xenograft model. As proof-of-principle, a patient with a tumor harboring an EGFR mutation (G465R) following cetuximab therapy benefited from Sym004 therapy. Sym004 is an active drug in MCRC resistant to cetuximab/panitumumab mediated by EGFR mutations. EGFR mutations are potential biomarkers of response to Sym004 to be evaluated in ongoing large clinical trials. Clin Cancer Res; 22(13); 3260-7. ©2016 AACR.",cancer

Responses of often or sometimes were considered to represent a level of breathlessness sufficient to warrant clinical attention. The prevalence of breathlessness is described overall and in subpopulations, then rates of associated symptoms, well-being, and health services use of participants who were breathless are compared with rates of those who were not. The risk of decline in activities of daily living (ADLs) and death through 2012 was estimated by creating a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for age, sex, race and ethnicity, and education.|Twenty-five percent of participants reported breathlessness. The prevalence of breathlessness was higher in certain subpopulations: chronic lung disease (63%), multimorbidity (≥2 chronic conditions) (45%), current smokers (38%), heart disease (36%), obesity (body mass index ≥30.0 kg/m(2) ) (33%), and education less than high school (32%). Breathlessness was associated with higher rates of depression, anxiety, and severe fatigue; lower ratings of well-being; and higher rates of clinic and emergency department visits and hospitalizations (all P < .001). Breathlessness predicted ADL decline over 5 years (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.22-1.68) and death (aHR 1.62, 95% CI = 1.32-2.02).|One in four adults aged 70 and older in the United States experiences breathlessness, which is associated with lack of well-being, greater health services use, and a 40% greater risk of worsened function and 60% greater risk of death over the next 5 years.",nonCancer
1030,Gemcitabine chemoresistance and molecular markers associated with gemcitabine transport and metabolism in human pancreatic cancer cells.,"To identify predictive molecular markers for gemcitabine resistance, we investigated changes in the expression of four genes associated with gemcitabine transport and metabolism during the development of acquired gemcitabine resistance of pancreatic cancer cell lines. The expression levels of human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), RRM1, and RRM2 mRNA were analysed by real-time light cycler-PCR in various subclones during the development of acquired resistance to gemcitabine. Real-time light cycler-PCR demonstrated that the expression levels of either RRM1 or RRM2 progressively increased during the development of gemcitabine resistance. Expression of dCK was slightly increased in cells resistant to lower concentrations of gemcitabine, but was decreased below the undetectable level in higher concentration-resistant subclones. Expression of hENT1 was increased in the development of gemcitabine resistance. As acquired resistance to gemcitabine seems to correlate with the balance of these four factors, we calculated the ratio of hENT1 x dCK/RRM1 x RRM2 gene expression in gemcitabine-resistant subclones. The ratio of gene expression decreased progressively with development of acquired resistance in gemcitabine-resistant subclones. Furthermore, the expression ratio significantly correlated with gemcitabine sensitivity in eight pancreatic cancer cell lines, whereas no single gene expression level correlated with the sensitivity. These results suggest that the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine is determined by the ratio of four factors involved in gemcitabine transport and metabolism. The ratio of the four gene expression levels correlates with acquired gemcitabine-resistance in pancreatic cancer cells, and may be useful as a predictive marker for the efficacy of gemcitabine therapy in pancreatic cancer patients.",cancer
807,Combined targeting of MEK and PI3K/mTOR effector pathways is necessary to effectively inhibit NRAS mutant melanoma in vitro and in vivo.,"Activating mutations in the neuroblastoma rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) gene are common genetic events in malignant melanoma being found in 15-25% of cases. NRAS is thought to activate both mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and PI3K signaling in melanoma cells. We studied the influence of different components on the MAP/extracellular signal-regulated (ERK) kinase (MEK) and PI3K/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-signaling cascade in NRAS mutant melanoma cells. In general, these cells were more sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with inhibition in the PI3K/mTOR cascade. Combined targeting of MEK and PI3K was superior to MEK and mTOR1,2 inhibition in all NRAS mutant melanoma cell lines tested, suggesting that PI3K signaling is more important for cell survival in NRAS mutant melanoma when MEK is inhibited. However, targeting of PI3K/mTOR1,2 in combination with MEK inhibitors is necessary to effectively abolish growth of NRAS mutant melanoma cells in vitro and regress xenografted NRAS mutant melanoma. Furthermore, we showed that MEK and PI3K/mTOR1,2 inhibition is synergistic. Expression analysis confirms that combined MEK and PI3K/mTOR1,2 inhibition predominantly influences genes in the rat sarcoma (RAS) pathway and growth factor receptor pathways, which signal through MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR, respectively. Our results suggest that combined targeting of the MEK/ERK and PI3K/mTOR pathways has antitumor activity and might serve as a therapeutic option in the treatment of NRAS mutant melanoma, for which there are currently no effective therapies.",cancer
1792,An Entropy-Based Analysis of Lane Changing Behavior: An Interactive Approach.,"As a novelty, this paper proposes the nonadditive entropy framework for the description of driver behaviors during lane changing. The authors also state that this entropy framework governs the lane changing behavior in traffic flow in accordance with the long-range vehicular interactions and traffic safety.|Nonadditive entropy framework has been the new generalized theory of thermo-statistical mechanics. Vehicular interactions during lane changing are considered within this framework. The interactive approach for the lane changing behavior of the drivers is presented in the given traffic flow scenarios of the paper. According to the traffic flow scenarios, four categories of traffic flow and driver behaviors are obtained. Through the scenarios, the comparative analyses of nonadditive and additive entropy domains are also provided.|Two quadrants of the categories belong to the nonadditive entropy, the rest are involved in the additive entropy domain. Driving behaviors are extracted and the scenarios depict that nonadditivity matches safe driving well, whereas additivity corresponds to unsafe driving. Furthermore, the cooperative traffic system is considered in nonadditivity where the long-range interactions are present. However, the uncooperative traffic system falls into additivity domain. The analyses also state that there would be possible traffic flow transitions among the quadrants. This paper shows that lane changing behavior could be generalized as nonadditive, having additivity as a special case, based on the given traffic conditions.|The nearest and close neighbor models are well within the conventional additive entropy framework. In this paper, both the long-range vehicular interactions and safe driving behavior in the traffic are handled in the nonadditive entropy domain. It is also inferred that Tsallis entropy region would correspond to mandatory lane changing behavior, whereas additive and either extensive or nonextensive (Boltzmann-Gibbs) entropy region would match discretionary lane changing behavior. This paper states that behaviors of drivers would be in nonadditive entropy domain to provide safe traffic stream, and hence a vehicle accident prevention in mind.",nonCancer
1469,Serotonin Deficiency Rescues Lactation on Day 1 in Mice Fed a High Fat Diet.,"Obesity is an inflammatory state associated with delayed lactogenesis stage II and altered mammary gland morphology. Serotonin mediates inflammation and mammary gland involution. The objective of this study was to determine if a genetic deficiency of tryptophan hydroxylase 1, the rate-limiting enzyme in peripheral serotonin synthesis, would result in an improved ability to lactate in dams fed a high fat diet. Twenty-six female mice were fed a high (HFD) or low fat (LFD) diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. Fourteen mice were genetically deficient for Tph1 (Tph1-/-), and twelve were wild type. Milk yield, pup mortality, and dam weights were recorded and milk samples were collected. On day 10 of lactation, dams were sacrificed and mammary glands were harvested for RT-PCR and histological evaluation. HFD dams weighed more than LFD dams at the onset of lactation. WT HFD dams were unable to lactate on day 1 of lactation and exhibited increased pup mortality relative to all other treatments, including Tph1-/- HFD dams. mRNA expression of immune markers C-X-C motif chemokine 5 and tumor necrosis factor alpha were elevated in WT HFD mammary glands. Mammary gland histology showed a reduced number of alveoli in WT compared to Tph1-/- dams, regardless of diet, and the alveoli of HFD dams were smaller than those of LFD dams. Finally, fatty acid profile in milk was dynamic in both early and peak lactation, with reduced de novo synthesis of fatty acids on day 10 of lactation in the HFD groups. Administration of a HFD to C57BL/6 dams produced an obese phenotype in the mammary gland, which was alleviated by a genetic deficiency of Tph1. Serotonin may modulate the effects of obesity on the mammary gland, potentially contributing to the delayed onset of lactogenesis seen in obese women.",nonCancer

2306,"Short-term exposure to predation affects body elemental composition, climbing speed and survival ability in Drosophila melanogaster.","Factors such as temperature, habitat, larval density, food availability and food quality substantially affect organismal development. In addition, risk of predation has a complex impact on the behavioural and morphological life history responses of prey. Responses to predation risk seem to be mediated by physiological stress, which is an adaptation for maintaining homeostasis and improving survivorship during life-threatening situations. We tested whether predator exposure during the larval phase of development has any influence on body elemental composition, energy reserves, body size, climbing speed and survival ability of adult Drosophila melanogaster. Fruit fly larvae were exposed to predation by jumping spiders (Phidippus apacheanus), and the percentage of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content, extracted lipids, escape response and survival were measured from predator-exposed and control adult flies. The results revealed predation as an important determinant of adult phenotype formation and survival ability. D. melanogaster reared together with spiders had a higher concentration of body N (but equal body C), a lower body mass and lipid reserves, a higher climbing speed and improved adult survival ability. The results suggest that the potential of predators to affect the development and the adult phenotype of D. melanogaster is high enough to use predators as a more natural stimulus in laboratory experiments when testing, for example, fruit fly memory and learning ability, or when comparing natural populations living under different predation pressures.",nonCancer
1093,Targeting p300 Addiction in CBP-Deficient Cancers Causes Synthetic Lethality by Apoptotic Cell Death due to Abrogation of MYC Expression.,"Loss-of-function mutations in the CBP/CREBBP gene, which encodes a histone acetyltransferase (HAT), are present in a variety of human tumors, including lung, bladder, gastric, and hematopoietic cancers. Consequently, development of a molecular targeting method capable of specifically killing CBP-deficient cancer cells would greatly improve cancer therapy. Functional screening of synthetic-lethal genes in CBP-deficient cancers identified the CBP paralog p300/EP300 Ablation of p300 in CBP-knockout and CBP-deficient cancer cells induced G1-S cell-cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis. Genome-wide gene expression analysis revealed that MYC is a major factor responsible for the synthetic lethality. Indeed, p300 ablation in CBP-deficient cells caused downregulation of MYC expression via reduction of histone acetylation in its promoter, and this lethality was rescued by exogenous MYC expression. The p300-HAT inhibitor C646 specifically suppressed the growth of CBP-deficient lung and hematopoietic cancer cells in vitro and in vivo; thus p300 is a promising therapeutic target for treatment of CBP-deficient cancers. Targeting synthetic-lethal partners of genes mutated in cancer holds great promise for treating patients without activating driver gene alterations. Here, we propose a ""synthetic lethal-based therapeutic strategy"" for CBP-deficient cancers by inhibition of the p300 HAT activity.

A number of studies reported the association between methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism and AAA risk, but substantial controversial findings were observed and the strength of the association remains unclear.|The aim of this study was to investigate the aforementioned association in the overall population and different subgroups.|PUBMED and EMBASE databases were searched until March 2016 to identify eligible studies, restricted to humans and articles published in English. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the susceptibility to AAA. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted on features of the population, such as ethnicity, sex of the participants, and study design (source of control).|Twelve case-control studies on MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AAA risk, including 3555 cases and 6568 case-free controls were identified. The results revealed no significant association between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and AAA risk in the overall population and within Caucasian or Asian subpopulations in all 5 genetic models. Further subgroup meta-analysis indicated that significantly increased risks were observed among cases with a mean age <70 years (OR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10-2.12, P = 0.02), cases with prevalence of smoking <60% (OR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.02-1.90, P = 0.04), and cases with aneurysm diameter ≥55 mm (OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.07-2.24, P = 0.02) in the dominant genetic model. No publication bias was detected in the present study.|In conclusion, our comprehensive meta-analysis suggests that the MTHFR C677T polymorphism may play an important role in AAA susceptibility, especially in younger, non-smoking, larger AAA-diameter subgroups of patients.",nonCancer
348,Efficacy of Imatinib in Patients with Platelet-Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha-Mutated Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.,"The incidence of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harboring platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) mutations is low, therefore further investigation of the efficacy of imatinib in this subgroup was needed. Patients with PDGFRA-mutant GISTs who received imatinib as primary therapy for advanced disease between January 2000 and June 2012 were identified from the GIST registry of Asan Medical Center, Seoul, Korea. KIT and PDGFRA genotyping in 823 patients identified 18 patients (2%) with PDGFRA mutations who were treated with first-line imatinib. Exon 18 D842V substitution, non-D842V exon 18 mutations, and exon 12 mutations were detected in nine (50%), four (22%), and five (28%) patients, respectively. Objective response rate differed significantly between patients with the D842V mutation and those with non-D842V mutations (0% [0/5] vs. 71% [5/7], p=0.03). In all patients, median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was 24.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0 to 57.2) and 51.2 months (95% CI, 37.1 to 65.3), respectively. Significantly, poorer PFS was observed for patients with D842V-mutant GISTs than those with non-D842V PDGFRA-mutant GISTs: median 3.8 months (95% CI, 1.4 to 6.3) versus 29.5 months (95% CI, 18.3 to 40.7) (p < 0.001). Patients with the D842V mutation had poorer OS than those with non-D842V PDGFRA mutations: median 25.2 months (95% CI, 12.7 to 37.8) versus 59.8 months (95% CI, 43.0 to 76.5) (p=0.02). Imatinib is active against non-D842V PDGFRA-mutant GISTs, whereas GISTs harboring the D842V mutation are primarily resistant to imatinib.",cancer
2129,Computational methods and challenges in hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry.,"Hydrogen/Deuterium exchange (HDX) has been applied, since the 1930s, as an analytical tool to study the structure and dynamics of (small) biomolecules. The popularity of using HDX to study proteins increased drastically in the last two decades due to the successful combination with mass spectrometry (MS). Together with this growth in popularity, several technological advances have been made, such as improved quenching and fragmentation. As a consequence of these experimental improvements and the increased use of protein-HDXMS, large amounts of complex data are generated, which require appropriate analysis. Computational analysis of HDXMS requires several steps. A typical workflow for proteins consists of identification of (non-)deuterated peptides or fragments of the protein under study (local analysis), or identification of the deuterated protein as a whole (global analysis); determination of the deuteration level; estimation of the protection extent or exchange rates of the labile backbone amide hydrogen atoms; and a statistically sound interpretation of the estimated protection extent or exchange rates. Several algorithms, specifically designed for HDX analysis, have been proposed. They range from procedures that focus on one specific step in the analysis of HDX data to complete HDX workflow analysis tools. In this review, we provide an overview of the computational methods and discuss outstanding challenges. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Mass Spec Rev.",nonCancer

2254,CenoDerm vs. Fascia lata for the Prevention of Dorsal Nasal Irregularities in Rhinoplasty.,"Dorsal nasal irregularity is a complication of rhinoplasty surgery, mostly seen in patients with thin skin. Acellular dermis (CenoDerm) and homologous fascia lata covering the nasal bone cartilage structure have been used to achieve a smooth surface. In this study, we aimed to investigate clinical outcomes using these two materials.|After a standard rhinoplasty procedure, a layer of the acellular dermis or homologous fascia lata was placed in the pocket of the dorsum. Patients were evaluated for clinical outcomes at 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure.|Forty-two of 68 patients completed the follow-up period. Patient satisfaction was higher in the homologous fascia lata group. Similarly, nasal dorsum inspection and palpation results were better in the homologous fascia lata group compared with the CenoDerm group but was significant in palpation (P=0.00). There was no complete absorption in the homologous fascia lata group 6 months after surgery (P= 0.04 vs. CenoDerm) but no significant difference was observed at 12 months.|Homologous fascia lata is better than acellular dermis in preventing dorsal nasal irregularity after rhinoplasty in thin-skinned patients.",nonCancer
132,Inhibition of the transforming activity of FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutants from AML patients by a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.,"FLT3 is a receptor tyrosine kinase that may play a role in a significant proportion of leukemias. In addition to being aberrantly expressed in acute leukemias, activating mutations of the FLT3 gene have been found in patients with AML, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and more rarely, ALL. Internal tandem duplications (ITDs) of the FLT3 gene have been detected in 17-34% of patients with AML and portend a poor prognosis for these patients. FLT3 receptors containing ITD mutations (FLT3/ITDs) are constitutively activated in the absence of FLT3 ligand (FL) stimulation leading to the activation of downstream signaling proteins, including ERK and STAT 5. FLT3 activity, therefore, is a logical target for therapeutic intervention. AG1296 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the tyrphostin class that shows inhibitory activity for wild-type FLT3, in addition to the PDGF and c-KIT receptors. We examined the inhibitory effects of AG1296 on FLT3/ITDs isolated from AML patients in the IL-3-dependent cell line, Ba/F3, as well as in primary leukemia samples from AML patients. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that FLT3/ITDs were constitutively phosphorylated in the absence of FL. The auto-phosphorylation of FLT3/ITDs was inhibited by AG1296 with an IC(50) of approximately 1 microM. FLT3/ITDs were associated with constitutive phosphorylation of ERK, STAT 5A, STAT 5B, CBL, VAV and SHP2 in Ba/F3 cells. The phosphorylation of these downstream signaling molecules was suppressed in a dose-responsive fashion by AG1296. AG1296 inhibited IL-3 independent growth and induced apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells transformed by FLT3/ITDs. AG1296 also inhibited FLT3 auto-phosphorylation, and induced a cytotoxic effect, in primary AML cells. These findings suggest that inhibiting the activity of FLT3 may have a therapeutic value in some leukemias expressing FLT3/ITDs.",cancer
2176,Piwil2 is reactivated by HPV oncoproteins and initiates cell reprogramming via epigenetic regulation during cervical cancer tumorigenesis.,"The human papillomavirus (HPV) oncoproteins E6 and E7 are risk factors that are primarily responsible for the initiation and progression of cervical cancer, and they play a key role in immortalization and transformation by reprogramming differentiating host epithelial cells. It is unclear how cervical epithelial cells transform into tumor-initiating cells (TICs). Here, we observed that the germ stem cell protein Piwil2 is expressed in pre-cancerous and malignant lesions of the cervix and cervical cancer cell lines with the exception of the non-HPV-infected C33a cell line. Knockdown of Piwil2 by shRNA led to a marked reduction in proliferation and colony formation, in vivo tumorigenicity, chemo-resistance, and the proportion of cancer stem-like cells. In contrast, Piwil2 overexpression induced malignant transformation of HaCaT cells and the acquisition of tumor-initiating capabilities. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed embryonic stem cell (ESC) identity, malignant biological behavior, and specifically, activation targets of the cell reprogramming factors c-Myc, Klf4, Nanog, Oct4, and Sox2 in Piwil2-overexpressing HaCaT cells. We further confirmed that E6 and E7 reactivated Piwil2 and that E6 and E7 overexpression resulted in a similar gene-set enrichment pattern as Piwil2 overexpression in HaCaT cells. Moreover, Piwil2 overexpression or E6 and E7 activation induced H3K9 acetylation but reduced H3K9 trimethylation, which contributed to the epigenetic reprogramming and ESC signature maintenance, as predicted previously. Our study demonstrates that Piwil2, reactivated by the HPV oncoproteins E6 and E7, plays an essential role in the transformation of cervical epithelial cells to TICs via epigenetics-based cell reprogramming.",nonCancer

1095,Combining lapatinib and pertuzumab to overcome lapatinib resistance due to NRG1-mediated signalling in HER2-amplified breast cancer.,"Acquired resistance to lapatinib, an inhibitor of EGFR and HER2 kinases, is common. We found that reactivation of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 occurred within 24 hours of lapatinib treatment after their initial dephosphorylation. This was associated with increased expression of NRG1 in cells treated with lapatinib. Exogenous NRG1 partially rescued breast cancer cells from growth inhibition by lapatinib. In addition, both parental and lapatinib-resistant breast cancer cells were sensitive to SGP1, which inhibits binding of NRG1 and other HER3 ligands. Addition of pertuzumab to lapatinib further inhibited NRG1-induced signalling, which was not fully inhibited by either drug alone. In animal model, a combination of pertuzumab to lapatinib induced a greater tumor regression than either lapatinib or pertuzumab monotherapy. This novel combination treatment may provide a promising strategy in clinical HER2-targeted therapy and may inhibit a subset of lapatinib-resistant breast cancer, although the group of patients that will respond to this therapy requires further stratification.",cancer
978,The association of Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deletion and prostate cancer risk: A meta-analysis.,"Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) deleted on chromosome 10, a tumor suppressor that negatively regulates the phosphoinositide-3-kinase(PI3K) which has been implicated in a number of human malignancies including prostate cancer. However the prognostic value of PTEN deletion in prostate cancer patient's diagnosis and the mechanism of PTEN deletion in prostate cancer development still remain unclear. A meta-analysis of 26 published studies including 8097 prostate cancer patients was performed. Compared to PTEN normal patients, PTEN deletion patients showed a higher aggressive Gleason score(OR: 1.284, 95%CI=1.145-1.439) and pathological stage(OR: 1.628, 95%CI=1.270-2.087) which generally had a higher risk in prostate replace(HR: 1.738, 95%CI=1.264-2.390). Significant association between PTEN deletion and ERG rearrangements in prostate cancer development was also proved that compared to PTEN normal patients, patients with PTEN deletion showed a higher risk in ERG rearrangements(OR: 1.345, 95%CI=1.102-1.788). This study indicated that patients with PTEN deletion were associated with higher pathological stage or Gleason score and a higher risk in prostate cancer replace potentially represent a novel clinically relevant event to identify individuals at increased risk for the occurrence, progression and prognosis of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer patients with PTEN deletion usually had a higher risk in ERG rearrangements than other patients may be a potential new area for identifying poor prognosis patients and selecting patients for targeted therapies which required confirmation through adequately designed prospective studies.",cancer
2027,ctDNA dynamics: a novel indicator to track resistance in metastatic breast cancer treated with anti-HER2 therapy.,"Most studies utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to monitor disease interrogated only one or a few genes and failed to develop workable criteria to inform clinical practice. We evaluated the feasibility of detecting resistance to anti-HER2 therapy by serial gene-panel ctDNA sequencing.|Primary therapeutic resistance was identified in 6 out of 14 patients with events of progressive disease. For this subset comparison of pre- and post-treatment ctDNA assay results revealed that HER2 amplification concurred with disease progression (4/6, 66.7%). Mutations in TP53 (3/6, 50.0%) and genes implicated in the PI3K/mTOR pathway (3/6, 50.0%) were also dominant markers of resistance. Together, resistance to HER2 blockade should be indicated during treatment if any of the following situations applies: 1) recurrence or persistence of HER2 amplification in the blood; 2) emergence or ≥20% increase in the fraction of mutations in any of these resistance-related genes including TP53/PIK3CA/MTOR/PTEN. Compared with CT scans, dynamic ctDNA profiling utilizing pre-defined criteria was sensitive in identifying drug resistance (sensitivity 85.7%, specificity 55.0%), with a concordance rate up to 82.1%. Besides, the ctDNA criteria had a discriminating role in the prognosis of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.|52 plasma samples were prospectively collected from 18 patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who were treated with an oral anti-HER1/HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01937689). ctDNA was assayed by gene-panel target-capture next-generation sequencing.|Longitudinal gene-panel ctDNA sequencing could be exploited to determine resistance and guide the precise administration of anti-HER2 targeted therapy in the metastatic setting.",nonCancer
1983,"Epilepsy, Ammon's horn sclerosis, and Camille Bouchet.","Increasing interest into the relationship between Ammon's horn sclerosis (hippocampal sclerosis) and epilepsy seems to have developed after 1880 when Sommer's paper appeared. Bouchet and Cazauvieilh had published the original description of the hippocampal anatomical abnormality in 1825 while attempting to locate the cerebral sites of origin of epilepsy and insanity. However, they offered no interpretation of the significance of the structural change. What has sometimes not been noticed in the subsequent literature is that, after a further investigation, in 1853, Bouchet described the change in 18 of 43 additional brains from persons with epilepsy. Despite this frequency of occurrence of the hippocampal abnormality, he concluded that epileptic seizures had no single site of origin in the brain. Before most of his contemporaries and their successors, he began to propose the idea that all epileptic seizures were symptoms of various, though mostly cerebral, disorders. In doing this, he tended to be reluctant to accept the view that epilepsy was a disease in its own right.",nonCancer

The study was conducted in 2014 on a sample of 85 adolescents (90.6% females) who participated at follow-up (85.9%) out of the 99 (49.7%) baseline respondents. All adolescents were recruited from a specialized suicide-prevention clinic in Denmark. Through multivariate logistic regression analyses, we examined whether baseline suicidal behavior predicted subsequent suicidal behavior (actual attempts and suicidal behavior of any type, including preparatory acts, aborted, interrupted and actual attempts; mean follow-up of 80.8 days, SD = 52.4). Furthermore, we examined whether suicidal ideation severity and intensity incrementally predicted suicidal behavior at follow-up over and above suicidal behavior at baseline. Actual suicide attempts at baseline strongly predicted suicide attempts at follow-up. Baseline suicidal ideation severity and intensity did not significantly predict future actual attempts over and above baseline attempts. The suicidal ideation intensity items deterrents and duration were significant predictors of subsequent actual attempts after adjustment for baseline suicide attempts and suicidal behavior of any type, respectively. Suicidal ideation severity and intensity, and the intensity items frequency, duration and deterrents, all significantly predicted any type of suicidal behavior at follow-up, also after adjusting for baseline suicidal behavior. The present study points to an incremental predictive validity of the C-SSRS suicidal ideation scales for short-term suicidal behavior of any type among high-risk adolescents.",nonCancer
178,The use of molecular profiling to predict survival after chemotherapy for diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.,"The survival of patients with diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma after chemotherapy is influenced by molecular features of the tumors. We used the gene-expression profiles of these lymphomas to develop a molecular predictor of survival. Biopsy samples of diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma from 240 patients were examined for gene expression with the use of DNA microarrays and analyzed for genomic abnormalities. Subgroups with distinctive gene-expression profiles were defined on the basis of hierarchical clustering. A molecular predictor of risk was constructed with the use of genes with expression patterns that were associated with survival in a preliminary group of 160 patients and was then tested in a validation group of 80 patients. The accuracy of this predictor was compared with that of the international prognostic index. Three gene-expression subgroups--germinal-center B-cell-like, activated B-cell-like, and type 3 diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma--were identified. Two common oncogenic events in diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma, bcl-2 translocation and c-rel amplification, were detected only in the germinal-center B-cell-like subgroup. Patients in this subgroup had the highest five-year survival rate. To identify other molecular determinants of outcome, we searched for individual genes with expression patterns that correlated with survival in the preliminary group of patients. Most of these genes fell within four gene-expression signatures characteristic of germinal-center B cells, proliferating cells, reactive stromal and immune cells in the lymph node, or major-histocompatibility-complex class II complex. We used 17 genes to construct a predictor of overall survival after chemotherapy. This gene-based predictor and the international prognostic index were independent prognostic indicators. DNA microarrays can be used to formulate a molecular predictor of survival after chemotherapy for diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma.",cancer

2111,Risk Factors Associated with Incident Syphilis in a Cohort of High-Risk Men in Peru.,"Syphilis is concentrated among high-risk groups, but the epidemiology of syphilis reinfection is poorly understood. We characterized factors associated with syphilis incidence, including reinfection, in a high-risk cohort in Peru.|Participants in the NIMH CPOL trial were assessed at baseline and 2 annual visits with HIV/STI testing and behavioral surveys. Participants diagnosed with syphilis also attended 4- and 9-month visits. All participants underwent syphilis testing with RPR screening and TPPA confirmation. Antibiotic treatment was provided according to CDC guidelines. Reinfection was defined as a 4-fold titer increase or recurrence of seroreactivity after successful treatment with subsequent negative RPR titers. The longitudinal analysis used a Possion generalized estimating equations model with backward selection of variables in the final model (criteria P <0.02).|Of 2,709 participants, 191 (7.05%) were RPR-reactive (median 1:8, range 1:1-1:1024) with TPPA confirmation. There were 119 total cases of incident syphilis, which included both reinfection and first-time incident cases. In the bivariate analysis, the oldest 2 quartiles of age (incidence ratio (IR) 3.84; P <0.001 and IR 8.15; P <0.001) and being MSM/TW (IR 6.48; P <0.001) were associated with higher risk of incident syphilis infection.

498,First-in-man clinical trial of the oral pan-AKT inhibitor MK-2206 in patients with advanced solid tumors.,"AKT signaling is frequently deregulated in human cancers. MK-2206 is a potent, oral allosteric inhibitor of all AKT isoforms with antitumor activity in preclinical models. A phase I study of MK-2206 was conducted to investigate its safety, maximum-tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PKs), pharmacodynamics (PDs), and preliminary antitumor efficacy. Patients with advanced solid tumors received MK-2206 on alternate days. Paired tumor biopsies were mandated at the MTD for biomarker studies. PD studies incorporated tumor and hair follicle analyses, and putative predictive biomarker studies included tumor somatic mutation analyses and immunohistochemistry for phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) loss. Thirty-three patients received MK-2206 at 30, 60, 75, or 90 mg on alternate days. Dose-limiting toxicities included skin rash and stomatitis, establishing the MTD at 60 mg. Drug-related toxicities included skin rash (51.5%), nausea (36.4%), pruritus (24.2%), hyperglycemia (21.2%), and diarrhea (21.2%). PKs (area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 48 hours and maximum measured plasma concentration) were dose proportional. Phosphorylated serine 473 AKT declined in all tumor biopsies assessed (P = .015), and phosphorylated threonine 246 proline-rich AKT substrate 40 was suppressed in hair follicles at 6 hours (P = .008), on days 7 (P = .028) and 15 (P = .025) with MK-2206; reversible hyperglycemia and increases in insulin c-peptide were also observed, confirming target modulation. A patient with pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PTEN loss; KRAS G12D mutation) treated at 60 mg on alternate days experienced a decrease of approximately 60% in cancer antigen 19-9 levels and 23% shrinkage in tumor measurements. Two patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors had minor tumor responses. MK-2206 was well tolerated, with evidence of AKT signaling blockade. Rational combination trials are ongoing to maximize clinical benefit with this therapeutic strategy.",cancer
680,Nanofluidic Digital PCR and Extended Genotyping of RAS and BRAF for Improved Selection of Metastatic Colorectal Cancer Patients for Anti-EGFR Therapies.,"The clinical significance of low-frequent RAS pathway-mutated alleles and the optimal sensitivity cutoff value in the prediction of response to anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) patients remains controversial. We aimed to evaluate the added value of genotyping an extended RAS panel using a robust nanofluidic digital PCR (dPCR) approach. A panel of 34 hotspots, including RAS (KRAS and NRAS exons 2/3/4) and BRAF (V600E), was analyzed in tumor FFPE samples from 102 mCRC patients treated with anti-EGFR therapy. dPCR was compared with conventional quantitative PCR (qPCR). Response rates, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were correlated to the mutational status and the mutated allele fraction. Tumor response evaluations were not available in 9 patients and were excluded for response rate analysis. Twenty-two percent of patients were positive for one mutation with qPCR (mutated alleles ranged from 2.1% to 66.6%). Analysis by dPCR increased the number of positive patients to 47%. Mutated alleles for patients only detected by dPCR ranged from 0.04% to 10.8%. An inverse correlation between the fraction of mutated alleles and radiologic response was observed. ROC analysis showed that a fraction of 1% or higher of any mutated alleles offered the best predictive value for all combinations of RAS and BRAF analysis. In addition, this threshold also optimized prediction both PFS and OS. We conclude that mutation testing using an extended gene panel, including RAS and BRAF with a threshold of 1% improved prediction of response to anti-EGFR therapy.

2098,Discovery and clinical introduction of first-in-class imipridone ONC201.,"ONC201 is the founding member of a novel class of anti-cancer compounds called imipridones that is currently in Phase II clinical trials in multiple advanced cancers. Since the discovery of ONC201 as a p53-independent inducer of TRAIL gene transcription, preclinical studies have determined that ONC201 has anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects against a broad range of tumor cells but not normal cells. The mechanism of action of ONC201 involves engagement of PERK-independent activation of the integrated stress response, leading to tumor upregulation of DR5 and dual Akt/ERK inactivation, and consequent Foxo3a activation leading to upregulation of the death ligand TRAIL. ONC201 is orally active with infrequent dosing in animals models, causes sustained pharmacodynamic effects, and is not genotoxic. The first-in-human clinical trial of ONC201 in advanced aggressive refractory solid tumors confirmed that ONC201 is exceptionally well-tolerated and established the recommended phase II dose of 625 mg administered orally every three weeks defined by drug exposure comparable to efficacious levels in preclinical models. Clinical trials are evaluating the single agent efficacy of ONC201 in multiple solid tumors and hematological malignancies and exploring alternative dosing regimens. In addition, chemical analogs that have shown promise in other oncology indications are in pre-clinical development. In summary, the imipridone family that comprises ONC201 and its chemical analogs represent a new class of anti-cancer therapy with a unique mechanism of action being translated in ongoing clinical trials.",nonCancer
1556,Oxytocin in Animal Models of Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder is a behavioral disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction and communication together with the presence of stereotyped behaviors and restricted interests. Although highly genetic, its etiology is complex which correlates with the extensive heterogeneity found in its clinical manifestation, adding to the challenge of understanding its pathophysiology and develop targeted pharmacotherapies. The neuropeptide oxytocin is part of a highly conserved system involved in the regulation of social behavior, and both animal and human research have shown that variation in the oxytocin system accounts for interindividual differences in the expression of social behaviors in mammals. In autism, recent studies in human patients and animal models are starting to reveal that alterations in the oxytocin system are more common than previously anticipated. Genetic variation in the key players involved in the system (i.e. oxytocin receptor, oxytocin and CD38) have been found associated with autism in humans, and animal models of the disorder converge in an altered oxytocin system and/or dysfunction in oxytocin related biological processes. Further, oxytocin administration exerts a behavioral and neurobiological response and thus, the oxytocin system has become a promising potential therapeutical target for autism. Animal models represent a valuable tool to aid in the research into the potential therapeutic use of oxytocin. In this review, I aim to discuss the main findings related to oxytocin research in autism with a focus on findings in animal models. This article is protected by copyright.

681,An African-specific polymorphism in the TP53 gene impairs p53 tumor suppressor function in a mouse model.,"A nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism at codon 47 in TP53 exists in African-descent populations (P47S, rs1800371; referred to here as S47). Here we report that, in human cell lines and a mouse model, the S47 variant exhibits a modest decrease in apoptosis in response to most genotoxic stresses compared with wild-type p53 but exhibits a significant defect in cell death induced by cisplatin. We show that, compared with wild-type p53, S47 has nearly indistinguishable transcriptional function but shows impaired ability to transactivate a subset of p53 target genes, including two involved in metabolism:Gls2(glutaminase 2) and Sco2 We also show that human and mouse cells expressing the S47 variant are markedly resistant to cell death by agents that induce ferroptosis (iron-mediated nonapoptotic cell death). We show that mice expressing S47 in homozygous or heterozygous form are susceptible to spontaneous cancers of diverse histological types. Our data suggest that the S47 variant may contribute to increased cancer risk in individuals of African descent, and our findings highlight the need to assess the contribution of this variant to cancer risk in these populations. These data also confirm the potential relevance of metabolism and ferroptosis to tumor suppression by p53.",cancer
717,Identification of anaplastic lymphoma kinase fusions in renal cancer: large-scale immunohistochemical screening by the intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer method.,"Several promising molecular-targeted drugs are used for advanced renal cancers. However, complete remission is rarely achieved, because none of the drugs targets a key molecule that is specific to the cancer, or is associated with ""oncogene addiction"" (dependence on one or a few oncogenes for cell survival) of renal cancer. Recently, an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion, vinculin-ALK, has been reported in pediatric renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cases who have a history of sickle cell trait. In this context, ALK inhibitor therapy would constitute a therapeutic advance, as has previously been demonstrated with lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and anaplastic large cell lymphomas. Anti-ALK immunohistochemistry was used to screen 355 tumor tissues, using the intercalated antibody-enhanced polymer (iAEP) method. The cohort consisted of 255 clear cell RCCs, 32 papillary RCCs, 34 chromophobe RCCs, 6 collecting duct carcinomas, 10 unclassified RCCs, 6 sarcomatoid RCCs, and 12 other tumors. Two patients (36- and 53-year-old females) were positive for ALK as determined by iAEP immunohistochemistry. Using 5'- rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends, we detected TPM3-ALK and EML4-ALK in these tumors. The results of this study were confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization assays. The 2 ALK-positive RCCs were unclassified (mixed features of papillary, mucinous cribriform, and solid patterns with rhabdoid cells) and papillary subtype. They comprised 2.3% of non-clear cell RCCs (2 of 88) and 3.7% of non-clear cell and nonchromophobe RCCs (2 of 54). The results of this study indicate that ALK fusions also exist in adult RCC cases without uncommon backgrounds. These findings confirm the potential of ALK inhibitor therapy for selected cases of RCC.",cancer
1431,Clinical Observations About the Potential Benefits and Pitfalls of Between-Session Contacts with Borderline Patients.,"Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) has a reputation for being a challenging disorder to treat due to the nature of the illness. With the development of evidence-based treatments, therapists are becoming more skilled at successfully helping this cohort of patients. A common factor associated with all validated treatments for BPD is the active involvement of therapists. For example, DBT is one treatment where therapists are expected to be available to patients for coaching outside of sessions. However, understanding the benefits and pitfalls associated with therapists' accessibility in between sessions is relevant to any treatment with intersession contact. In this article, three benefits of intersession contact are described: to generalize the use of skills, to improve understanding of the patient's needs, and to facilitate an alliance. This article also addresses the pitfalls of therapists being so accessible to patients. Both the benefits and pitfalls of intersession contact are illustrated using case vignettes. Assessing the function served by a patient's contact in between sessions is an important way to determine whether such contact is a productive part of treatment. Recommendations are provided to avoid detrimental outcomes for both the therapist (therapist burnout) and the patient.",nonCancer
46,Wild-type BRAF is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab in metastatic colorectal cancer.,"PURPOSE Cetuximab or panitumumab are effective in 10% to 20% unselected metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. KRAS mutations account for approximately 30% to 40% patients who are not responsive. The serine-threonine kinase BRAF is the principal effector of KRAS. We hypothesized that, in KRAS wild-type patients, BRAF mutations could have a predictive/prognostic value. PATIENTS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed objective tumor responses, time to progression, overall survival (OS), and the mutational status of KRAS and BRAF in 113 tumors from cetuximab- or panitumumab-treated metastatic CRC patients. The effect of the BRAF V600E mutation on cetuximab or panitumumab response was also assessed using cellular models of CRC. Results KRAS mutations were present in 30% of the patients and were associated with resistance to cetuximab or panitumumab (P = .011). The BRAF V600E mutation was detected in 11 of 79 patients who had wild-type KRAS. None of the BRAF-mutated patients responded to treatment, whereas none of the responders carried BRAF mutations (P = .029). BRAF-mutated patients had significantly shorter progression-free survival (P = .011) and OS (P < .0001) than wild-type patients. In CRC cells, the introduction of BRAF V600E allele impaired the therapeutic effect of cetuximab or panitumumab. Treatment with the BRAF inhibitor sorafenib restored sensitivity to panitumumab or cetuximab of CRC cells carrying the V600E allele. CONCLUSION BRAF wild-type is required for response to panitumumab or cetuximab and could be used to select patients who are eligible for the treatment. Double-hit therapies aimed at simultaneous inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor and BRAF warrant exploration in CRC patients carrying the V600E oncogenic mutation.",cancer
2136,Room temperature blue phosphorescence: a combined experimental and theoretical study on the bis-tridentate Ir(iii) metal complexes.,"A series of new bis-tridentate Ir(iii) complexes (1/1b, 2/2b and 3/3b) incorporating both bis(imidazolylidene)benzene and dianionic functional pyrazolyl (or phenyl) pyridine chelates have been synthesized, among which complexes 2 and 2b exhibit intense and structural sky-blue emission in both solution and solid states. In stark contrast, 1/1b is non-emissive in solution, while 3/3b reveals highly red-shifted emission with a featureless spectral profile. This variation in photophysics is associated with the interchange of metal-chelate bonding in the selected tridentate chelate, which affects both the crystal field stabilization energy and the ππ* transition character of the resulting Ir(iii) metal complexes. In 1/1b, the stabilized metal-centered (MC) dd excited states induce a dominant radiationless channel that accounts for the lack of emission in solution. The appreciable ligand-to-ligand charge transfer (LLCT) in 3/3b rationalizes its broad and featureless emission, which is different from the dominant intraligand ππ* transition in 2/2b. The combination of experimental and theoretical approaches thus provides fundamental insight into the influence of chelates as well as the metal-chelate interaction, which is beneficial for the future design of efficient and robust Ir(iii) phosphors for OLED applications.",nonCancer
909,FBXW7 targets mTOR for degradation and cooperates with PTEN in tumor suppression.,"The enzyme mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) is a major target for therapeutic intervention to treat many human diseases, including cancer, but very little is known about the processes that control levels of mTOR protein. Here, we show that mTOR is targeted for ubiquitination and consequent degradation by binding to the tumor suppressor protein FBXW7. Human breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors showed a reciprocal relation between loss of FBXW7 and deletion or mutation of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog), which also activates mTOR. Tumor cell lines harboring deletions or mutations in FBXW7 are particularly sensitive to rapamycin treatment, which suggests that loss of FBXW7 may be a biomarker for human cancers susceptible to treatment with inhibitors of the mTOR pathway.",cancer
1153,"KRAS codon 61, 146 and BRAF mutations predict resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in KRAS codon 12 and 13 wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.","KRAS codons 12 and 13 mutations predict resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) in metastatic colorectal cancer. Also, BRAF V600E mutation has been associated with resistance. Additional KRAS mutations are described in CRC. We investigated the role of KRAS codons 61 and 146 and BRAF V600E mutations in predicting resistance to cetuximab plus irinotecan in a cohort of KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type patients. Among 87 KRAS codons 12 and 13 wild-type patients, KRAS codons 61 and 146 were mutated in 7 and 1 case, respectively. None of mutated patients responded vs 22 of 68 wild type (P=0.096). Eleven patients were not evaluable. KRAS mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (PFS, HR: 0.46, P=0.028). None of 13 BRAF-mutated patients responded vs 24 of 74 BRAF wild type (P=0.016). BRAF mutation was associated with a trend towards shorter PFS (HR: 0.59, P=0.073). In the subgroup of BRAF wild-type patients, KRAS codons 61/146 mutations determined a lower response rate (0 vs 37%, P=0.047) and worse PFS (HR: 0.45, P=0.023). Patients bearing KRAS or BRAF mutations had poorer response rate (0 vs 37%, P=0.0005) and PFS (HR: 0.51, P=0.006) compared with KRAS and BRAF wild-type patients. Assessing KRAS codons 61/146 and BRAF V600E mutations might help optimising the selection of the candidate patients to receive anti-EGFR moAbs.",cancer
642,Adaptive resistance to therapeutic PD-1 blockade is associated with upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints.,"Despite compelling antitumour activity of antibodies targeting the programmed death 1 (PD-1): programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint in lung cancer, resistance to these therapies has increasingly been observed. In this study, to elucidate mechanisms of adaptive resistance, we analyse the tumour immune microenvironment in the context of anti-PD-1 therapy in two fully immunocompetent mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma. In tumours progressing following response to anti-PD-1 therapy, we observe upregulation of alternative immune checkpoints, notably T-cell immunoglobulin mucin-3 (TIM-3), in PD-1 antibody bound T cells and demonstrate a survival advantage with addition of a TIM-3 blocking antibody following failure of PD-1 blockade. Two patients who developed adaptive resistance to anti-PD-1 treatment also show a similar TIM-3 upregulation in blocking antibody-bound T cells at treatment failure. These data suggest that upregulation of TIM-3 and other immune checkpoints may be targetable biomarkers associated with adaptive resistance to PD-1 blockade.",cancer
327,Akt expression and compartmentalization in prediction of clinical outcome in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab.,"Trastuzumab is effective in about half of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway plays an important role in the process of primary and secondary resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapy. We evaluated the relationship between expression, activation and subcellular localization of selected Akt isoforms and response to trastuzumab-based anti-HER2 targeted therapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. Seventy-four women with verified HER2-positive breast cancer were treated with trastuzumab for metastatic disease. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate Akt1, Akt2, pAkt Thr308 and pAkt Ser473 expression. For pAkt, cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were assessed separately. Even though Akt isoforms were expressed in the majority of tumours, activated Akt (pAkt) was present in the cytoplasm only and not in the nucleus in >20% of tumours, and there was no pAkt at all in another 7-13% of tumours. Patients whose tumours showed strong Akt2 expression and had pAkt (pAkt-Thr308 and/or pAkt-Ser473) detectable in the cytoplasm as well as nucleus (n+c), exhibited improved time to progression (TTP) and overall survival from the initiation of trastuzumab therapy (OSt). Patients with tumours with strong Akt2 and pAkt Thr308 (n+c) had superior TTP (17.0 vs. 7.6 months, P=0.024; HR 0.52) and OSt (51.8 vs. 16.8 months, P=0.0009; HR 0.34) compared to other tumours. Similar results were found for strong Akt2 and pAkt Ser473 (n+c): TTP 13.1 vs. 7.2 months (P=0.085, HR 0.62) and OSt 50.8 vs. 17.0 months (P=0.009; HR 0.45). This study is the first to prove the significance of Akt kinase isoform, activity and compartmentalization for the prediction of response to trastuzumab-based therapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.",cancer
2180,Increasing Notch signaling antagonizes PRC2-mediated silencing to promote reprograming of germ cells into neurons.,"Cell-fate reprograming is at the heart of development, yet very little is known about the molecular mechanisms promoting or inhibiting reprograming in intact organisms. In the C. elegans germline, reprograming germ cells into somatic cells requires chromatin perturbation. Here, we describe that such reprograming is facilitated by GLP-1/Notch signaling pathway. This is surprising, since this pathway is best known for maintaining undifferentiated germline stem cells/progenitors. Through a combination of genetics, tissue-specific transcriptome analysis, and functional studies of candidate genes, we uncovered a possible explanation for this unexpected role of GLP-1/Notch. We propose that GLP-1/Notch promotes reprograming by activating specific genes, silenced by the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), and identify the conserved histone demethylase UTX-1 as a crucial GLP-1/Notch target facilitating reprograming. These findings have wide implications, ranging from development to diseases associated with abnormal Notch signaling.",nonCancer
839,Activation of PI3K/Akt pathway by PTEN reduction and PIK3CA mRNA amplification contributes to cisplatin resistance in an ovarian cancer cell line.,"The aim of this study was to understand the role of PIK3CA and PTEN on the resistance of human ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Human ovarian cancer cell OVCAR-3 and cisplatin-resistant subclone OVCAR-3/CDDP cells were used for these studies. The expressions of apoptosis regulating proteins and PI3K/Akt signaling proteins were systematically examined. OVCAR-3/CDDP cells were 4.8-fold more resistant to cisplatin compared to OVCAR-3 cells following 72 h exposure to this drug. This resistance was paralleled with reduced susceptibility to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Apoptotic proteins were differentially expressed in OVCAR-3/CDDP cells, resulting in the inhibition of Bax translocalization. Cisplatin inhibited Akt phosphorylation and activation in OVCAR-3 cells but not in OVCAR-3/CDDP cells. The specific PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin sensitized OVCAR-3/CDDP cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis and decreased cell viability. A low level of PTEN expression was strongly associated with amplified PIK3CA and PI3K/Akt activities in OVCAR-3/CDDP cells. Small interfering RNA knockdown of PTEN and the expression of active p110alpha resulted in a blockade of apoptosis by cisplatin in OVCAR-3 cells. These results collectively indicate that the development of resistance in OVCAR-3 cells was derived by increased PIK3CA transcription and reduction of PTEN expression. These alterations conferred cisplatin resistance to cisplatin through the activation of PI3K/Akt and the inhibition of Bax translocation.",cancer
187,TET2 mutations improve the new European LeukemiaNet risk classification of acute myeloid leukemia: a Cancer and Leukemia Group B study.,"To determine the frequency of TET2 mutations, their associations with clinical and molecular characteristics and outcome, and the associated gene- and microRNA-expression signatures in patients with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Four-hundred twenty-seven patients with CN-AML were analyzed for TET2 mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing and for established prognostic gene mutations. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles were derived using microarrays. TET2 mutations, found in 23% of patients, were associated with older age (P < .001) and higher pretreatment WBC (P = .04) compared with wild-type TET2 (TET2-wt). In the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) favorable-risk group (patients with CN-AML who have mutated CEBPA and/or mutated NPM1 without FLT3 internal tandem duplication [FLT3-ITD]), TET2-mutated patients had shorter event-free survival (EFS; P < .001) because of a lower complete remission (CR) rate (P = .007), and shorter disease-free survival (DFS; P = .003), and also had shorter overall survival (P = .001) compared with TET2-wt patients. TET2 mutations were not associated with outcomes in the ELN intermediate-I-risk group (CN-AML with wild-type CEBPA and wild-type NPM1 and/or FLT3-ITD). In multivariable models, TET2 mutations were associated with shorter EFS (P = .004), lower CR rate (P = .03), and shorter DFS (P = .05) only among favorable-risk CN-AML patients. We identified a TET2 mutation-associated gene-expression signature in favorable-risk but not in intermediate-I-risk patients and found distinct mutation-associated microRNA signatures in both ELN groups. TET2 mutations improve the ELN molecular-risk classification in primary CN-AML because of their adverse prognostic impact in an otherwise favorable-risk patient subset. Our data suggest that these patients may be candidates for alternative therapies.",cancer
48,Combined BRAF and MEK inhibition in melanoma with BRAF V600 mutations.,"Resistance to therapy with BRAF kinase inhibitors is associated with reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. To address this problem, we conducted a phase 1 and 2 trial of combined treatment with dabrafenib, a selective BRAF inhibitor, and trametinib, a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor. In this open-label study involving 247 patients with metastatic melanoma and BRAF V600 mutations, we evaluated the pharmacokinetic activity and safety of oral dabrafenib (75 or 150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (1, 1.5, or 2 mg daily) in 85 patients and then randomly assigned 162 patients to receive combination therapy with dabrafenib (150 mg) plus trametinib (1 or 2 mg) or dabrafenib monotherapy. The primary end points were the incidence of cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma, survival free of melanoma progression, and response. Secondary end points were overall survival and pharmacokinetic activity. Dose-limiting toxic effects were infrequently observed in patients receiving combination therapy with 150 mg of dabrafenib and 2 mg of trametinib (combination 150/2). Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma was seen in 7% of patients receiving combination 150/2 and in 19% receiving monotherapy (P=0.09), whereas pyrexia was more common in the combination 150/2 group than in the monotherapy group (71% vs. 26%). Median progression-free survival in the combination 150/2 group was 9.4 months, as compared with 5.8 months in the monotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.62; P<0.001). The rate of complete or partial response with combination 150/2 therapy was 76%, as compared with 54% with monotherapy (P=0.03). Dabrafenib and trametinib were safely combined at full monotherapy doses. The rate of pyrexia was increased with combination therapy, whereas the rate of proliferative skin lesions was nonsignificantly reduced. Progression-free survival was significantly improved.

72,Targeting levels or oligomerization of nucleophosmin 1 induces differentiation and loss of survival of human AML cells with mutant NPM1.,"Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) is an oligomeric, nucleolar phosphoprotein that functions as a molecular chaperone for both proteins and nucleic acids. NPM1 is mutated in approximately one-third of patients with AML. The mutant NPM1c+ contains a 4-base insert that results in extra C-terminal residues encoding a nuclear export signal, which causes NPM1c+ to be localized in the cytoplasm. Here, we determined the effects of targeting NPM1 in cultured and primary AML cells. Treatment with siRNA to NPM1 induced p53 and p21, decreased the percentage of cells in S-phase of the cell cycle, as well as induced differentiation of the AML OCI-AML3 cells that express both NPMc+ and unmutated NPM1. Notably, knockdown of NPM1 by shRNA abolished lethal AML phenotype induced by OCI-AML3 cells in NOD/SCID mice. Knockdown of NPM1 also sensitized OCI-AML3 to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and cytarabine. Inhibition of NPM1 oligomerization by NSC348884 induced apoptosis and sensitized OCI-AML3 and primary AML cells expressing NPM1c+ to ATRA. This effect was significantly less in AML cells coexpressing FLT3-ITD, or in AML or normal CD34+ progenitor cells expressing wild-type NPM1. Thus, attenuating levels or oligomerization of NPM1 selectively induces apoptosis and sensitizes NPM1c+ expressing AML cells to treatment with ATRA and cytarabine.",cancer

99,Promoter methylation of cyclin D2 gene in gastric carcinoma.,"Methylation of CpG island in the promoter has been recognized as an important mechanism for regulation of gene expression. Although considerable work has been done on the epigenetic control of tumor suppressor genes, little is known about the potential role of promoter CpG demethylation in the activation of oncogenes. The cyclin D2 gene is overexpressed in a subset of gastric carcinoma. To determine whether hypomethylation of cyclin D2 is involved in stomach carcinogenesis, we studied methylation of CpG islands in the cyclin D2 gene by methylation-specific PCR in 34 gastric carcinoma specimens, 21 corresponding non-neoplastic mucosae, and 8 gastric carcinoma cell lines. We also measured levels of cyclin D2 mRNA in 23 of the gastric carcinoma cases and in the gastric carcinoma cell lines. Hypomethylation of the cyclin D2 promoter was found in 24 (71%) of the 34 tumor tissues and in 6 (29%) of the 21 corresponding non-neoplastic mucosa, the incidence being significantly different (p=0.002; Fisher's exact test). Moreover, hypomethylation of cyclin D2 was more common in stage III and IV tumors than in stage I and II tumors (p=00.014; Fisher's exact test). All of three cell lines with promoter hypomethylation expressed detectable levels of cyclin D2 mRNA. Treatment of cyclin D2-negative cells lines harboring promoter hypermethylation with demethylating agent, 5-Aza-2'-deoxycytidine, led to a reactivation of cyclin D2 expression. These results suggest that DNA hypomethylation is a mechanism underlying the increased expression of cyclin D2 in cancer cells and that demethylation of cyclin D2 may be involved in development and progression of gastric carcinoma.",cancer

SOC elongates the Te-X bond and slightly reduces the vibrational frequencies. Consideration of SOC leads to better agreement with experimental values. The Møller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2) seriously underestimates the Te-X bond lengths. In contrast, B3LYP significantly overestimates them. SO-PBE0 and multireference configuration interactions with the Davidson correction (MRCI+Q), which include SOC via a state-interaction approach, give the Te-I bond length of TeI2 that matches experimental value. On the basis of the calculated thermochemical energy and optimized molecular structure, TeI4 is unlikely to be stable. The use of PBE0 including SOC is strongly recommended for predicting the molecular properties of Te-containing compounds.",nonCancer
1750,"Revisiting Neil Armstrongs Moon-Landing Quote: Implications for Speech Perception, Function Word Reduction, and Acoustic Ambiguity.","Neil Armstrong insisted that his quote upon landing on the moon was misheard, and that he had said one small step for a man, instead of one small step for man. What he said is unclear in part because function words like a can be reduced and spectrally indistinguishable from the preceding context. Therefore, their presence can be ambiguous, and they may disappear perceptually depending on the rate of surrounding speech. Two experiments are presented examining production and perception of reduced tokens of for and for a in spontaneous speech. Experiment 1 investigates the distributions of several acoustic features of for and for a. The results suggest that the distributions of for and for a overlap substantially, both in terms of temporal and spectral characteristics. Experiment 2 examines perception of these same tokens when the context speaking rate differs. The perceptibility of the function word a varies as a function of this context speaking rate. These results demonstrate that substantial ambiguity exists in the original quote from Armstrong, and that this ambiguity may be understood through context speaking rate.",nonCancer
1505,The interplay of trait worry and trait anxiety in determining episodic retrieval: the role of cognitive control.,"Worrying is a key concept in describing the complex relationship between anxiety and cognitive control. On the one hand, cognitive control processes might underlie the specific tendency to engage in worrying (i.e. trait worry), conceptualized as a future-oriented mental problem-solving activity. On the other hand, the general tendency to experience the signs and symptoms of anxiety (i.e. trait anxiety) is suggested to impair cognitive control because worrisome thoughts interfere with task-relevant processing. Based on these opposing tendencies, we predicted that the effect of the two related constructs, trait anxiety and trait worry, might cancel out one another. In statistics, such instances have been termed suppressor situations. In four experiments, we found evidence for such a suppressor situation: when their shared variance was controlled, trait worry was positively whereas trait anxiety was negatively related to performance in a memory task requiring strategic, effortful retrieval. We also showed that these opposing effects are related to temporal context reinstatement. Our results suggest that trait worry and trait anxiety possess unique sources of variance which differently relate to performance in memory tasks requiring cognitive control.",nonCancer

2424,Breast cancer cells evade paclitaxel-induced cell death by developing resistance to dasatinib.,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), which does not express the progesterone, estrogen, or HER2/neu receptor, is aggressive and difficult to treat. Paclitaxel, a tubulin stabilizing agent, is one of the most frequently prescribed anticancer agents for breast cancers, including TNBC. Residual disease that occurs due to resistance or partial resistance of cancer cells in a tumor against anticancer agents is the most important issue in oncology. In the present study, when MDA-MB-231 cells, a TNBC cell line, were treated with 30 µM paclitaxel, a slightly higher concentration than its GI50 value, for 6 days, a small number of cells with different morphologies survived. Among the surviving cells, small round cells were isolated, cloned, and named MDA-MB-231-JYJ cells. MDA-MB-231-JYJ cells were observed to be highly proliferative and tumorigenic. In addition, signal transduction molecules involved in proliferation, survival, malignancy, or stemness of cancer cells, such as c-Src, c-Met, Notch 1, c-Myc, Sox2, Oct3/4, Nanog, and E-cadherin were highly expressed or activated. While further study is required, MDA-MB-231-JYJ cells appear to have some of the characteristics of cancer precursor cells. Although MDA-MB-231-JYJ cells were isolated from the cells that survived in the continuous presence of paclitaxel, they were not resistant to paclitaxel but developed resistance to dasatinib, a Bcr-Abl and Src kinase family inhibitor. The activated state of Src and Notch 1, and the expression levels of c-Myc and cyclins in MDA-MB-231-JYJ cells were less affected than MDA-MB-231 cells by the treatment of dasatinib, which may explain the resistance of MDA-MB-231-JYJ cells to dasatinib. These results suggest that cancer cells that become resistant to dasatinib during the process of paclitaxel therapy in patients may appear, and caution is required in the design of clinical trials using these two agents.",nonCancer
84,Age-related risk profile and chemotherapy dose response in acute myeloid leukemia: a study by the German Acute Myeloid Leukemia Cooperative Group.,"The purpose of the study was to assess the contribution of age and disease variables to the outcome of untreated patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) receiving varying intensive induction chemotherapy. Patients 16 to 85 years of age with primary AML, known karyotype, and uniform postremission chemotherapy enrolled onto two consecutive trials were eligible and were randomly assigned to induction either with a standard-dose (cytarabine, daunorubicin, and 6-thioguanine) and a high-dose (cytarabine and mitoxantrone) combination, or with two courses of the high-dose combination. Subgroups were defined by karyotype, nucleophosmin and FLT3 mutation, WBC count, serum lactate dehydrogenase, and residual blasts. In 1,284 patients, the overall survival at 4 years in those younger and older than 60 years was 37% versus 16% (P < .001) and the ongoing remission duration was 46% versus 22% (P < .001). Similar age-related differences in outcome were found for all defined subgroups. No difference in outcome according to randomly assigned treatment regimen was observed in any age group or prognostic subset. Regarding prognostic subgroups, molecular factors were also considered. Under harmonized conditions, older and younger patients with AML show modest differences in their risk profiles and equally no dose response to intensified chemotherapy. Their observed fundamental difference in outcome across all subgroups remains unexplained. Further molecular investigation may elucidate the age effect in AML and identify new targets.",cancer
458,AGR2 predicts tamoxifen resistance in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,"Endocrine resistance is a significant problem in breast cancer treatment. Thus identification and validation of novel resistance determinants is important to improve treatment efficacy and patient outcome. In our work, AGR2 expression was determined by qRT-PCR in Tru-Cut needle biopsies from tamoxifen-treated postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Our results showed inversed association of AGR2 mRNA levels with primary treatment response (P = 0.0011) and progression-free survival (P = 0.0366) in 61 ER-positive breast carcinomas. As shown by our experimental and clinical evaluations, elevated AGR2 expression predicts decreased efficacy of tamoxifen treatment. From this perspective, AGR2 is a potential predictive biomarker enabling selection of an optimal algorithm for adjuvant hormonal therapy in postmenopausal ER-positive breast cancer patients.",cancer
2356,A HapMap leads to a Capsicum annuum SNP infinium array: a new tool for pepper breeding.,"The Capsicum genus (Pepper) is a part of the Solanacae family. It has been important in many cultures worldwide for its key nutritional components and uses as spices, medicines, ornamentals and vegetables. Worldwide population growth is associated with demand for more nutritionally valuable vegetables while contending with decreasing resources and available land. These conditions require increased efficiency in pepper breeding to deal with these imminent challenges. Through resequencing of inbred lines we have completed a valuable haplotype map (HapMap) for the pepper genome based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). The identified SNPs were annotated and classified based on their gene annotation in the pepper draft genome sequence and phenotype of the sequenced inbred lines. A selection of one marker per gene model was utilized to create the PepperSNP16K array, which simultaneously genotyped 16 405 SNPs, of which 90.7% were found to be informative. A set of 84 inbred and hybrid lines and a mapping population of 90 interspecific F2 individuals were utilized to validate the array. Diversity analysis of the inbred lines shows a distinct separation of bell versus chile/hot pepper types and separates them into five distinct germplasm groups. The interspecific population created between Tabasco (C. frutescens chile type) and P4 (C. annuum blocky type) produced a linkage map with 5546 markers separated into 1361 bins on twelve 12 linkage groups representing 1392.3 cM. This publically available genotyping platform can be used to rapidly assess a large number of markers in a reproducible high-throughput manner for pepper. As a standardized tool for genetic analyses, the PepperSNP16K can be used worldwide to share findings and analyze QTLs for important traits leading to continued improvement of pepper for consumers. Data and information on the array are available through the Solanaceae Genomics Network.",nonCancer
236,"Benefit from adjuvant tamoxifen therapy in primary breast cancer patients according oestrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, EGF receptor and HER2 status.","Most women with oestrogen receptor (ER) positive primary breast cancer receive adjuvant tamoxifen after surgery. The measurement of tumour biomarkers should allow better selection of patients for such treatment or for therapies such as aromatase inhibitors. Histopathological blocks of primary breast cancer patients who had been randomized to receive 2-years tamoxifen or no adjuvant therapy in two mature randomised clinical trials were retrieved. Immunohistochemical staining for ER, progesterone receptor (PgR), HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was undertaken. The primary endpoint was relapse free survival. 813 patients were included in the study. Benefit from tamoxifen was seen in ER-positive patients [Relative risk (rr) 0.77, ci 0.63-0.93]. ER-negative patients also showed a strong trend to benefit from tamoxifen (rr 0.73, ci 0.52-1.02) which was largely confined to the PgR-positive group. Amongst the ER-positive group, PgR-positive and PgR-negative patients showed similar benefit (rr 0.81; ci 0.65-1.02 and 0.70; ci 0.49-0.99, respectively). Patients positive for HER2 did not benefit significantly (rr 1.14; ci 0.75-1.73) but this group was small. Measurement of PgR status in ER-negative patients defines a group of patients that benefit from tamoxifen but would be excluded from tamoxifen therapy on the basis of ER status alone. The data are consistent with HER2 positive tumours being resistant to tamoxifen.",cancer
1423,"Mpn491, a secreted nuclease of Mycoplasma pneumoniae plays a critical role in evading killing by neutrophil extracellular traps.","Neutrophils play an important role in antimicrobial defense as the first line of innate immune system. Recently, release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) has been identified as a killing mechanism of neutrophils against invading microbes. Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a causative agent of respiratory infection, has been shown to be resistant to in vitro killing by neutrophils, suggesting that the bacterium might circumvent bactericidal activity of NETs. In this study, we investigated whether M. pneumoniae possesses resistance mechanisms against the NETs-mediated killing of neutrophils, and found that the bacterium degrades the NETs induced upon M. pneumoniae infection. The NETs-degrading ability of M. pneumoniae required the production of a secreted nuclease, Mpn491, capable of using Mg(2+) as a cofactor for its hydrolytic activity. Moreover, the inactivation of the nuclease resulted in increased susceptibility of M. pneumoniae to the NETs-mediated killing of neutrophils. The results suggest that M. pneumoniae employs Mpn491 as a means for evading the killing mechanism of neutrophils. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer

1249,Targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 for Treatment of Soft-Tissue Sarcoma.,"Purpose: Altered FGFR1 signaling has emerged as a therapeutic target in epithelial malignancies. In contrast, the role of FGFR1 in soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) has not been established. Prompted by the detection and subsequent therapeutic inhibition of amplified FGFR1 in a patient with metastatic leiomyosarcoma, we investigated the oncogenic properties of FGFR1 and its potential as a drug target in patients with STS.Experimental Design: The frequency of FGFR1 amplification and overexpression, as assessed by FISH, microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization and mRNA expression profiling, SNP array profiling, and RNA sequencing, was determined in three patient cohorts. The sensitivity of STS cell lines with or without FGFR1 alterations to genetic and pharmacologic FGFR1 inhibition and the signaling pathways engaged by FGFR1 were investigated using viability assays, colony formation assays, and biochemical analysis.Results: Increased FGFR1 copy number was detected in 74 of 190 (38.9%; cohort 1), 13 of 79 (16.5%; cohort 2), and 80 of 254 (31.5%; cohort 3) patients. FGFR1 overexpression occurred in 16 of 79 (20.2%, cohort 2) and 39 of 254 (15.4%; cohort 3) patients. Targeting of FGFR1 by RNA interference and small-molecule inhibitors (PD173074, AZD4547, BGJ398) revealed that the requirement for FGFR1 signaling in STS cells is dictated by FGFR1 expression levels, and identified the MAPK-ERK1/2 axis as critical FGFR1 effector pathway.Conclusions: These data identify FGFR1 as a driver gene in multiple STS subtypes and support FGFR1 inhibition, guided by patient selection according to the FGFR1 expression and monitoring of MAPK-ERK1/2 signaling, as a therapeutic option in this challenging group of diseases.

2383,A new paradigm of DNA synthesis: three-metal-ion catalysis.,"Enzyme catalysis has been studied for over a century. How it actually occurs has not been visualized until recently. By combining in crystallo reaction and X-ray diffraction analysis of reaction intermediates, we have obtained unprecedented atomic details of the DNA synthesis process. Contrary to the established theory that enzyme-substrate complexes and transition states have identical atomic composition and catalysis occurs by the two-metal-ion mechanism, we have discovered that an additional divalent cation has to be captured en route to product formation. Unlike the canonical two metal ions, which are coordinated by DNA polymerases, this third metal ion is free of enzyme coordination. Its location between the α- and β-phosphates of dNTP suggests that the third metal ion may drive the phosphoryltransfer from the leaving group opposite to the 3'-OH nucleophile. Experimental data indicate that binding of the third metal ion may be the rate-limiting step in DNA synthesis and the free energy associated with the metal-ion binding can overcome the activation barrier to the DNA synthesis reaction.",nonCancer
1264,Acquired Resistance to the TRK Inhibitor Entrectinib in Colorectal Cancer.,"Entrectinib is a first-in-class pan-TRK kinase inhibitor currently undergoing clinical testing in colorectal cancer and other tumor types. A patient with metastatic colorectal cancer harboring an LMNA-NTRK1 rearrangement displayed a remarkable response to treatment with entrectinib, which was followed by the emergence of resistance. To characterize the molecular bases of the patient's relapse, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) was collected longitudinally during treatment, and a tissue biopsy, obtained before entrectinib treatment, was transplanted in mice (xenopatient), which then received the same entrectinib regimen until resistance developed. Genetic profiling of ctDNA and xenopatient samples showed acquisition of two point mutations in the catalytic domain of NTRK1, p.G595R and p.G667C. Biochemical and pharmacologic analysis in multiple preclinical models confirmed that either mutation renders the TRKA kinase insensitive to entrectinib. These findings can be immediately exploited to design next-generation TRKA inhibitors. We provide proof of principle that analyses of xenopatients (avatar) and liquid biopsies allow the identification of drug resistance mechanisms in parallel with clinical treatment of an individual patient. We describe for the first time that p.G595R and p.G667C TRKA mutations drive acquired resistance to entrectinib in colorectal cancers carrying NTRK1 rearrangements.",cancer
79,IDH1 mutations are detected in 6.6% of 1414 AML patients and are associated with intermediate risk karyotype and unfavorable prognosis in adults younger than 60 years and unmutated NPM1 status.,"Mutations in the IDH1 gene at position R132 coding for the enzyme cytosolic isocitrate dehydrogenase are known in glioma and have recently been detected also in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). These mutations result in an accumulation of α-ketoglutarate to R (2)-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG). To further clarify the role of this mutation in AML, we have analyzed IDH1R132 in 1414 AML patients. We detected IDH1R132 mutations in 93 of 1414 patients (6.6%) with a clear prevalence in intermediate risk karyotype group (10.4%, P < .001). Although IDH1R132 mutations can incidentally occur together with all other molecular markers, there were strong associations with NPM1 mutations (14.2% vs 5.4% in NPM1wt, P < .001) and MLL-PTD (18.2% vs 7.0% in MLLwt, P = .020). IDH1-mutated cases more often had AML without maturation/French-American-British M1 (P < .001), an immature immunophenotype, and female sex (8.7% vs 4.7% in male, P = .003) compared with IDH1wt cases. Prognosis was adversely affected by IDH1 mutations with trend for shorter overall survival (P = .110), a shorter event-free survival (P < .003) and a higher cumulative risk for relapse (P = .001). IDH1 mutations were of independent prognostic relevance for event-free survival (P = .039) especially in the age group < 60 years (P = .028). In conclusion, these data show that IDH1R132 may significantly add information regarding characterization and prognostication in AML.",cancer

1163,The association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation with prognostic factors and poor clinical outcome in papillary thyroid cancer: a meta-analysis.,"The effects of the BRAF(V600E) mutation on prognostic factors and poor clinical outcomes in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) have not been fully quantified. The authors performed comprehensive meta-analysis to assess the strength of associations between these conditions and the BRAF(V600E) mutation. The authors identified the clinical studies that examined the association of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in surgical specimens with clinicopathologic outcomes between January 2003 and October 2010 using the Medline database. One hundred thirty-one relevant studies were hand-searched. The authors selected 27 studies that included 5655 PTC patients. They calculated the pooled odds ratios (ORs) or risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study using a random effect model. The average prevalence rate of the BRAF(V600E) mutation was 49.4%. In 26 studies, compared with the patients who had the wild-type BRAF genes, the PTC patients with the BRAF(V600E) mutation had increased ORs of an extrathyroidal invasion (OR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.68-2.73), a lymph node metastasis (OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.21-1.97), and an advanced TNM stage (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.61-2.49). In 8 studies, patients with the mutation had 2.14-fold increased risk of recurrent and persistent disease (95% CI, 1.67-2.74). The associations were generally consistent across the different study populations. This meta-analysis demonstrates that the BRAF(V600E) mutation is closely related to the high-risk clinicopathological factors and poorer outcome of PTC. The results obtained here suggest that the BRAF(V600E) mutation should be considered as a poor prognostic marker in PTC and may lead to better management for individual patients.",cancer
1254,2-Hydroxyglutarate produced by neomorphic IDH mutations suppresses homologous recombination and induces PARP inhibitor sensitivity.,"2-Hydroxyglutarate (2HG) exists as two enantiomers, (R)-2HG and (S)-2HG, and both are implicated in tumor progression via their inhibitory effects on α-ketoglutarate (αKG)-dependent dioxygenases. The former is an oncometabolite that is induced by the neomorphic activity conferred by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and IDH2 mutations, whereas the latter is produced under pathologic processes such as hypoxia. We report that IDH1/2 mutations induce a homologous recombination (HR) defect that renders tumor cells exquisitely sensitive to poly(adenosine 5'-diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. This ""BRCAness"" phenotype of IDH mutant cells can be completely reversed by treatment with small-molecule inhibitors of the mutant IDH1 enzyme, and conversely, it can be entirely recapitulated by treatment with either of the 2HG enantiomers in cells with intact IDH1/2 proteins. We demonstrate mutant IDH1-dependent PARP inhibitor sensitivity in a range of clinically relevant models, including primary patient-derived glioma cells in culture and genetically matched tumor xenografts in vivo. These findings provide the basis for a possible therapeutic strategy exploiting the biological consequences of mutant IDH, rather than attempting to block 2HG production, by targeting the 2HG-dependent HR deficiency with PARP inhibition. Furthermore, our results uncover an unexpected link between oncometabolites, altered DNA repair, and genetic instability.",cancer
1649,The hemostatic disturbance in patients with acute aortic dissection: A prospective observational study.,"Coagulopathy is still a frequent complication in the surgical treatment of acute aortic dissection. However, the physiopathology of surgically induced coagulopathy has never been systematically and comprehensively studied in patients with acute aortic dissection. The aim of the present study was to describe the perioperative hemostatic system in patients with acute aortic dissection.The 87 patients who underwent aortic arch surgery for acute Stanford type A aortic dissection from January 2013 to September 2015 were enrolled in this study. The perioperative biomarkers of hemostatic system were evaluated using standard laboratory tests and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) at 5 time points: anesthesia induction (T1), lowest nasopharyngeal temperature (T2), protamine reversal (T3), 4 hours after surgery (T4), and 24 hours after surgery (T5).The ELISAs biomarkers revealed activation of coagulation (thrombin-antithrombin III complex [TAT] and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 [F1 + 2] were elevated), suppression of anticoagulation (antithrombin III [AT III] levels were depressed), and activation of fibrinolysis (plasminogen was decreased and plasmin-antiplasmin complex [PAP] was elevated). The standard laboratory tests also demonstrated that surgery resulted in a significant reduction in platelet counts and fibrinogen concentration.Systemic activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis, and inhibition of anticoagulation were observed during the perioperative period in patients with acute aortic dissection. Indeed, these patients exhibited consumption coagulopathy and procoagulant state perioperatively. Therefore, we believe that this remarkable disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)-like coagulopathy has a high risk of bleeding and may influence postoperative outcome of patients with acute aortic dissection.",nonCancer

MSCs were isolated from human umbilical cord and cultured with collagenase digestion. Cell surface markers were detected and fifth generation UC-MSCs were labeled with PKH26. The partially hepatectomized model rats were injected with the labeled human umbilical cord MSCs and transplanted through the portal vein. The survival of the labeled cells, in differentiation conditions and the expression of hepatic marker albumin were observed at post-transplantation 1, 2 and 3 weeks under a fluorescence microscope. It was found that the human umbilical cord MSCs could be cultured and amplified in vitro. Following transplantation to the partially hepatectomized liver of the model rat, the cells survived and expresses the hepatic marker albumin in vivo. After being labeled with PKH26, the cells were visualized as red fluorescence under a fluorescence microscope. In the frozen sections of the liver, the marked cells scattered around and most of them expressed albumin with green fluorescence under the fluorescence microscope. In conclusion, the transplanted human umbilical cord MSCs survived and differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells. The human umbilical cord MSCs may therefore be a main source of hepatocytes in transplantation.",nonCancer
716,Promising response of anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive large B-cell lymphoma to crizotinib salvage treatment: case report and review of literature.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (ALK + DLBCL) is a rare and poorly characterized subtype of lymphoma. Reports suggest that this type of tumor responds poorly to standard regimens for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, with rituximab playing no therapeutic role due to the absence of CD20 expression. In view of the expression of ALK in this disease, it is plausible that the ALK inhibitor crizotinib may be an effective treatment. We report a case of a 21-year-old male ALK + DLBCL patient. He initially received five cycles of CHOP-21 (vincristine, pirarubicin, cyclophosphamide and prednisone) and achieved a partial remission (PR) but soon deteriorated. He was subsequently treated with five courses of the salvage chemotherapy regimen ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) and achieved PR again. He refused to accept an autologous stem-cell transplantation, after which the disease progressed rapidly. We administered two courses of an alternative salvage chemotherapy regimen containing GEMOX and dexamethasone with the addition of the ALK inhibitor crizotinib. His symptoms alleviated for a short time but soon worsened and the patient died of massive progressive disease.",cancer
109,The two major imatinib resistance mutations E255K and T315I enhance the activity of BCR/ABL fusion kinase.,"The resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in BCR/ABL-positive leukemias is mostly associated with mutations in the kinase domain of BCR/ABL, which include the most prevalent mutations E255K and T315I. Intriguingly, these mutations have also been identified in some patients before imatinib treatment. Here we examined the effects of these mutations on the kinase activity of a BCR/ABL kinase domain construct that also contained the SH3 and SH2 domains. When expressed in COS7 cells, the BCR/ABL construct with either E255K or T315I exhibited not only the resistance to imatinib but also the increase in activity to induce autophosphorylation as well as tyrosine phosphorylation of various cellular proteins, which included STAT5. The mutant kinases also showed increased activities in in vitro kinase assays. These results raise a possibility that the major imatinib resistance mutations E255K and T315I may confer the growth advantage on leukemic cells to expand in the absence of selective pressure from imatinib treatment.",cancer
597,Impact of SYT-SSX fusion type on the clinical behavior of synovial sarcoma: a multi-institutional retrospective study of 243 patients.,"Synovial sarcomas are aggressive spindle cell sarcomas containing in some cases areas of epithelial differentiation. They consistently show a specific t(X;18;p11;q11), which usually represents either of two gene fusions, SYT-SSX1 or SYT-SSX2, encoding putative transcriptional proteins differing at 13 amino acid positions. Previous studies have suggested that patients with SYT-SSX2 tumors do better than those with SYT-SSX1 tumors, but the study groups were too limited to be conclusive. To address this issue more definitively, we collected data on SYT-SSX fusion type, pathology, and clinical course in a retrospective multi-institutional study of 243 patients (age range, 6-82) with synovial sarcoma. SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 fusions were detected in 147 tumors (61%) and 91 tumors (37%), respectively. Histologically, 61 (25%) were classified as biphasic type and 180 (74%) as monophasic type based on the presence or absence of areas of glandular epithelial differentiation, respectively. Median and 5-year overall survivals for the SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2 groups were 6.1 years and 53%, and 13.7 years and 73%, respectively. Overall survival was significantly better among SYT-SSX2 cases (P = 0.03), among cases localized at diagnosis (P < 0.0001), and among patients with primary tumors < 5 cm in greatest dimension (P = 0.01). Age, sex, histological type, and axial versus peripheral primary site had no impact on overall survival. The impact of fusion type on survival remained significant when stratified for primary tumor size (P = 0.03) but was no longer significant when stratified for disease status at presentation. This may reflect the tendency for patients with SYT-SSX1 tumors to present more often with metastatic disease (P = 0.05). Cox regression identified disease status (P < 0.0001) and primary tumor size (P = 0.04) as the only factors independently predictive of overall survival in the subset of 160 patients with information on all of the factors. Within the subset of patients with localized disease at diagnosis (n = 202), the median and 5-year survival for the SYT-SSX1 and the SYT-SSX2 groups were 9.2 years and 61% versus 13.7 years and 77%, respectively. Patients whose tumors contained the SYT-SSX2 fusion (P = 0.08) or were smaller (P = 0.12) showed a trend toward better survival by log-rank test, whereas tumor histology had no impact (P = 0.8). In a Cox regression analysis considering all of the factors, SYT-SSX fusion type emerged as the only independent significant factor (P = 0.04) for overall survival within the subset of 133 patients with localized disease at diagnosis who had information on all of the factors. Among other comparisons, there was a strong association of fusion type and morphology (P < 0.001), with almost all of the SYT-SSX2 tumors showing absence of glandular differentiation (monophasic histology) and almost all of the biphasic tumors containing SYT-SSX1. There was also a statistically significant association of fusion type and patient sex (P = 0.03); specifically, the male:female ratio of SYT-SSX1 cases was 1:1, whereas for SYT-SSX2 cases, it was close to 1:2. Overall, SYT-SSX fusion type appears to be the single most significant prognostic factor by multivariate analysis in patients with localized disease at diagnosis. SYT-SSX fusion type also appears to exert part of its impact on prognosis before presentation through its association with stage at diagnosis. In addition, the associations of SYT-SSX fusion type with patient sex and tumor epithelial differentiation point to interesting mechanistic biological differences.",cancer
543,K-ras mutations and benefit from cetuximab in advanced colorectal cancer.,"Treatment with cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor, improves overall and progression-free survival and preserves the quality of life in patients with colorectal cancer that has not responded to chemotherapy. The mutation status of the K-ras gene in the tumor may affect the response to cetuximab and have treatment-independent prognostic value. We analyzed tumor samples, obtained from 394 of 572 patients (68.9%) with colorectal cancer who were randomly assigned to receive cetuximab plus best supportive care or best supportive care alone, to look for activating mutations in exon 2 of the K-ras gene. We assessed whether the mutation status of the K-ras gene was associated with survival in the cetuximab and supportive-care groups. Of the tumors evaluated for K-ras mutations, 42.3% had at least one mutation in exon 2 of the gene. The effectiveness of cetuximab was significantly associated with K-ras mutation status (P=0.01 and P<0.001 for the interaction of K-ras mutation status with overall survival and progression-free survival, respectively). In patients with wild-type K-ras tumors, treatment with cetuximab as compared with supportive care alone significantly improved overall survival (median, 9.5 vs. 4.8 months; hazard ratio for death, 0.55; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41 to 0.74; P<0.001) and progression-free survival (median, 3.7 months vs. 1.9 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.54; P<0.001). Among patients with mutated K-ras tumors, there was no significant difference between those who were treated with cetuximab and those who received supportive care alone with respect to overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.98; P=0.89) or progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; P=0.96). In the group of patients receiving best supportive care alone, the mutation status of the K-ras gene was not significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 1.01; P=0.97). Patients with a colorectal tumor bearing mutated K-ras did not benefit from cetuximab, whereas patients with a tumor bearing wild-type K-ras did benefit from cetuximab. The mutation status of the K-ras gene had no influence on survival among patients treated with best supportive care alone. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00079066.)",cancer
363,Association of Human Papillomavirus and p16 Status With Outcomes in the IMCL-9815 Phase III Registration Trial for Patients With Locoregionally Advanced Oropharyngeal Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Head and Neck Treated With Radiotherapy With or Without Cetuximab.,"We conducted a retrospective evaluation of the IMCL-9815 study to examine the association of human papillomavirus (HPV) and p16 protein expression status with outcomes in patients with oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) receiving radiotherapy (RT) plus cetuximab or RT alone. In the IMCL-9815 study, patients were randomly allocated to receive RT plus weekly cetuximab or RT alone. A subpopulation of patients with p16-evaluable OPC was retrospectively evaluated on the basis of locoregional control (LRC), overall survival (OS), and progression-free survival (PFS). Evaluable samples from patients with p16-positive OPC were also tested for HPV DNA. Tumor p16 status was evaluable in 182 patients with OPC enrolled in the IMCL-9815 study; 41% were p16 positive. When treated with RT alone or RT plus cetuximab, p16-positive patients had a longer OS than p16-negative patients (hazard ratio, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.74 and hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.07 to 0.36, respectively). The addition of cetuximab to RT increased LRC, OS, and PFS in both patients with p16-positive OPC and those with p16-negative disease. Interaction tests for LRC, OS, and PFS did not demonstrate any significant interaction between p16 status and treatment effect (P = .087, .085, and .253, respectively). Similar trends were observed when patients with p16-positive/HPV-positive OPC (n = 49) and those with p16-positive/HPV-negative OPC (n = 14) were compared. p16 status was strongly prognostic for patients with OPC. The data suggest that the addition of cetuximab to RT improved clinical outcomes regardless of p16 or HPV status versus RT alone.",cancer
1025,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 tyrosine kinase fusions define a unique molecular subtype of cholangiocarcinoma.,"Cholangiocarcinoma is an intractable cancer, with limited therapeutic options, in which the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor development remain poorly understood. Identification of a novel driver oncogene and applying it to targeted therapies for molecularly defined cancers might lead to improvements in the outcome of patients. We performed massively parallel whole transcriptome sequencing in eight specimens from cholangiocarcinoma patients without KRAS/BRAF/ROS1 alterations and identified two fusion kinase genes, FGFR2-AHCYL1 and FGFR2-BICC1. In reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) screening, the FGFR2 fusion was detected in nine patients with cholangiocarcinoma (9/102), exclusively in the intrahepatic subtype (9/66, 13.6%), rarely in colorectal (1/149) and hepatocellular carcinoma (1/96), and none in gastric cancer (0/212). The rearrangements were mutually exclusive with KRAS/BRAF mutations. Expression of the fusion kinases in NIH3T3 cells activated MAPK and conferred anchorage-independent growth and in vivo tumorigenesis of subcutaneous transplanted cells in immune-compromised mice. This transforming ability was attributable to its kinase activity. Treatment with the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) kinase inhibitors BGJ398 and PD173074 effectively suppressed transformation. FGFR2 fusions occur in 13.6% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The expression pattern of these fusions in association with sensitivity to FGFR inhibitors warrant a new molecular classification of cholangiocarcinoma and suggest a new therapeutic approach to the disease.",cancer
1823,"Hydrogen Bonding of 1,2-Azaborines in the Binding Cavity of T4 Lysozyme Mutants: Structures and Thermodynamics.","Protein crystallography and calorimetry were used to characterize the binding of 1,2-azaborines to model cavities in T4 lyso- zyme in direct comparison to their carbonaceous counterparts. In the apolar L99A cavity, affinity for Ab dropped only slightly versus benzene. In the cavity designed to accommodate a single hydrogen bond (L99A/M102Q), Gln102=O...H-N hydrogen bonding for Ab and BEtAb was observed in the crystallographic complexes. The strength of the hydrogen bonding was estimated as 0.94 and 0.64 kcal/mol for Ab and BEtAb, respectively. This work unambiguously demonstrates that 1,2-azaborines can be readily accommodated in classic aryl recog- nition pockets and establishes one of 1,2-azaborine's distinguishing features from its carbonaceous isostere benzene - its ability to serve as an NH hydrogen bond donor in a biological setting.",nonCancer
1904,2016 Arte Poster Competition First Place Winner: Circadian Rhythm and UV-Induced Skin Damage: An In Vivo Study.,"Exposure of the skin to ultraviolet (UV) irradiation causes many detrimental effects through mechanisms related to oxidative stress and DNA damage. Excessive oxidative stress can cause apoptosis and cellular dysfunction of epidermal cells leading to cellular senescence and connective tissue degradation. Direct and indirect damage to DNA predisposes the skin to cancer formation. Chronic UV exposure also leads to skin aging manifested as wrinkling, loss of skin tone, and decreased resilience. Fortunately, human skin has several natural mechanisms for combating UV-induced damage. The mechanisms operate on a diurnal rhythm, a cycle that repeats approximately every 24 hours. It is known that the circadian rhythm is involved in many skin physiologic processes, including water regulation and epidermal stem cell function. This study evaluated whether UV damage and the skin's natural mechanisms of inflammation and repair are also affected by circadian rhythm. We looked at UV-induced erythema on seven human subjects irradiated with simulated solar radiation in the morning (at 08:00 h) versus in the afternoon (at 16:00 h). Our data suggest that the same dose of UV radiation induces significantly more inflammation in the morning than in the afternoon. Changes in protein expression relevant to DNA damage, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, complementation group A (XPA), and cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) from skin biopsies correlated with our clinical results. Both XPA and CPD levels were higher after the morning UV exposure compared with the afternoon exposure. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1124-1130.",nonCancer

Little is known about the sensitivity of subtypes of HER2 mutant lung cancers to targeted agents. We present a patient with HER2 mutant lung cancer with a 12 base pair insertion YVMA (p.A775_G776insYVMA), who had a long natural history and durable partial response to afatinib.

2488,Association between ABCB1 genetic polymorphism and the effect on epilepsy following phenytoin treatment.,"The aim of the study was to analyze the effect of ABCB1 genetic polymorphisms on the efficacy of phenytoin (PHT) treatment in epilepsy patients. In total, 200 epilepsy patients who were administered PHT were divided into the responsive and pharmaco-resistance groups depending on the clinical data of PHT treatment in epilepsy patients. The serum concentration of PHT was detected by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). ABCB1 polymorphisms were analyzed by the polymerase chain reaction restriction-fragment length polymorphism method. The C1236T, C3435T and G2677T/A haplotypes were reconstructed for the ABCB1 gene using SHEsis programs. One-way analysis of variance was used for data analysis. In ABCB1 C1236T, the rate of the CC genotype in pharmaco-resistance (17.5%) was higher than that of the responsive group (2.1%), while the rate of the TT genotype in pharmaco-resistance (41.6%) was lower than that of the responsive group (55.4%) (P<0.05). In ABCB1 G2677T/A, the rate of the GG genotype in pharmaco-resistance (29.6%) was higher than that of the responsive group (9.7%), while the rate of the TT genotype in pharmaco-resistance (4.6%) was lower than that of the responsive group (30.4%) (P<0.05). The rate of the TTC haploid in pharmaco-resistance (24.1%) was higher than that of the responsive group (8.8%) (P<0.05). The PHT serum concentration had no statistical significance in the patients with different genotypes. In conclusion, there was no association between ABCB1 genetic polymorphism and PHT serum concentration, although the polymorphisms affected the efficacy of PHT treatment in patients with epilepsy.",nonCancer
764,Response of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cells carrying PIK3CA mutations to selected targeted therapies.,"The PIK3CA mutation is one of the most common mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Through this research we attempt to elicit the role of oncogene dependence and effects of targeted therapy on this PIK3CA mutation. (1) To determine the role of oncogene dependence on PIK3CA-one of the more common and targetable oncogenes in HNSCC, and (2) to evaluate the consequence of this oncogene on the effectiveness of newly developed targeted therapies. This was a cell culture-based, in vitro study performed at an academic research laboratory assessing the viability of PIK3CA-mutated head and neck cell lines when treated with targeted therapy. PIK3CA-mutated head and neck cell lines were treated with 17-AAG, GDC-0941, trametinib, and BEZ-235. Assessment of cell viability of HNSCC cell lines characterized for PIK3CA mutations or SCC25 cells engineered to express the PIK3CA hotspot mutations E545K or H1047R. Surprisingly, in engineered cell lines, the hotspot E545K and H1047R mutations conferred increased, rather than reduced, IC50 assay measurements when treated with the respective HSP90, PI3K, and MEK inhibitors, 17-AAG, GDC-0941, and trametinib, compared with the SCC25 control cell lines. When treated with BEZ-235, H1047R-expressing cell lines showed increased sensitivity to inhibition compared with control, whereas those expressing E545K showed slightly increased sensitivity of unclear significance. (1) The PIK3CA mutations within our engineered cell model did not lead to enhanced oncogene-dependent cell death when treated with direct inhibition of the PI3K enzyme yet did show increased sensitivity compared with control with dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition. (2) Oncogene addiction to PIK3CA hotspot mutations, if it occurs, is likely to evolve in vivo in the context of additional molecular changes that remain to be identified. Additional study is required to develop new model systems and approaches to determine the role of targeted therapy in the treatment of PI3K-overactive HNSCC tumors.",cancer
335,Identification of a mutation in the extracellular domain of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor conferring cetuximab resistance in colorectal cancer.,"Antibodies against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--cetuximab and panitumumab--are widely used to treat colorectal cancer. Unfortunately, patients eventually develop resistance to these agents. We describe an acquired EGFR ectodomain mutation (S492R) that prevents cetuximab binding and confers resistance to cetuximab. Cells with this mutation, however, retain binding to and are growth inhibited by panitumumab. Two of ten subjects studied here with disease progression after cetuximab treatment acquired this mutation. A subject with cetuximab resistance harboring the S492R mutation responded to treatment with panitumumab.",cancer
1995,Immune responses to polyclonal T-cell vaccination in patients with progressive multiple sclerosis.,"The overall objective of disease management in autoimmune diseases is to suppress chronic inflammation and prevent organ damage. Therapies often revolve around five drug classes: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), anti-malarials, steroids, immunosuppressants, and bio-therapies. However, none of these is a 'cure' and each displays a potential for adverse events. In particular, while all of them suppress harmful autoimmune responses, they also impact on useful protective immune responses. T-Cell receptor (TCR) immunogenicity provides a rationale for T-cell vaccinations to induce anti-idiotypic immune responses with the purpose of down-regulating functionality of idiotype-bearing self-reactive T-cells. To explore this, in this study, 39 patients with progressive (chronic) multiple sclerosis (MS) were multiply immunized with autological polyclonal T-cell vaccines (TCVs). None of the TCV-treated patients experienced any significant side-effects during the entire follow-up period (2 years). T-Cell vaccination had no significant effects on T-cell sub-population contents in the blood of MS patients after 2 years of immunotherapy initiation. However, a substantial reduction in the frequency of CD4(+ )and CD8(+ )memory T-cells able to produce interferon (IFN)-γ following activation were noted in the blood of TCV-treated patients. Moreover, significant and sustained reduction in plasma IFNγ levels and concomitant increases in interleukin (IL)-4 levels were documented in these samples. The TCV-treated subjects, however, exhibited no significant changes in plasma IL-17 and IL-18. More importantly was a significant decline in proliferative T-cell responses to myelin antigens in the TCV-treated patients, indicating attenuation of myelin-specific T-cell activity. Collectively, the results suggest that polyclonal T-cell vaccination is safe to use, able to induce measurable, long-lasting, anti-inflammatory immune effects in patients with advanced MS.",nonCancer
622,HPV-related methylation signature predicts survival in oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas.,"High-risk types of human papilloma virus (HPV) are increasingly associated with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Strikingly, patients with HPV-positive OPSCC are highly curable with ionizing radiation and have better survival compared with HPV-negative patients, but the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. We applied an array-based approach to monitor global changes in CpG island hypermethylation between HPV-negative and HPV-positive OPSCCs and identified a specific pattern of differentially methylated regions that critically depends on the presence of viral transcripts. HPV-related alterations were confirmed for the majority of candidate gene promoters by mass spectrometric, quantitative methylation analysis. There was a significant inverse correlation between promoter hypermethylation of ALDH1A2, OSR2, GATA4, GRIA4, and IRX4 and transcript levels. Interestingly, Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that a combined promoter methylation pattern of low methylation levels in ALDH1A2 and OSR2 promoters and high methylation levels in GATA4, GRIA4, and IRX4 promoters was significantly correlated with improved survival in 3 independent patient cohorts. ALDH1A2 protein levels, determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays, confirmed the association with clinical outcome. In summary, our study highlights specific alterations in global gene promoter methylation in HPV-driven OPSCCs and identifies a signature that predicts the clinical outcome in OPSCCs.",cancer
1166,Genetic predictors of MEK dependence in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Hyperactivated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling is common in human cancer and is often the result of activating mutations in BRAF, RAS, and upstream receptor tyrosine kinases. To characterize the mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK)/ERK dependence of lung cancers harboring BRAF kinase domain mutations, we screened a large panel of human lung cancer cell lines (n = 87) and tumors (n = 916) for BRAF mutations. We found that non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) cells with both V600E and non-V600E BRAF mutations were selectively sensitive to MEK inhibition compared with those harboring mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), KRAS, or ALK and ROS kinase fusions. Supporting its classification as a ""driver"" mutation in the cells in which it is expressed, MEK inhibition in (V600E)BRAF NSCLC cells led to substantial induction of apoptosis, comparable with that seen with EGFR kinase inhibition in EGFR mutant NSCLC models. Despite high basal ERK phosphorylation, EGFR mutant cells were uniformly resistant to MEK inhibition. Conversely, BRAF mutant cell lines were resistant to EGFR inhibition. These data, together with the nonoverlapping pattern of EGFR and BRAF mutations in human lung cancer, suggest that these lesions define distinct clinical entities whose treatment should be guided by prospective real-time genotyping. To facilitate such an effort, we developed a mass spectrometry-based genotyping method for the detection of hotspot mutations in BRAF, KRAS, and EGFR. Using this assay, we confirmed that BRAF mutations can be identified in a minority of NSCLC tumors and that patients whose tumors harbor BRAF mutations have a distinct clinical profile compared with those whose tumors harbor kinase domain mutations in EGFR.",cancer
292,The polymorphisms of TS and MTHFR predict survival of gastric cancer patients treated with fluorouracil-based adjuvant chemotherapy in Chinese population.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the association of the thymidylate synthase (TS) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) polymorphisms with the clinical outcomes of gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. One-hundred and sixteen patients with gastric cancer were treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy. The TS (a 28-bp tandem repeat polymorphism in the TS enhancer region (TSER) and a 6 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region) and MTHFR C677T polymorphisms were determined in blood samples from those patients using PCR and PCR-LDR (ligation detection reaction) method, respectively. The overall survival (OS) in patients with the TS ins6/ins6 genotype was significantly shorter than those in patients with the del6/del6 (P = 0.017) and ins6/del6 (P = 0.022) genotype. The relapse-free survival (RFS) and OS in patients with the MTHFR C/C genotype were significantly worse than those in patients with the T/T or C/T genotype (P = 0.043 and 0.040, respectively). Cox multivariate analysis also showed that patients with the TS ins6/ins6 genotype have worse OS than patients with the T/T or C/T genotype (HR = 2.437, P = 0.041), and the MTHFR C/C genotype was associated with shorter RFS (HR = 1.723, P = 0.031) and OS (HR = 1.681, P = 0.056). No significant association was found between the TSER polymorphism and the clinical outcomes (P > 0.05). The polymorphisms of TS 3'-UTR ins6/del6 and MTHFR C677T appear to be potential prognostic factors in gastric cancer patients treated with 5-FU-based adjuvant chemotherapy, which may allow identification of gastric cancer patients who will benefit from 5-FU chemotherapy.",cancer
822,Kinase-dead BRAF and oncogenic RAS cooperate to drive tumor progression through CRAF.,"We describe a mechanism of tumorigenesis mediated by kinase-dead BRAF in the presence of oncogenic RAS. We show that drugs that selectively inhibit BRAF drive RAS-dependent BRAF binding to CRAF, CRAF activation, and MEK-ERK signaling. This does not occur when oncogenic BRAF is inhibited, demonstrating that BRAF inhibition per se does not drive pathway activation; it only occurs when BRAF is inhibited in the presence of oncogenic RAS. Kinase-dead BRAF mimics the effects of the BRAF-selective drugs and kinase-dead Braf and oncogenic Ras cooperate to induce melanoma in mice. Our data reveal another paradigm of BRAF-mediated signaling that promotes tumor progression. They highlight the importance of understanding pathway signaling in clinical practice and of genotyping tumors prior to administering BRAF-selective drugs, to identify patients who are likely to respond and also to identify patients who may experience adverse effects.",cancer
2182,Spaceflight-Relevant Challenges of Radiation and/or Reduced Weight Bearing Cause Arthritic Responses in Knee Articular Cartilage.,"There is little known about the effect of both reduced weight bearing and exposure to radiation during spaceflight on the mechanically-sensitive cartilage lining the knee joint. In this study, we characterized cartilage damage in rat knees after periods of reduced weight bearing with/without exposure to solar-flare-relevant radiation, then cartilage recovery after return to weight bearing. Male Sprague Dawley rats (n = 120) were either hindlimb unloaded (HLU) via tail suspension or remained weight bearing in cages (GROUND). On day 5, half of the HLU and GROUND rats were 1 Gy total-body X-ray irradiated during HLU, and half were sham irradiated (SHAM), yielding 4 groups: GROUND-SHAM; GROUND-IR; HLU-SHAM; and HLU-IR. Hindlimbs were collected from half of each group of rats on day 13. The remaining rats were then removed from HLU or remained weight bearing, and hindlimbs from these rats were collected on day 63. On day 13, glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content in cartilage lining the tibial plateau and femoral condyles of HLU rats was lower than that of the GROUND animals. Likewise, on day 13, immunoreactivity of the collagen type II-degrading matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) and of a resultant metalloproteinase-generated neoepitope VDIPEN was increased in all groups versus GROUND-SHAM. Clustering of chondrocytes indicating cartilage damage was present in all HLU and IR groups versus GROUND-SHAM on day 13. On day 62, after 49 days of reloading, the loss of GAG content was attenuated in the HLU-SHAM and HLU-IR groups, and the increased VDIPEN staining in all treatment groups was attenuated. However, the increased chondrocyte clustering remained in all treatment groups on day 62. MMP-13 activity also remained elevated in the GROUND-IR and HLU-IR groups. Increased T2 relaxation times, measured on day 62 using 7T MRI, were greater in GROUND-IR and HLU-IR knees, indicating persistent cartilage damage in the irradiated groups. Both HLU and total-body irradiation resulted in acute degenerative and pre-arthritic changes in the knee articular cartilage of rats. A return to normal weight bearing resulted in some recovery from cartilage degradation. However, radiation delivered as both a single challenge and when combined with HLU resulted in chronic cartilage damage. These findings suggest that radiation exposure during spaceflight leads to and/or impairs recovery of cartilage upon return to reloading, generating long-term joint problems for astronauts.",nonCancer
255,Clinical significance of TTF-1 protein expression and TTF-1 gene amplification in lung adenocarcinoma.,"The majority of lung adenocarcinomas express the lineage-specific thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1). We recently reported that in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas the TTF-1 gene is amplified. Although the prognostic significance of TTF-1 expression has been previously investigated, the significance of TTF-1 amplification has not been established. We studied 89 consecutive patients with lung adenocarcinomas treated by surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital between 1997 and 1999 and performed immunohistochemical analysis for TTF-1 expression and fluorescence in situ hybridization for TTF-1 amplification. We investigated associations between clinical-pathological characteristics, TTF-1 expression, TTF-1 amplification and overall survival. TTF-1 expression was categorized as high (48%), low (24%) or absent (28%). TTF-1 was amplified in 7% of cases. Patients with adenocarcinomas with low or high TTF-1 expression had a significantly better outcome than those with absent TTF-1 expression (median overall survival times of 72.4, 77.8 and 30.5 months, respectively, P = 0.002). In contrast, patients with adenocarcinomas with TTF-1 expression had a worse outcome if TTF-1 was amplified (median overall survival time 39.5 versus 87.5 months). In multivariate analysis, improved overall survival was independently predicted by TTF-1 expression in combination with no TTF-1 amplification (P < 0.001). In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, TTF-1 expression is a predictor of good outcome. Patients with no TTF-1 expression or TTF-1 expression and TTF-1 gene amplification tend to have a significantly worse prognosis than patients with TTF-1 expression and no TTF-1 gene amplification.",cancer
357,Different prognostic impact of STK11 mutations in non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer.,"STK11 is commonly mutated in lung cancer. In light of recent experimental data showing that specific STK11 mutants could acquire oncogenic activities due to the synthesis of a short STK11 isoform, we investigated whether this new classification of STK11 mutants could help refine its role as a prognostic marker. We conducted a retrospective high-throughput genotyping study in 567 resected non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. STK11 exons 1 or 2 mutations (STK11ex1-2) with potential oncogenic activity were analyzed separately from exons 3 to 9 (STK11ex3-9). STK11ex1-2 and STK11ex3-9 mutations occurred in 5% and 14% of NSCLC. STK11 mutated patients were younger (P = .01) and smokers (P< .0001). STK11 mutations were significantly associated with KRAS and inversely with EGFR mutations. After a median follow-up of 7.2 years (95%CI 6.8-.4), patients with STK11ex1-2 mutation had a median OS of 24 months (95%CI 15-57) as compared to 69 months (95%CI 56-93) for wild-type (log-rank, P = .005) and to 91 months (95%CI 57-unreached) for STK11ex3-9 mutations (P = .003). In multivariate analysis, STK11ex1-2 mutations remained associated with a poor prognosis (P = .002). Results were validated in two public datasets. Western blots showed that STK11ex1-2 mutatedtumors expressed short STK11 isoforms. Finally using mRNAseq data from the TCGA cohort, we showed that a stroma-derived poor prognosis signature was enriched in STK11ex1-2 mutated tumors. All together our results show that STK11ex1-2 mutations delineate an aggressive subtype of lung cancer for which a targeted treatment through STK11 inhibition might offer new opportunities.",cancer
1274,Larger receptive fields revealed using Battenberg stimuli to assess contrast summation with moving patterns.,"This study reevaluated the summation extent for moving stimuli using the Battenberg summation paradigm (Meese, 2010), which aims to circumvent internal noise changes with increasing stimulus size by holding display size constant. In the checkerboard stimulus, the size of the checks (luminance-modulated drifting gratings) was varied to measure dependence on signal area. Experiment 1 was a contrast detection task that used either signal checks alternating with uniform, mean luminance, checks (single-motion) or alternate checks containing gratings moving in opposite directions (opposing-motion). The latter was designed to test whether summation extent changes when segregating regions based on motion direction. Results showed summation over a square summation area with a side length of 3.33°, much larger than previous estimates of less than 1° for similar stimuli (Anderson & Burr, 1991). This was found for both motion combinations, providing no evidence that summation extent differs when segregating patterns based on direction, at contrast detection threshold. These results are in close agreement with those obtained for static patterns (Meese, 2010) and support the same underlying summation model. Experiment 2 was a contrast increment detection task conducted to determine whether differences in summation extent arise under suprathreshold contrast conditions. There was no dependence on check size for either condition across the range of sizes tested. This supports the suggestion that segmentation mechanisms dominate perception under high-contrast conditions, a potential adaptive strategy employed by the visual system.",nonCancer

Recent literature has shown that the application of mesenchymal stromal cells is safe, in vitro and in vivo, for treating long bone nonunion. The present study was performed to investigate the safety of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) implantation in combination with platelet lysate (PL) product for treating human long bone nonunion.|In this case series clinical trial, orthopedic surgeons visited eighteen patients with long bone nonunion, of whom 7 complied with the eligibility criteria. These patients received mesenchymal stromal cells (20 million cells implanted once into the nonunion site using a fluoroscopic guide) in combination with PL product. For evaluation of the effects of this intervention all the patients were followed up by taking anterior-posterior and lateral X-rays of the affected limb before and 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the implantation. All side effects (local or systemic, serious or non-serious, related or unrelated) were observed during this time period.|From a safety perspective the MSC implantation in combination with PL was very well tolerated during the 12 months of the trial. Four patients were healed; based on the control Xray evidence, bony union had occurred.|Results from the present study suggest that the implantation of bone marrow-derived MSCs in combination with PL is safe for the treatment of nonunion.

841,Targeting activating mutations of EZH2 leads to potent cell growth inhibition in human melanoma by derepression of tumor suppressor genes.,"The epigenetic modifier EZH2 is part of the polycomb repressive complex that suppresses gene expression via histone methylation. Activating mutations in EZH2 are found in a subset of melanoma that contributes to disease progression by inactivating tumor suppressor genes. In this study we have targeted EZH2 with a specific inhibitor (GSK126) or depleted EZH2 protein by stable shRNA knockdown. We show that inhibition of EZH2 has potent effects on the growth of both wild-type and EZH2 mutant human melanoma in vitro particularly in cell lines harboring the EZH2Y646 activating mutation. This was associated with cell cycle arrest, reduced proliferative capacity in both 2D and 3D culture systems, and induction of apoptosis. The latter was caspase independent and mediated by the release of apoptosis inducing factor (AIFM1) from mitochondria. Gene expression arrays showed that several well characterized tumor suppressor genes were reactivated by EZH2 inhibition. This included activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) that was validated as an EZH2 target gene by ChIP-qPCR. These results emphasize a critical role for EZH2 in the proliferation and viability of melanoma and highlight the potential for targeted therapy against EZH2 in treatment of patients with melanoma.",cancer
473,Topoisomerase-II alpha expression as a predictive marker in a population of advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated either with single-agent doxorubicin or single-agent docetaxel.,"The predictive value of topoisomerase-II alpha (topo-II) has been evaluated in advanced breast cancer patients randomly treated with single-agent doxorubicin or docetaxel. Primary tumor samples from patients enrolled in a randomized, phase III clinical trial comparing single-agent doxorubicin (75 mg/m(2) q3wks) with docetaxel (100 mg/m(2) q3wks) were collected and topo-II status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (clone KiS1). Topo-II status was evaluated in 108 samples, 55 (51%) in the doxorubicin arm and 53 (49%) in the docetaxel arm. An increment of 10% in cells expressing topo-II is associated with a statistically significant odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval) of 1.09 (1.03-1.15; P = 0.002) for overall response to doxorubicin versus 1.002 (0.94-1.07; P = 0.95) in the docetaxel arm. With increasing topo-II, the favorable OR for overall response to docetaxel compared with doxorubicin decreases to become not significant in patients with topo-II tumor content >10%. In a multivariate analysis, (a) HER-2 status seems positively correlated with overall response to chemotherapy (OR, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.87-6.27; P = 0.09). (b) Overall response to doxorubicin is significantly lower than overall response to docetaxel (OR, 0.17; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.64; P = 0.009) but with a significant interaction term for doxorubicin-treated patients with topo-II tumor content >10% (OR, 8.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.86-37.03; P = 0.05). (a) Topo-II overexpression confers a higher probability of response in the doxorubicin arm only. (b) Despite being a small retrospective study, this study is in line with previously reported studies and the hypotheses raised are now being tested in a prospective neoadjuvant trial.",cancer
586,Transcriptomic analysis of aggressive meningiomas identifies PTTG1 and LEPR as prognostic biomarkers independent of WHO grade.,"Meningiomas are frequent central nervous system tumors. Although most meningiomas are benign (WHO grade I) and curable by surgery, WHO grade II and III tumors remain therapeutically challenging due to frequent recurrence. Interestingly, relapse also occurs in some WHO grade I meningiomas. Hence, we investigated the transcriptional features defining aggressive (recurrent, malignantly progressing or WHO grade III) meningiomas in 144 cases. Meningiomas were categorized into non-recurrent (NR), recurrent (R), and tumors undergoing malignant progression (M) in addition to their WHO grade. Unsupervised transcriptomic analysis in 62 meningiomas revealed transcriptional profiles lining up according to WHO grade and clinical subgroup. Notably aggressive subgroups (R+M tumors and WHO grade III) shared a large set of differentially expressed genes (n=332; p<0.01, FC>1.25). In an independent multicenter validation set (n=82), differential expression of 10 genes between WHO grades was confirmed. Additionally, among WHO grade I tumors differential expression between NR and aggressive R+M tumors was affirmed for PTTG1, AURKB, ECT2, UBE2C and PRC1, while MN1 and LEPR discriminated between NR and R+M WHO grade II tumors. Univariate survival analysis revealed a significant association with progression-free survival for PTTG1, LEPR, MN1, ECT2, PRC1, COX10, UBE2C expression, while multivariate analysis identified a prediction for PTTG1 and LEPR mRNA expression independent of gender, WHO grade and extent of resection. Finally, stainings of PTTG1 and LEPR confirmed malignancy-associated protein expression changes. In conclusion, based on the so far largest study sample of WHO grade III and recurrent meningiomas we report a comprehensive transcriptional landscape and two prognostic markers.",cancer
1993,Therapists' recognition of alliance ruptures as a moderator of change in alliance and symptoms.,"Therapists' awareness of ruptures in the alliance may determine whether such ruptures will prove beneficial or obstructive to the therapy process.|This study investigated the associations between therapists' recognition of these ruptures, and changes in clients' alliance ratings and symptom reports, using time-series data in a naturalistic treatment setting.|Eighty-four clients treated by 56 therapists completed alliance measures after each session, and the clients also completed symptom measures at the beginning of each session.|Therapists' recognition of alliance rupture in non-rupture sessions was positively associated with clients' alliance ratings in the next session and this effect was significantly higher when rupture did occur. There was also a significant interaction effect for functioning ratings: Therapists' recognition of alliance ruptures abolished the negative effect of ruptures on clients' symptom ratings in the following session.|These results highlight the importance of therapists' recognition of deterioration in the alliance for a repair process to take place that may eventually lead to an improved relationship and outcome.",nonCancer
637,KRAS as prognostic biomarker in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab: a pooled analysis of 12 published trials.,"The significance of KRAS in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treated with bevacizumab (B) is not well understood. We conducted a systematic review and pooled analysis of published trials with the aim to assess the predictive and prognostic role of KRAS status in patients treated with B. We performed a systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials. The primary endpoints included objective response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The odds ratio (OR) for RR and hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated or extracted by published data either using a fixed effect model or a random effect model. A total of 12 studies were included. A total of 2,266 patients were analysed (54 % were KRAS wt). The pooled RRs for KRAS wild-type (wt) versus mutated (mut) patients were 54.8 and 48.3 %, respectively (OR 1.42, P = 0.02). Median PFS was significantly longer in KRAS wt patients compared with that in KRAS mut patients (HR = 0.85; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.74-0.98; P = 0.02). Similarly, median OS was significantly better in wt KRAS patients compared with that in mut KRAS patients (HR = 0.65; 95 % CI 0.46-0.92; P = 0.01). This pooled analysis of 12 published studies shows that KRAS wt status is a good prognostic factor for B-based chemotherapy. Also, KRAS wt CRC is associated with a better RR with B plus chemotherapy than mut counterpart.",cancer
1578,Six Germline Genetic Variations Impair the Translesion Synthesis Activity of Human DNA Polymerase κ.,"DNA polymerase (pol) κ efficiently catalyzes error-free translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) opposite bulky N(2)-guanyl lesions induced by carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. We investigated the biochemical effects of nine human nonsynonymous germline POLK variations on the TLS properties of pol κ, utilizing recombinant pol κ (residues 1-526) enzymes and DNA templates containing an N(2)-CH2(9-anthracenyl)G (N(2)-AnthG), 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG), O(6)-methyl(Me)G, or an abasic site. In steady-state kinetic analyses, the R246X, R298H, T473A, and R512W variants displayed 7- to 18-fold decreases in kcat/Km for dCTP insertion opposite G and N(2)-AnthG, with 2- to 3-fold decreases in DNA binding affinity, compared to wild-type, and further showed 5- to 190-fold decreases in kcat/Km for next-base extension from C paired with N(2)-AnthG. The A471V variant showed 2- to 4-fold decreases in kcat/Km for correct nucleotide insertion opposite and beyond G (or N(2)-AnthG) compared to wild-type. These five hypoactive variants also showed similar patterns of attenuation of TLS activity opposite 8-oxoG, O(6)-MeG, and abasic lesions. By contrast, the T44M variant exhibited 7- to 11-fold decreases in kcat/Km for dCTP insertion opposite N(2)-AnthG and O(6)-MeG (as well as for dATP insertion opposite an abasic site), but not opposite both G and 8-oxoG, nor beyond N(2)-AnthG, compared to wild-type. These results suggest that the R246X, R298H, T473A, R512W, and A471V variants cause a general catalytic impairment of pol κ opposite G and all four lesions, whereas the T44M variaant induces opposite lesion-dependent catalytic impairment-i.e., only opposite O(6)-MeG, abasic, and bulky N(2)-G lesions, but not opposite G and 8-oxoG-in pol κ, which might indicate that these hypoactive pol κ variants are genetic factors in modifying individual susceptibility to genotoxic carcinogens in certain subsets of populations.",nonCancer
1821,Hydrodynamic Propulsion of Liposomes Electrostatically Attracted to a Lipid Membrane Reveals Size-Dependent Conformational Changes.,"The efficiency of lipid nanoparticle uptake across cellular membranes is strongly dependent on the very first interaction step. Detailed understanding of this step is in part hampered by the large heterogeneity in the physicochemical properties of lipid nanoparticles, such as liposomes, making conventional ensemble-averaging methods too blunt to address details of this complex process. Here, we contribute a means to explore whether individual liposomes become deformed upon binding to fluid cell-membrane mimics. This was accomplished by using hydrodynamic forces to control the propulsion of nanoscale liposomes electrostatically attracted to a supported lipid bilayer. In this way, the size of individual liposomes could be determined by simultaneously measuring both their individual drift velocity and diffusivity, revealing that for a radius of ∼45 nm, a close agreement with dynamic light scattering data was observed, while larger liposomes (radius ∼75 nm) displayed a significant deformation unless composed of a gel-phase lipid. The relevance of being able to extract this type of information is discussed in the context of membrane fusion and cellular uptake.",nonCancer
1396,Pharmacological Targeting the REV-ERBs in Sleep/Wake Regulation.,"The circadian clock maintains appropriate timing for a wide range of behaviors and physiological processes. Circadian behaviors such as sleep and wakefulness are intrinsically dependent on the precise oscillation of the endogenous molecular machinery that regulates the circadian clock. The identical core clock machinery regulates myriad endocrine and metabolic functions providing a link between sleep and metabolic health. The REV-ERBs (REV-ERBα and REV-ERBβ) are nuclear receptors that are key regulators of the molecular clock and have been successfully targeted using small molecule ligands. Recent studies in mice suggest that REV-ERB-specific synthetic agonists modulate metabolic activity as well as alter sleep architecture, inducing wakefulness during the light period. Therefore, these small molecules represent unique tools to extensively study REV-ERB regulation of sleep and wakefulness. In these studies, our aim was to further investigate the therapeutic potential of targeting the REV-ERBs for regulation of sleep by characterizing efficacy, and optimal dosing time of the REV-ERB agonist SR9009 using electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Applying different experimental paradigms in mice, our studies establish that SR9009 does not lose efficacy when administered more than once a day, nor does tolerance develop when administered once a day over a three-day dosing regimen. Moreover, through use of a time response paradigm, we determined that although there is an optimal time for administration of SR9009 in terms of maximal efficacy, there is a 12-hour window in which SR9009 elicited a response. Our studies indicate that the REV-ERBs are potential therapeutic targets for treating sleep problems as those encountered as a consequence of shift work or jet lag.",nonCancer
1985,Graph coarse-graining reveals differences in the module-level structure of functional brain networks.,"Networks have become a standard tool for analysing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. In this approach, brain areas and their functional connections are mapped to the nodes and links of a network. Even though this mapping reduces the complexity of the underlying data, it remains challenging to understand the structure of the resulting networks due to the large number of nodes and links. One solution is to partition networks into modules and then investigate the modules' composition and relationship to brain functioning. While this approach works well for single networks, understanding differences between two networks by comparing their partitions is difficult and alternative approaches are thus necessary. To this end, we present a coarse-graining framework that uses a single set of data-driven modules as a frame of reference, enabling one to zoom out from the node- and link-level details. As a result, differences in the module-level connectivity can be understood in a transparent, statistically verifiable manner. We demonstrate the feasibility of the method by applying it to networks constructed from fMRI data recorded from 13 healthy subjects during rest and movie viewing. While independently partitioning the rest and movie networks is shown to yield little insight, the coarse-graining framework enables one to pinpoint differences in the module-level structure, such as the increased number of intra-module links within the visual cortex during movie viewing. In addition to quantifying differences due to external stimuli, the approach could also be applied in clinical settings, such as comparing patients with healthy controls.

636,Targeting TBK1 inhibits migration and resistance to MEK inhibitors in mutant NRAS melanoma.,"Melanoma is a devastating form of skin cancer with limited therapeutic options. Fifteen to 20% of patients with melanoma have an activating mutation in the GTPase, NRAS. The major downstream effectors of RAS are RAFs (ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the Ral guanine exchange factors (RalGEF). TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) is an atypical IκB kinase family member that acts downstream of RalGEFs. Whereas many studies have analyzed RAF and PI3K signaling in mutant NRAS melanoma, the role of RalGEF/Ral is understudied and TBK1 has not been examined. To address this, TBK1 was modulated with knockdown approaches and targeted therapies to determine the role of TBK1 in motility, apoptosis, and signaling. In melanoma, NRAS overexpression increased TBK1 phosphorylation. TBK1 depletion inhibited migration and invasion, whereas its constitutive overexpression led to an increase in invasion. In three-dimensional systems that mimic the dermal microenvironment, TBK1 depletion or inhibition cooperated with MEK inhibitors to promote apoptosis, particularly in the context of MEK-insensitive mutant NRAS. This effect was absent in melanoma cells that are wild-type for NRAS. These results suggest the utility of TBK1 inhibitors as part of a treatment regimen for patients with mutant NRAS melanoma, for whom there are no current effective therapies. TBK1 promotes the malignant properties of NRAS-mutant melanoma and its targeting, in combination with MEK, promotes apoptosis, thus providing a potential novel targeted therapeutic option.",cancer
1283,Assessing Cardiovascular Risk to Guide Hypertension Diagnosis and Treatment.,"The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) demonstrated the benefit of lowering systolic blood pressure (SBP) to 120 mm Hg, yet other trials, such as Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3), did not find consistent benefit. How to incorporate these results into the treatment of those with elevated SBP in the general population is not clear.|To assess the representativeness of SPRINT and HOPE-3 relative to patients in the United States and to explore the cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk profiles of various populations with elevated SBP.|The study examined data from nonpregnant adults aged 20 to 79 years participating in the 2007-2012 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) who had complete data available (n = 14 142), representing 206.9 million US adults. The study was performed from October 1, 2015, to August 2, 2016.|The study estimated the number and characteristics of adults with SBP of 120 mm Hg or higher, including SPRINT and HOPE-3 eligibility, and estimated who may have newly required treatment initiation or intensification if various trial or risk-based criteria were applied.|NHANES included completed clinical evaluations from mobile examination centers on 15 974 adults aged 20 to 79 years (mean [SD] age, 45.9 [15.5] years). The study excluded 182 pregnant women and 1650 adults in whom CVD risk data were unavailable, leaving a final study population of 14 142 (50.5% women [95% CI, 49.6%-51.3%] and 49.5% men [95% CI, 48.6%-50.4%]). An estimated 53.3 million untreated and 19.8 million treated US adults have an SBP in the diagnostic and treatment gray zone (120-139 mm Hg), a small proportion of whom would have been eligible for SPRINT (5.4% untreated, 13.9% treated) or HOPE-3 (13.9% treated, 1.7% untreated). Even among those with prior CVD or high risk of CVD and elevated SBP (120-139 mm Hg), only a few would have qualified for SPRINT (27.0% and 21.9% of untreated and treated patients, respectively) or HOPE-3 (10.6% and 2.1% of untreated and treated, respectively). If blood pressure treatment recommendations were extended to adults with an SBP between 120 and 139 mm Hg, as well as prior CVD or CVD risk of 15% or higher, then 5.8 million untreated adults would be reclassified as treatment eligible; furthermore, 8.5 million treated patients would require medication intensification.|Millions of US adults have elevated SBP and high CVD risk, most of whom would not have been eligible for SPRINT. Until more definitive evidence becomes available, clinicians should consider a management paradigm based on CVD risk in addition to blood pressure measurements.",nonCancer
227,IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in gliomas.,"A recent genomewide mutational analysis of glioblastomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade IV glioma) revealed somatic mutations of the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 gene (IDH1) in a fraction of such tumors, most frequently in tumors that were known to have evolved from lower-grade gliomas (secondary glioblastomas). We determined the sequence of the IDH1 gene and the related IDH2 gene in 445 central nervous system (CNS) tumors and 494 non-CNS tumors. The enzymatic activity of the proteins that were produced from normal and mutant IDH1 and IDH2 genes was determined in cultured glioma cells that were transfected with these genes. We identified mutations that affected amino acid 132 of IDH1 in more than 70% of WHO grade II and III astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas and in glioblastomas that developed from these lower-grade lesions. Tumors without mutations in IDH1 often had mutations affecting the analogous amino acid (R172) of the IDH2 gene. Tumors with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations had distinctive genetic and clinical characteristics, and patients with such tumors had a better outcome than those with wild-type IDH genes. Each of four tested IDH1 and IDH2 mutations reduced the enzymatic activity of the encoded protein. Mutations of NADP(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenases encoded by IDH1 and IDH2 occur in a majority of several types of malignant gliomas.",cancer

Hence, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting PI3K with GDC-0032, a PI3K inhibitor with potent activity against p110α, in combination with radiation in HNSCC. The efficacy of GDC-0032 was assessedin vitroin 26 HNSCC cell lines with crystal violet proliferation assays, and changes in PI3K signaling were measured by Western blot analysis. Cytotoxicity and radiosensitization were assessed with Annexin V staining via flow cytometry and clonogenic survival assays, respectively. DNA damage repair was assessed with immunofluorescence for γH2AX foci, and cell cycle analysis was performed with flow cytometry.In vivoefficacy of GDC-0032 and radiation was assessed in xenografts implanted into nude mice. GDC-0032 inhibited potently PI3K signaling and displayed greater antiproliferative activity in HNSCC cell lines withPIK3CAmutations or amplification, whereas cell lines withPTENalterations were relatively resistant to its effects. Pretreatment with GDC-0032 radiosensitizedPIK3CA-mutant HNSCC cells, enhanced radiation-induced apoptosis, impaired DNA damage repair, and prolonged G2-M arrest following irradiation. Furthermore, combined GDC-0032 and radiation was more effective than either treatment alonein vivoin subcutaneous xenograft models. GDC-0032 has increased potency in HNSCC cell lines harboringPIK3CA-activating aberrations.

We aimed to estimate the current prevalence of hypertension, associated risk factors, and its geographic variation in Luxembourg.Cross-sectional, population-based data on 1497 randomly selected Luxembourg residents aged 25 to 64 years were collected as part of the European Health Examination Survey from 2013 to 2015. Hypertension was defined as systolic/diastolic blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg, self-report of a physician diagnosis or on antihypertensive medication. Standard and Bayesian regressions were used to examine associations between hypertension and covariates, and also geographic distribution of hypertension across the country.Nearly 31% of Luxembourg residents were hypertensive, and over 70% of those were either unaware of their condition or not adequately controlled. The likelihood of hypertension was lower in men more physically active (odds ratio [95% credible region] 0.6 [0.4, 0.9]) and consuming alcohol daily (0.3 [0.1, 0.8]), and higher in men with a poor health perception (1.6 [1.0, 2.7]) and in women experiencing depressive symptoms (1.8 [1.3, 2.7]). There were geographic variations in hypertension prevalence across cantons and municipalities. The highest odds ratio was observed in the most industrialized region (South-West) (1.2 [0.9, 1.6]) with a positive effect at 90% credible region.In Luxembourg, the vast majority of people with hypertension are either unaware of their condition or not adequately controlled, which constitutes a major, neglected public health challenge. There are geographic variations in hypertension prevalence in Luxembourg, hence the role of individual and regional risk factors along with public health initiatives to reduce disease burden should be considered.",nonCancer
613,Pharmacological targeting of the Wdr5-MLL interaction in C/EBPα N-terminal leukemia.,"The CEBPA gene is mutated in 9% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Selective expression of a short (30-kDa) CCAAT-enhancer binding protein-α (C/EBPα) translational isoform, termed p30, represents the most common type of CEBPA mutation in AML. The molecular mechanisms underlying p30-mediated transformation remain incompletely understood. We show that C/EBPα p30, but not the normal p42 isoform, preferentially interacts with Wdr5, a key component of SET/MLL (SET-domain/mixed-lineage leukemia) histone-methyltransferase complexes. Accordingly, p30-bound genomic regions were enriched for MLL-dependent H3K4me3 marks. The p30-dependent increase in self-renewal and inhibition of myeloid differentiation required Wdr5, as downregulation of the latter inhibited proliferation and restored differentiation in p30-dependent AML models. OICR-9429 is a new small-molecule antagonist of the Wdr5-MLL interaction. This compound selectively inhibited proliferation and induced differentiation in p30-expressing human AML cells. Our data reveal the mechanism of p30-dependent transformation and establish the essential p30 cofactor Wdr5 as a therapeutic target in CEBPA-mutant AML.",cancer
596,Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors with t(X;18). A pathologic and molecular genetic study.,"Spindle cell sarcomas often present the surgical pathologist with a considerable diagnostic challenge. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, leiomyosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and monophasic synovial sarcoma may all appear similar histologically. The application of ancillary diagnostic modalities, such as immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy, may be helpful in the differentiation of these tumors, but in cases in which these adjunctive techniques fail to demonstrate any more definitive evidence of differentiation, tumor categorization may remain difficult. Cytogenetic and molecular genetic characterization of tumors have provided the basis for the application of molecular assays as the newest components of the diagnostic armamentarium. Because the chromosomal translocation t(X;18) has been observed repeatedly in many synovial sarcomas, it has been heralded as a diagnostic hallmark of synovial sarcoma. To formally test the specificity of this translocation for the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma, RNA extracted from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from a variety of soft tissue and spindle cell tumors was evaluated for the presence of t(X;18) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Although 85% of the synovial sarcomas studied demonstrated t(X;18), 75% of the malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors in our cohort also demonstrated this translocation. We conclude that the translocation t(X;18) is not specific to synovial sarcoma and discuss the implications of the demonstration of t(X;18) in a majority of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.",cancer
2388,Anomalous Origin of the Left Coronary Artery from the Pulmonary Artery: The Role of Multislice Computed Tomography (MSCT).,"Anomalous origin of the left coronary artery from the pulmonary artery (ALCAPA) is a rare congenital coronary abnormality also known as Bland-White-Garland syndrome. The incidence of ALCAPA is about 1 in every 300,000 live births, and constitutes 0.24% and 0.46% of all congenital cardiac disease. It has a high infant mortality rate reaching up to 90% if left untreated. For many years, the diagnosis of ALCAPA was by angiography or autopsy. However, multislice computed tomography (MSCT) is a non-invasive imaging tool that allows accurate, non-invasive diagnosis of ALCAPA. Here we report a case of ALCAPA in a six-month-old girl who presented with a two-week history of cough, fever, tachypnea, and sweating during feeding.

2030,Analysis of the hormone receptor status of circulating tumor cell subpopulations based on epithelial-mesenchymal transition: a proof-of-principle study on the heterogeneity of circulating tumor cells.,"Although the enumeration of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) has been demonstrated to be a prognostic indicator in metastatic breast cancer, the heterogeneous characteristics of CTCs, such as variations in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), may limit its broad clinical application. To investigate an uncomplicated and practicable detection approach based on the potential utility of the heterogeneity of CTCs from the standpoint of the EMT phenotype and ER/PR status of CTCs, an analysis was conducted using peripheral blood samples obtained from 28 metastatic breast cancer patients. The CanPatrol CTC enrichment technique was used to identify different CTC subpopulations, including epithelial-dominated CTCs, biophenotypic epithelial/mesenchymal CTCs, and mesenchymal-dominated CTCs, according to epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Furthermore, the hormone receptor (HR) status of each CTC was determined based on the expression levels of three reference genes and was characterized by four levels, which ranged from high-level expression to non-expression. We subsequently concluded that based on EMT phenotypes, the order of different CTC subgroups differed according to the HR expression status of the primary tumor. With respect to the HR status between tissues and CTCs, the variation tendency from high-level expression to non-expression of HR in CTCs was significantly correlated with the HR status of the primary tumor. The findings could provide evidence for the potential application of this uncomplicated and practicable detection approach for prognostic analysis and individualized endocrine therapeutic direction in a real-time manner via confirmation in further large-scale trials.",nonCancer
2008,Nanoscale Electrochemical Sensor Arrays: Redox Cycling Amplification in Dual-Electrode Systems.,"Micro- and nanofabriation technologies have a tremendous potential for the development of powerful sensor array platforms for electrochemical detection. The ability to integrate electrochemical sensor arrays with microfluidic devices nowadays provides possibilities for advanced lab-on-a-chip technology for the detection or quantification of multiple targets in a high-throughput approach. In particular, this is interesting for applications outside of analytical laboratories, such as point-of-care (POC) or on-site water screening where cost, measurement time, and the size of individual sensor devices are important factors to be considered. In addition, electrochemical sensor arrays can monitor biological processes in emerging cell-analysis platforms. Here, recent progress in the design of disease model systems and organ-on-a-chip technologies still needs to be matched by appropriate functionalities for application of external stimuli and read-out of cellular activity in long-term experiments. Preferably, data can be gathered not only at a singular location but at different spatial scales across a whole cell network, calling for new sensor array technologies. In this Account, we describe the evolution of chip-based nanoscale electrochemical sensor arrays, which have been developed and investigated in our group. Focusing on design and fabrication strategies that facilitate applications for the investigation of cellular networks, we emphasize the sensing of redox-active neurotransmitters on a chip. To this end, we address the impact of the device architecture on sensitivity, selectivity as well as on spatial and temporal resolution. Specifically, we highlight recent work on redox-cycling concepts using nanocavity sensor arrays, which provide an efficient amplification strategy for spatiotemporal detection of redox-active molecules. As redox-cycling electrochemistry critically depends on the ability to miniaturize and integrate closely spaced electrode systems, the fabrication of suitable nanoscale devices is of utmost importance for the development of this advanced sensor technology. Here, we address current challenges and limitations, which are associated with different redox cycling sensor array concepts and fabrication approaches. State-of-the-art micro- and nanofabrication technologies based on optical and electron-beam lithography allow precise control of the device layout and have led to a new generation of electrochemical sensor architectures for highly sensitive detection. Yet, these approaches are often expensive and limited to clean-room compatible materials. In consequence, they lack possibilities for upscaling to high-throughput fabrication at moderate costs. In this respect, self-assembly techniques can open new routes for electrochemical sensor design. This is true in particular for nanoporous redox cycling sensor arrays that have been developed in recent years and provide interesting alternatives to clean-room fabricated nanofluidic redox cycling devices. We conclude this Account with a discussion of emerging fabrication technologies based on printed electronics that we believe have the potential of transforming current redox cycling concepts from laboratory tools for fundamental studies and proof-of-principle analytical demonstrations into high-throughput devices for rapid screening applications.",nonCancer
2022,Rig-G is a growth inhibitory factor of lung cancer cells that suppresses STAT3 and NF-κB.,"The expression of the retinoic acid-induced G (Rig-G) gene, an all trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-inducible gene, was observed in multiple cancer cells, including lung cancer cells. However, whether Rig-G is a tumor suppressor in lung cancer is unknown. Here, we found that ectopic expression of Rig-G can lead to a significant decrease in proliferation of lung cancer cells, resulting in an inhibition of tumor growth. Rig-G knockdown results in a modest increase in cell proliferation, as well as confers an increase in colony formation. Furthermore, transcriptome and pathway analyses of cancer cells revealed a fundamental impact of Rig-G on various growth signaling pathways, including the NF-κB pathway. Rig-G inhibits NF-κB activity by suppressing STAT3 in lung cancer cells. The downregulation of miR21 and miR181b-1 and subsequent activation of PTEN/Akt and CYLD/IκB signaling axis leading to decreased NF-κB activity required to maintain the tumor-inhibiting effect of Rig-G.. Our findings contribute to a better understanding of the antitumor effect mechanism of Rig-G, as well as offer a novel strategy for lung cancer therapy.",nonCancer
422,SMARCA4/BRG1 Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker Predictive of Cisplatin-Based Chemotherapy Outcomes in Resected Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Identification of predictive biomarkers is critically needed to improve selection of patients who derive the most benefit from platinum-based chemotherapy. We hypothesized that decreased expression of SMARCA4/BRG1, a known regulator of transcription and DNA repair, is a novel predictive biomarker of increased sensitivity to adjuvant platinum-based therapies in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The prognostic value was tested using a gene-expression microarray from the Director's Challenge Lung Study (n = 440). The predictive significance of SMARCA4 was determined using a gene-expression microarray (n = 133) from control and treatment arms of the JBR.10 trial of adjuvant cisplatin/vinorelbine. Kaplan-Meier method and log-rank tests were used to estimate and test the differences of probabilities in overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) between expression groups and treatment arms. Multivariate Cox regression models were used while adjusting for other clinical covariates. In the Director's Challenge Study, reduced expression of SMARCA4 was associated with poor OS compared with high and intermediate expression (P < 0.001 and P = 0.009, respectively). In multivariate analysis, compared with low, high SMARCA4 expression predicted a decrease in risk of death [HR, 0.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.4-0.8; P = 0.002]. In the JBR.10 trial, improved 5-year DSS was noted only in patients with low SMARCA4 expression when treated with adjuvant cisplatin/vinorelbine [HR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-0.5, P = 0.002 (low); HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-2.3, P = 0.92 (high)]. An interaction test was highly significant (P = 0.01). Low expression of SMARCA4/BRG1 is significantly associated with worse prognosis; however, it is a novel significant predictive biomarker for increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy in NSCLC.

484,High expression of class III β-tubulin predicts good response to neoadjuvant taxane and doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy in estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer.,"Expression of class ΙΙΙ β-tubulin (βΙΙΙ-tubulin) correlates with tumor progression and resistance to taxane-based therapies for several human malignancies including breast cancer. However its predictive value in a neoadjuvant setting in breast cancer remains unexplored. The objective of this explorative study was to determine whether βΙΙΙ-tubulin expression in breast cancer correlated with pathologic characteristics and whether its expression was predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. We determined βΙΙΙ-tubulin expression in 85 breast cancers, including 41 localized breast cancers treated with primary surgery and 44 treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy before surgery. βΙΙΙ-tubulin expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical methods and was correlated with pathologic characteristics and response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using residual cancer burden (RCB) score. High βΙΙΙ-tubulin expression was significantly associated with poorly differentiated high-grade breast cancers (P = .003) but not with tumor size, estrogen receptor (ER) status, or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/neu overexpression. In ER(-) tumors treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy, high βΙΙΙ-tubulin expression was associated with a significantly greater likelihood of achieving a good pathologic response to chemotherapy as reflected by lower RCB scores (P = .021). This study reveals differential βΙΙΙ-tubulin expression in breast cancers of different histologic grades, hormone receptors, and HER2/neu status. It also suggests a potential role for βΙΙΙ-tubulin as a predictive biomarker for response in neoadjuvant chemotherapy for ER(-) breast cancer, which has not been previously reported. These data provide a strong rationale for considering βΙΙΙ-tubulin status and further validation of this marker in a large study.",cancer
1188,"Randomized phase II study of erlotinib in combination with placebo or R1507, a monoclonal antibody to insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor, for advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer.","R1507 is a selective, fully human, recombinant monoclonal antibody (immunoglobulin G1 subclass) against insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R). The strong preclinical evidence supporting coinhibition of IGF-1R and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as anticancer therapy prompted this study. Patients with advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression following one or two prior regimens, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, and measurable disease were eligible. Patients were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib (150 mg orally once a day) in combination with either placebo, R1507 9 mg/kg weekly, or R1507 16 mg/kg intravenously once every 3 weeks. Treatment cycles were repeated every 3 weeks. The primary end point was comparison of the 12-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate. In all, 172 patients were enrolled: median age, 61 years; female, 33%; never-smokers, 12%; and performance status 0 or 1, 88%. The median number of R1507 doses was six for the weekly arm and 3.5 for the every-3-weeks arm. Grades 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 37%, 44%, and 48% of patients with placebo, R1507 weekly, and R1507 every 3 weeks, respectively. The 12-week PFS rates were 39%, 37%, and 44%, and the median overall survival was 8.1, 8.1, and 12.1 months for the three groups, respectively, with statistically nonsignificant hazard ratios. The 12-week PFS rate in patients with KRAS mutation was 36% with R1507 compared with 0% with placebo. The combination of R1507 with erlotinib did not provide PFS or survival advantage over erlotinib alone in an unselected group of patients with advanced NSCLC. Predictive biomarkers are essential for further development of combined inhibition of IGF-1R and EGFR.",cancer
2491,"Antibiotic susceptibility, antibacterial activity and characterisation of Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from breast milk.","Enterococci, which have useful biotechnological applications, produce bacteriocins, including those that exert anti-Listerial activity. The present study aimed to determine the antibiotic susceptibility patterns and antimicrobial activity of Enterococcus faecium strains isolated from human breast milk. The strains were identified using carbohydrate fermentation tests and ribotyping. Subsequently, the antibacterial activity of the isolates was investigated, and the quantities of lactic acid and hydrogen peroxide produced, and the proteolytic activity of E. faecium, were determined. In addition, biofilm formation by E. faecium strains was assessed. E. faecium strains exhibited antimicrobial activity against food-borne and clinical bacterial isolates. Furthermore, following 24 h incubation, the tested strains exhibited resistance to a pH range of 2.0-9.5 and tolerance of bile acid, lysozyme activity and phenol. Supernatants of the E. faecium TM13, TM15, TM17 and TM18 strains were shown to be effective against Listeria monocytogenes, and were also resistant to heat. Further studies are required in order to determine whether certain strains of E. faecium may be used for the development of novel antibacterial agents.",nonCancer
1158,The mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) induces growth arrest in melanoma cells and tumor regression when combined with docetaxel.,"Disseminated melanoma is highly therapy resistant. The finding that 66% of melanomas harbor the activating BRAF(V600E) mutation has raised expectations for targeting the Ras/RAF/mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK)/ERK pathway in melanoma. This study addresses the anti-melanoma activity of the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (ARRY-142886). We recently have shown that growing melanoma cells as three-dimensional collagen-implanted spheroids enhances resistance to the MEK inhibitor U0126. Here, we investigated the anti-melanoma activity of AZD6244 in two-dimensional cell culture, the three-dimensional spheroid model, and an in vivo model. In two-dimensional cell culture, AZD6244 was cytostatic and reduced the growth of melanoma cells in a concentration-dependent fashion through the induction of G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest. In our three-dimensional spheroid model, the effects of AZD6244 were largely cytostatic and reversible, with drug washout leading to spheroid regrowth. Finally, 1205Lu cells were grown as tumor xenografts in severe combined immunodeficient mice. After tumor establishment, mice were dosed twice daily with 0, 10, or 30 mg/kg AZD6244 p.o. AZD6244 treatment decreased phospho-ERK in the tumors and significantly suppressed tumor growth. The original tumors remained viable, suggesting that AZD6244 monotherapy was largely cytostatic, and not proapoptotic in this model. Further studies showed that co-administration of AZD6244 (30 mg/kg) with docetaxel (15 mg/kg) led to tumor regression, indicating the potential for MEK inhibitor/chemotherapy drug combinations. Inhibition of MEK is cytostatic as a monotherapy in melanoma, but cytotoxic when combined with docetaxel.",cancer
56,Prognostic value of BRAF mutations in localized cutaneous melanoma.,"BRAF mutations are frequent in melanoma but their prognostic significance remains unclear. We sought to further evaluate the prognostic value of BRAF mutations in localized cutaneous melanoma. We undertook an observational retrospective study of 147 patients with localized invasive (stages I and II) cutaneous melanomas to determine the prognostic value of BRAF mutation status. After a median follow-up of 48 months, patients with localized melanomas with BRAF-mutant melanomas exhibited poorer disease-free survival than those with BRAF-wt genotype (hazard ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-4.3) even after adjustment for Breslow thickness, tumor ulceration, location, age, sex, and tumor mitotic rate. The retrospective design and the small number of events are limitations. Our findings suggest that reappraisal of clinical treatment approaches for patients with localized melanoma harboring tumors with BRAF mutation might be warranted.",cancer
500,C609T polymorphism of NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 as a predictive biomarker for response to amrubicin.,"Amrubicin is a promising agent in the treatment of lung cancer, but predictive biomarkers have not yet been described. NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is an enzyme known to metabolize amrubicinol, the active metabolite of amrubicin, to an inactive compound. We examined the relationship between NQO1 and amrubicinol cytotoxicity. Gene and protein expression of NQO1, amrubicinol cytotoxicity, and C609T single-nucleotide polymorphism of NQO1 were evaluated in 29 lung cancer cell lines: 14 small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and 15 non-SCLC (NSCLC). The involvement of NQO1 in amrubicinol cytotoxicity was evaluated by small interfering RNA against NQO1. A significant inverse relationship between both gene and protein expression of NQO1 and amrubicinol cytotoxicity was found in all cell lines. Treatment with NQO1 small interfering RNA increased amrubicinol cytotoxicity and decreased NQO1 expression in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. Furthermore, cell lines genotyped homozygous for the 609T allele showed significantly lower NQO1 protein expression and higher sensitivity for amrubicinol than those with the other genotypes in both NSCLC and SCLC cells. NQO1 expression is one of the major determinants for amrubicinol cytotoxicity, and C609T single-nucleotide polymorphism of NQO1 could be a predictive biomarker for response to amrubicin treatment.",cancer
504,Anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocation: a predictive biomarker of pemetrexed in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.,"This study compared the efficacy of pemetrexed in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive versus ALK-negative (epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutant or wild type [WT] for both ALK and EGFR) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC who received second-line pemetrexed and beyond between March 2007 and April 2010 were screened for EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements at Seoul National University Hospital. The clinical and in vitro efficacy of pemetrexed was evaluated for each genotypic group. Ninety-five NSCLC patients were genotyped as follows: 43 (45%) EGFR mutation, 15 (16%) ALK translocation, and 37 (39%) WT. The overall response rate was superior in ALK-translocated patients compared with EGFR mutant or WT patients (46.7 versus 4.7 versus 16.2%, p = 0.001). ALK-positive patients showed longer time to progression than EGFR mutant or WT patients (9.2 versus 1.4 versus 2.9 months, p = 0.001). ALK positivity alone was a significant predictor for overall response rate (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01-0.32; p = 0.001) and time to progression (HR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.24-0.80; p = 0.007). ALK positivity remained independently significant regardless of treatment line (HR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.24-0.77; p = 0.005). Thymidylate synthase mRNA levels in ALK-positive cells were significantly lower compared with control cells (p < 0.05). Pemetrexed is an effective treatment in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC. ALK positivity was independently predictive of pemetrexed efficacy in NSCLC patients.",cancer
1071,PTEN gene mutations are seen in high-grade but not in low-grade gliomas.,"The PTEN gene, located on 10q23, has recently been implicated as a candidate tumor suppressor gene in brain, breast and prostate tumors. In the present study, 123 brain tumors, including various grades and histological types of gliomas occurring in children and adults, were analyzed for PTEN mutations by SSCP assay and sequencing. Mutations in the PTEN gene were found in 13 of 42 adult glioblastomas and 3 of 13 adult anaplastic astrocytomas, whereas none of the 21 low-grade adult gliomas or the 22 childhood gliomas of all grades showed mutations. The single medulloblastoma with a mutation was a recurrent tumor that also possessed a p53 mutation. High-grade adult gliomas with PTEN mutations included cases that also contained gene amplification or p53 gene mutations, as well as cases that did not contain either of these abnormalities. There was no obvious relationship between presence of PTEN mutation and survival; however, there was a tendency for PTEN mutations to occur in older age group patients. This analysis suggest that PTEN gene mutations are restricted to high-grade adult gliomas and that this abnormality is independent of the presence or absence of gene amplification or p53 gene mutation in these tumors.",cancer

Consequently, the current dietary recommendations to restrict saturated fat should be assessed for every case.",nonCancer
2028,Lipocalin 2 over-expression facilitates progress of castration-resistant prostate cancer via improving androgen receptor transcriptional activity.,"Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) is the lethal phenotype of prostate cancer. Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is aberrantly expressed in many cancers including primary prostate cancer (PCa), but its role in CRPC has not been reported.|LCN2 expression was upregulated in human primary PCa and CRPC tissues. Overexpression of LCN2 promoted C4-2B and 22RV1 cell proliferation while knockdown of LCN2 markedly inhibited C4-2B and 22RV1 cell growth. LCN2 overexpression led to increased AR downstream gene SLC45A3 without upregulating AR expression. In the xenograft model, overexpression of LCN2 significantly promoted tumor growth.|LCN2 expression was detected in primary PCa and CRPC tissues and cell lines C4-2B and 22RV1 using immunohistochemistry and western blotting, respectively. Serum LCN2 level was detected vi ELISA. Lentiviruses-mediated over-expression of LCN2 and LCN2 knockdown were performed in CRPC cell lines. Expressions of androgen receptor(AR) downstream genes was examined in cell lines, in CRPC tissues, and in animal models.|LCN2 could facilitate cell proliferation of CRPC via AR transcriptional activity. LCN2 could be a novel target in CRPC.",nonCancer
2184,Computational evaluation of HIV-1 gp120 conformations of soluble trimeric gp140 structures as targets for de novo docking of first- and second-generation small-molecule CD4 mimics.,"Small-molecule CD4 mimics (SMCM's) bind to gp120 subunit of the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) and have been optimized to block cell infection in vitro. The lack of the V1/2 and V3 loops and the presence of the β2/3 and β20/21 strands (bridging sheet) in the available structures of the monomeric gp120 core may limit its applicability as a target for further synthetic optimization of SMCM potency and/or breadth. Here, we employ a combination of binding-site search, docking, estimation of protein-ligand interaction energy, all-atom molecular dynamics, and ELISA-based CD4-binding competition assays to create, characterize, and rationalize models of first- and second-generation of SMCM's bound to the distinct, trimeric BG505 SOSIP.664 structures 4NCO and 4TVP containing V1/2 and V3 loops with no bridging sheet. We demonstrate that the in silico neutralization of the highly conserved D368 is necessary to obtain the correct orientation of SMCM in their binding site when docking against the monomeric gp120 core. The computational results correlate with IC50's measured in CD4 binding competition ELISA and with KD's measured on gp120 core monomer. This supports the hypothesis that the 4NCO trimeric structure represents a viable target for further SMCM's optimization with advantages over both the 4TVP trimer and gp120 core monomer. Finally, the docking protocol has been optimized to screen compounds that can clearly interact with the highly conserved residue D368, increasing the likelihood of future optimizations to arrive at SMCM's with a broader spectrum of activity.",nonCancer
394,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 promotes proliferation and survival via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in bladder cancer.,"Fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) play key roles in proliferation, differentiation, and tumorigenesis. Many urothelial carcinomas contain activating point mutations or increased expression of FGFR3. However, little is known about the role of other FGFRs. We examined FGFR expression in telomerase-immortalized normal human urothelial cells, urothelial carcinoma cell lines, and tumor samples and showed that FGFR1 expression is increased in a high proportion of cell lines and tumors independent of stage and grade. To determine the role of FGFR1 in low-stage bladder cancer, we overexpressed FGFR1 in telomerase-immortalized normal human urothelial cells and examined changes in proliferation and cell survival in response to FGF2. FGFR1 stimulation increased proliferation and reduced apoptosis. To elucidate the mechanistic basis for these alterations, we examined the signaling cascades activated by FGFR1. FRS2alpha and PLCgamma were activated in response to FGF2, leading to activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. The level of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation correlated with the level of cyclin D1, MCL1, and phospho-BAD, which also correlated with FGFR-induced proliferation and survival. Knockdown of FGFR1 in urothelial carcinoma cell lines revealed differential FGFR1 dependence. JMSU1 cells were dependent on FGFR1 expression for survival but three other cell lines were not. Two cell lines (JMSU1 and UMUC3) were dependent on FGFR1 for growth in soft agar. Only one of the cell lines tested (UMUC3) was frankly tumorigenic; here, FGFR1 knockdown inhibited tumor growth. Our results indicate that FGFR1 has significant effects on urothelial cell phenotype and may represent a useful therapeutic target in some cases of urothelial carcinoma.",cancer
1915,Cosmetic Use of AbobotulinumtoxinA in Men: Considerations Regarding Anatomical Differences and Product Characteristics.,"The proportion of men seeking facial rejuvenation with botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA) products is increasing. The number of male patients treated in the 5-year period between 2009 and 2014 grew by 25%. There is little clinical data supporting gender-specific efficacy with regard to dosing and injection placement in men. To nurture the confidence associated with treatment of male patients, clinicians are in need of more informational materials to develop their evaluation and treatment strategies. Three BoNTA products are currently available in the United States (US) for treatment of the upper face. The varying potency of the different BoNTA formulations is reflected by disparate dose-response characteristics, meaning they are not interchangeable for injection purposes. Clinicians who are familiar with the characteristics of all the BoNTA options will be equipped with the necessary tools to provide their male patients with a desired outcome.<br /> Among the product options available in the US, Dysport<sup>&reg;</sup> (abobotulinumtoxinA) (Galderma Laboratories, L.P., Fort Worth, Texas) is unique in that its recommendations for reconstitution provide the clinician with 2 different final product concentrations. The flexibility provided by a variable dose may be a valuable tool for tailoring treatments to male patient-specific needs, which may include a more conservative outcome, maintaining a certain degree of muscle activity and expressivity. Achieving a conservative outcome may be the key to a positive experience for the male patient. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1056-1062.",nonCancer
615,FGFR1 amplification drives endocrine therapy resistance and is a therapeutic target in breast cancer.,"Amplification of fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) occurs in approximately 10% of breast cancers and is associated with poor prognosis. However, it is uncertain whether overexpression of FGFR1 is causally linked to the poor prognosis of amplified cancers. Here, we show that FGFR1 overexpression is robustly associated with FGFR1 amplification in two independent series of breast cancers. Breast cancer cell lines with FGFR1 overexpression and amplification show enhanced ligand-dependent signaling, with increased activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT signaling pathways in response to FGF2, but also show basal ligand-independent signaling, and are dependent on FGFR signaling for anchorage-independent growth. FGFR1-amplified cell lines show resistance to 4-hydroxytamoxifen, which is reversed by small interfering RNA silencing of FGFR1, suggesting that FGFR1 overexpression also promotes endocrine therapy resistance. FGFR1 signaling suppresses progesterone receptor (PR) expression in vitro, and likewise, amplified cancers are frequently PR negative, identifying a potential biomarker for FGFR1 activity. Furthermore, we show that amplified cancers have a high proliferative rate assessed by Ki67 staining and that FGFR1 amplification is found in 16% to 27% of luminal B-type breast cancers. Our data suggest that amplification and overexpression of FGFR1 may be a major contributor to poor prognosis in luminal-type breast cancers, driving anchorage-independent proliferation and endocrine therapy resistance.",cancer

In PCOS group PPTs measured on deltoid and trapezius muscles were higher compared to the controls ( 9.33 ± 1.3 kg/cm2 vs 5.19 ± 0.57 kg/cm2, p <0.001; 8.23 ±1.04 kg/cm2 vs 4.79 ± 0.55 kg/cm2, p< 0.001). The β- endorphin levels positively correlated with PPTs in PCOS group. Increase in β- endorphin level of 1 pg/ml was associated with increase of PPT value on deltoid muscle of 0.23 kg/cm2 (R= 0.632, p=0.011) and of 0.18 kg/cm2 on trapezius muscle (R= 0.588, p =0.037). There were no correlations between testosterone level and PPT in PCOS group.|β- endorphin serum level as well as PPT are higher in lean PCOS group than in controls. We found correlations between β- endorphin levels and PPT in the PCOS group. It may suggest the role of endogenous opioids in the pathogenesis of PCOS and also that the increases in circulating plasma Beta-endorphins concentration can increases PPT in this group.",nonCancer
682,BRD4-targeted therapy induces Myc-independent cytotoxicity in Gnaq/11-mutatant uveal melanoma cells.,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is an aggressive intraocular malignancy with limited therapeutic options. Both primary and metastatic UM are characterized by oncogenic mutations in the G-protein alpha subunit q and 11. Furthermore, nearly 40% of UM has amplification of the chromosomal arm 8q and monosomy of chromosome 3, with consequent anomalies of MYC copy number. Chromatin regulators have become attractive targets for cancer therapy. In particular, the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) inhibitor JQ1 has shown selective inhibition of c-Myc expression with antiproliferative activity in hematopoietic and solid tumors. Here we provide evidence that JQ1 had cytotoxic activity in UM cell lines carrying Gnaq/11 mutations, while in cells without the mutations had little effects. Using microarray analysis, we identified a large subset of genes modulated by JQ1 involved in the regulation of cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA repair. Further analysis of selected genes determined that the concomitant silencing of Bcl-xL and Rad51 represented the minimal requirement to mimic the apoptotic effects of JQ1 in the mutant cells, independently of c-Myc. In addition, administration of JQ1 to mouse xenograft models of Gnaq-mutant UM resulted in significant inhibition of tumor growth.Collectively, our results define BRD4 targeting as a novel therapeutic intervention against UM with Gnaq/Gna11 mutations.",cancer
550,"Primary cross-resistance to BRAFV600E-, MEK1/2- and PI3K/mTOR-specific inhibitors in BRAF-mutant melanoma cells counteracted by dual pathway blockade.","Intrinsic cross-resistance to inhibition of different signaling pathways may hamper development of combinatorial treatments in melanoma, but the relative frequency of this phenotype and the strategies to overcome this hurdle remain poorly understood. Among 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not previously treated with target therapy, 21 (42.9%) showed strong primary resistance (IC50 > 1 μM) to a BRAFV600E inhibitor. Most of the BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cell lines showed also strong or intermediate cross-resistance to MEK1/2- and to PI3K/mTOR-specific inhibitors. Primary cross-resistance was confirmed in an independent set of 23 BRAF-mutant short-term melanoma cell cultures. MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR co-targeting was the most effective approach, compared to BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual blockade, to counteract primary resistance to BRAF inhibition and the cross-resistant phenotype. This was shown by extensive drug interaction analysis, tumor growth inhibition assays in-vivo, p-ERK and p-AKT inhibition, promotion of melanoma apoptosis, apoptosis-related protein modulation, activation of effector caspases and selective modulation of genes involved in melanoma drug resistance and belonging to the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT canonical pathways. Compared to co-targeting of mutant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR, the association of a MEK1/2 and a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor was more effective in the activation of Bax and of caspase-3 and in the induction of caspase-dependent melanoma apoptosis. Furthermore Bax silencing reduced the latter effects. These results suggest that intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition is frequently associated with primary cross-resistance to MEK and PI3K/mTOR blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma and provide pre-clinical evidence for a combinatorial approach to counteract this phenotype.",cancer
1913,"Microneedling Prior to Levulan PDT for the Treatment of Actinic Keratoses: A Split-Face, Blinded Trial.","Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) with topical Levulan is an approved and efficacious method for treating actinic keratoses. This therapy depends on the ability of the Levulan (delta amino levulinic acid) to penetrate the stratum corneum and enter the cells of the epidermis. Microneedling is an increasing popular cosmetic therapy in which an array of tiny needles is used to make holes in the epidermis and presumably induce a wound healing cascade that leads to cosmetic improvement of the skin. We were interested to know if prior microneedling would enhance the penetration of topical Levulan and thus enhance the PDT treatment, and if a cosmetic improvement beyond the PDT alone would be seen when it is used in conjunction with microneedling.<br/> METHODS: 20 patients each with at least 4 non hyperkeratotic AKs on each side of their face were enrolled. All patients were randomized to receive multiple passes with a microneedling device to ½ of their face, left or right, followed by application of Levulan to the entire face. The Levulan was allowed to incubate 1 hour followed by exposure to blue light (Blu U) for 1000 seconds.<br/> RESULTS: 19 patients completed the study with 4-month follow up. The mean percentage reduction in AKs was 89.3% on the microneedling side versus 69.5% on the PDT alone side, a significant difference. A physician's global cosmetic assessment was performed based on Canfield Visia photographs: 15 of the 19 patients had a noticeable improved cosmetic appearance on one side of the face versus the other, and in 13 of these patients the improved side was the microneedled side.<br/> DISCUSSION: Prior microneedling significantly enhances the effect of Levulan PDT. It also seems to provide a cosmetic benefit above and beyond the PDT alone. It was safe and well tolerated in this study. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1072-1074.",nonCancer

This study examined associations between functional variants in ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCG2 genes and clinical outcomes in patients with epithelial ovarian/primary peritoneal cancer (EOC/PPC) following platinum and taxane-based chemotherapy. Sequenom iPLEXTMGOLD Assay and MALDI-TOF platform were used to genotype the non-synonymous G2677T/A (rs2032582; encoding Ala893Ser/Thr) and synonymous C3435T (rs1045642; encoding Ile1145Ile) variants in ABCB1, the non-synonymous G1249A variant in ABCC2 (rs2273697; encoding Val417Ile), and the non-synonymous C421A variant in ABCG2 (rs2231142; encoding Q141K, Gln141Lys) in normal DNA from up to 511 women in Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG) phase III trials, GOG-172 or GOG-182. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were analyzed in relation to genetic polymorphisms using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards model. The C421A variant (CA+AA versus CC) in ABCG2 was associated with a 6-month longer median PFS (22.7 versus 16.8 months, p=0.041). In multivariate analysis, patients with variant genotypes were at a reduced risk of disease progression (hazard ratio [HR]=0.75, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.59-0.96, p=0.022). The association between C421A and OS was not statistically significant (HR=0.88, 95% CI=0.67-1.15, p=0.356). None of the other variants measured in either ABCB1 or ABCC2 was associated with PFS or OS. The C421A variant in ABCG2, previously shown to be associated with enhanced protein degradation and drug sensitivity, was associated with longer PFS in advanced stage EOC/PPC patents treated with platinum+taxane-based chemotherapy.

652,PD-L1 expression as predictive biomarker in patients with NSCLC: a pooled analysis.,"Clinical trials of immune checkpoints modulators, including both programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors, have recently shown promising activity and tolerable toxicity in pre-treated NSCLC patients. However the predictive role of PD-L1 expression is still controversial. This pooled analysis aims to clarify the association of clinical objective responses to anti PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) and tumor PD-L1 expression in pre-treated NSCLC patients. Data from published studies, that evaluated efficacy and safety of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in pre-treated NSCLC patients, stratified by tumor PD-L1 expression status (immunohistochemistry, cut-off point 1%), were collected by searching in PubMed, Cochrane Library, American Society of Clinical Oncology, European Society of Medical Oncology and World Conference of Lung Cancer, meeting proceedings. Pooled Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated for the Overall Response Rate (ORR) (as evaluated by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1), according to PD-L1 expression status. A total of seven studies, with 914 patients, were eligible. Pooled analysis showed that patients with PD-L1 positive tumors (PD-L1 tumor cell staining ≥1%), had a significantly higher ORR, compared to patients with PD-L1 negative tumors (OR: 2.44; 95% CIs: 1.61-3.68). PD-L1 tumor over-expression seems to be associated with higher clinical activity of anti PD-1/PD-L1 MoAbs, in pre-treated NSCLC patients, suggesting a potential role of PD-L1 expression, IHC cut-off point 1%, as predictive biomarker for the selection of patients to treat with immune-checkpoint inhibitors.",cancer
31,Implications of NRAS mutations in AML: a study of 2502 patients.,"We analyzed 2502 patients with acute myeloid leukemia at diagnosis for NRAS mutations around the hot spots at codons 12, 13, and 61 and correlated the results to cytomorphology, cytogenetics, other molecular markers, and prognostic relevance of these mutations. Two hundred fifty-seven (10.3%) of 2502 patients had NRAS mutations (NRAS(mut)). Most mutations (112 of 257; 43.6%) were found at codon 12, mostly resulting in changes from glycine to asparagine. The history of AML did not differ significantly in association with NRAS mutations. The subgroups with inv(16)/t(16;16) and inv(3)/t(3;3) showed a significantly higher frequency of NRAS(mut) (50 of 133, 37.6% [P < .001], and 11 of 41, 26.8% [P = .004], respectively) than the total cohort. In addition, in these 2 subgroups, mutations of codon 61 were significantly overrepresented (both P < .001). In contrast, NRAS mutations were significantly underrepresented in t(15;17) (2 of 102; 2%; P = .005) in the subgroup with MLL/11q23 rearrangements (3 of 77; 3.9%; P = .061) and in the complex aberrant karyotype (4 of 258; 1.6%; P < .001). Overall, we did not find a significant prognostic impact of NRAS(mut) for overall survival, event-free survival, and disease-free survival. However, there was a trend to better survival in most subgroups, especially when other molecular markers (FLT3-LM, MLL-PTD, and NPM) were taken into account.",cancer
628,BRAF mutations in hairy-cell leukemia.,"Hairy-cell leukemia (HCL) is a well-defined clinicopathological entity whose underlying genetic lesion is still obscure. We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing massively parallel sequencing of the whole exome of leukemic and matched normal cells purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL. Whole-exome sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations that were confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in BRAF that results in the BRAF V600E variant protein. Since BRAF V600E is oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried the BRAF V600E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or unclassifiable splenic lymphomas or leukemias. In immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX-4720, a specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V600E mutation was present in all patients with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL.

1381,"Antitumor, Antioxidant, and Nitrite Scavenging Effects of Chinese Water Chestnut (Eleocharis dulcis) Peel Flavonoids.","The preparation, quantification, and characterization of flavonoid compounds from Chinese water chestnut peel (CWCP) flavonoid extract and ethyl acetate fraction (EF), n-butanol fraction, and water fraction were studied. Among these, EF showed the maximum free radical levels (IC50 values of 0.36, 0.40, and 0.37 mg/mL for DPPH•, ABTS•(+) , and •OH, respectively), nitrite scavenging effects (IC50 = 1.89 mg/mL), and A549 cell inhibitory activities (IC50 = 776.12 μg/mL) with the highest value of total flavonoid content (TFC, 421.32 mg/g). Moreover, the contents of 8 flavonoids in this fraction were quantified using high-performance liquid chromatography, and fisetin, diosmetin, luteolin, and tectorigenin were the 4 major flavonoids with levels of 31.66, 29.91, 13.69, and 12.41 mg/g, respectively. Luteolin produced a greater inhibition of human lung cancer A549 cells (IC50 = 59.60 μg/mL) than did fisetin, diosmetin, and tectorigenin. Flow cytometry revealed that the cellular mechanisms of luteolin inhibition of A549 cells were achieved via the induction of cell proliferation arrest at G1 phase and apoptosis/necrosis. Our findings suggest that flavonoids are closely associated with antitumor, antioxidant, and nitrite scavenging effects of CWCP.",nonCancer
801,The MKK7 p.Glu116Lys Rare Variant Serves as a Predictor for Lung Cancer Risk and Prognosis in Chinese.,"Accumulated evidence indicates that rare variants exert a vital role on predisposition and progression of human diseases, which provides neoteric insights into disease etiology. In the current study, based on three independently retrospective studies of 5,016 lung cancer patients and 5,181 controls, we analyzed the associations between five rare polymorphisms (i.e., p.Glu116Lys, p.Asn118Ser, p.Arg138Cys, p.Ala195Thr and p.Leu259Phe) in MKK7 and lung cancer risk and prognosis. To decipher the precise mechanisms of MKK7 rare variants on lung cancer, a series of biological experiments was further performed. We found that the MKK7 p.Glu116Lys rare polymorphism was significantly associated with lung cancer risk, progression and prognosis. Compared with Glu/Glu common genotype, the 116Lys rare variants (Lys/Glu/+ Lys/Lys) presented an adverse effect on lung cancer susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] = 3.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.70-4.01). These rare variants strengthened patients' clinical progression that patients with 116Lys variants had a significantly higher metastasis rate and advanced N, M stages at diagnosis. In addition, the patients with 116Lys variants also contributed to worse cancer prognosis than those carriers with Glu/Glu genotype (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.32-1.78). Functional experiments further verified that the MKK7 p.116Lys variants altered the expression of several cancer-related genes and thus affected lung cancer cells proliferation, tumor growth and metastasis in vivo and in vitro. Taken together, our findings proposed that the MKK7 p.Glu116Lys rare polymorphism incurred a pernicious impact on lung cancer risk and prognosis through modulating expressions of a serial of cancer-related genes.",cancer
1168,"Interplay among BRAF, p16, p53, and MIB1 in pediatric low-grade gliomas.","BRAF rearrangements and BRAF V600E point mutations are recurring events in pediatric low-grade gliomas. However, their clinical significance, including possible interactions between these markers and other glioma biomarkers, is unclear. In this study a retrospective cohort of 198 pediatric low-grade gliomas (including 40 treated with adjuvant therapy) was analyzed for BRAF rearrangements, BRAF V600E, p16/CDKN2A deletion, p53 expression, and MIB1 proliferation index. In tumors with BRAF rearrangement, homozygous p16 deletion correlated with shorter progression-free survival (P = .04). A high MIB1 proliferation index trended toward worse response to adjuvant radiotherapy compared to BRAF-rearranged, p16-intact tumors (P = .08). On multivariate analysis, the 2 most consistently powerful independent adverse prognostic markers were midline location (P = .0001) and p16 deletion (P = .03). Tumors with BRAF V600E had a strong trend toward an increased risk for progression (hazard ratio = 2.48, P = .07), whereas those with BRAF rearrangement had a milder trend toward reduced risk (hazard ratio = .54, P = .15). These data suggest that p16 deletion adversely impacts the outcomes of BRAF-driven gliomas, that high proliferation index may be a better marker of progression risk than BRAF, that BRAF rearrangement and BRAF V600E might not necessarily produce comparable outcomes, and that none of these markers is stronger than tumor location in determining prognosis in pediatric low-grade gliomas.",cancer
1941,Dynamic Article: Percutaneous Nerve Evaluation Versus Staged Sacral Nerve Stimulation for Fecal Incontinence.,"Sacral neuromodulation using a 2-staged approach is an established therapy for fecal incontinence. Office-based percutaneous nerve evaluation is a less-invasive alternative to the stage 1 procedure but is seldom used in the evaluation of patients with fecal incontinence.|The aim of this study was to determine the clinical success of percutaneous nerve evaluation versus a staged approach.|This was a retrospective review of a prospectively maintained, single-institution database of patients treated with sacral neuromodulation for fecal incontinence.|This study was conducted at a single academic medical center.|Eighty-six consecutive patients were treated with sacral neuromodulation for fecal incontinence.|Percutaneous nerve evaluation was compared with a staged approach.|The primary outcome measured was the proportion of patients progressing to complete implantation based on >50% improvement in Wexner score during the testing phase.|Percutaneous nerve evaluation was performed in 45 patients, whereas 41 underwent a staged approach. The mean baseline Wexner score did not differ between testing groups. Success was similar between the staged approach and percutaneous nerve evaluation (90.2% versus 82.2%; p = 0.36). The mean 3-month Wexner score was not significantly different between testing methods (4.4 versus 4.1; p = 0.74). However, infection was more likely to occur after the staged approach (10.5% versus 0.0%; p < 0.05).|This study was limited by its retrospective nature and potential for selection bias.|Percutaneous nerve evaluation offers a viable alternative to a staged approach in the evaluation of patients for sacral neuromodulation in the setting of fecal incontinence. Not only are success rates similar, but percutaneous nerve evaluation also has the benefit of limiting patients to 1 operating room visit and has lower rates of infection as compared with the traditional staged approach for sacral neuromodulation.",nonCancer
2530,Booster vaccination against tetanus and diphtheria: insufficient protection against diphtheria in young and elderly adults.,"We have recently demonstrated that single shot vaccinations against tetanus and diphtheria do not lead to long-lasting immunity against diphtheria in elderly persons despite administration at 5 year intervals. In the present study we have immunized a group of young adults against tetanus and diphtheria to compare the pre- and 28 days post-vaccination immune responses in the young group with results of the same vaccination performed in an elderly group of a previous study. We also studied protection in both groups 5 years after vaccination. We compared antibody titers at all three time points and also analyzed the T cell responses in both age groups 5 years after vaccination. Before vaccination 9 % of the elderly persons were not protected against tetanus, and 48 % did not have protection against diphtheria. In the young group all participants were protected against tetanus, but 52 % were also unprotected against diphtheria before vaccination. 28 days after vaccination 100 % of all participants had protective antibody concentrations against tetanus and only a small percentage in each age group (<10 %) was unprotected against diphtheria. 5 years later, 100 % of both cohorts were still protected against tetanus, but 24 % of the young and 54 % of the elderly group were unprotected against diphtheria. Antibody concentrations against diphtheria measured by ELISA correlated well with their neutralizing capacity. T cell responses to tetanus and diphtheria did not differ between young and old persons. We conclude that booster vaccinations against tetanus and diphtheria according to present recommendations provide long-lasting protection only against tetanus, but not against diphtheria, independently of age. In elderly persons, the level of protection is even lower, probably due to intrinsic age-related changes within the immune system and/or insufficient vaccination earlier in life.",nonCancer
2303,Transcriptional activation of muscle atrophy promotes cardiac muscle remodeling during mammalian hibernation.,"Background. Mammalian hibernation in thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) is characterized by dramatic changes on a physiological and molecular level. During hibernation, mammalian hearts show a propensity to hypertrophy due to the need for increasing contractility to pump colder and more viscous blood. While cardiac hypertrophy is quite often a process characterized by decompensation, the ground squirrel studied is an excellent model of cardiac plasticity and cardioprotection under conditions of hypothermia and ischemia. The forkhead box O (Foxo) family of proteins and myogenin (MyoG) are transcription factors that control protein degradation and muscle atrophy by regulating the expression of the E3 ubiquitin ligases, MAFbx and MuRF1. These ligases are part of the ubiquitin proteasome system by transferring ubiquitin to proteins and targeting these proteins for degradation. Regulation of Foxo1 and 3a occurs through phosphorylation at different residues. The threonine-24 (Thr-24) and serine-319 (Ser-319) residues on Foxo1, and the Thr-32 residue on Foxo3a are phosphorylated by Akt, leading to cytoplasmic localization of Foxo. We propose that the described mechanism contributes to the changes taking place in cardiac muscle throughout hibernation. Methods. Total and phosphorylated protein levels of Foxo1 and Foxo3a, as well as total protein levels of MyoG, MAFbx, and MuRF1, were studied using immunoblotting. Results. Immunoblotting results demonstrated upregulations in Foxo1 and Foxo3a total protein levels (1.3- and 4.5-fold increases relative to euthermic control, for Foxo1 and 3a respectively) during late torpor, and protein levels remained elevated throughout the rest of torpor and at interbout arousal. We also observed decreases in inactive, phosphorylated Foxo1 and 3a proteins during throughout torpor, where levels of p-Foxo1 Ser(319) and Thr(24), as well as p-Foxo3a Thr(32) decreased by at least 45% throughout torpor. MyoG was upregulated only during late torpor by 2.4-fold. Protein levels of MAFbx and MuRF1 increased in late torpor as well as during early arousal by as much as 2.8-fold, and MAFbx levels remained elevated during interbout arousal, whereas MuRF1 levels returned to control levels. Discussion. The present results indicate that upregulation and activation of Foxo1 and 3a, in addition to the increase in MyoG levels at late torpor, may be upregulating the expression of MAFbx and MuRF1. These findings suggest that there is activation of the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) as ground squirrels arouse from torpor. Therefore, the signalling pathway involving MyoG, and the E3 ligases MAFbx and MuRF1, plays a significant role in cardiac muscle remodelling during hibernation. These findings provide insights into the regulation of protein degradation and turnover in the cardiac muscle of a hibernator model.",nonCancer
2056,Structure-Based Prediction of Protein-Folding Transition Paths.,"We propose a general theory to describe the distribution of protein-folding transition paths. We show that transition paths follow a predictable sequence of high-free-energy transient states that are separated by free-energy barriers. Each transient state corresponds to the assembly of one or more discrete, cooperative units, which are determined directly from the native structure. We show that the transition state on a folding pathway is reached when a small number of critical contacts are formed between a specific set of substructures, after which folding proceeds downhill in free energy. This approach suggests a natural resolution for distinguishing parallel folding pathways and provides a simple means to predict the rate-limiting step in a folding reaction. Our theory identifies a common folding mechanism for proteins with diverse native structures and establishes general principles for the self-assembly of polymers with specific interactions.",nonCancer
487,Insulin-like growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) exclusive nuclear staining: a predictive biomarker for IGF-1R monoclonal antibody (Ab) therapy in sarcomas.,"A minority of patients with advanced sarcoma achieve prolonged progression free survival (PFS) with insulin growth factor type 1 receptor (IGF-1R) monoclonal antibody (Ab) therapy. A biomarker identifying those patients beforehand would be useful to select patients for the development of these agents. This single centre series includes patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue sarcomas (STS), Ewing sarcoma (ES) and osteosarcoma treated with IGF-1R Ab (R1507, IMC-A12, SCH 717454 and CP-751.871) in the Centre Léon Bérard. Tumour samples were analysed by immunohistochemistry for expression of IGF-1R, insulin-like growth factor binding protein type 3 (IGFBP-3), Ki67, epidermal growth factor receptor (HER1) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Predictive factors for PFS and overall survival (OS) were investigated. All tumour samples had a positive IGF-1R immunostaining on 60% to 100% of tumour cells. IGFBP-3 immunostaining was observed in 12 (75%) samples with 5% to 100% of positive cells. IGF-1R immunostaining was nuclear (n=9, 56%), cytoplasmic (n=4, 25%), or nuclear +cytoplasmic (n=3, 19%). Neither IGFBP-3 expression, nor Ki67 was correlated to PFS. HER2 and HER1 staining were positive in 0 and 2 samples respectively (both primary resistant to IGF-1R Ab therapy). Exclusive intra-nuclear immunoreactivity for IGF-1R was significantly associated with a better PFS (p=0.01) and OS (p=0.007). Exclusive nuclear localisation of IGF-1R is an easily testable biomarker associated with a better PFS and OS for patients treated with IGF-1R Ab therapy. Nuclear localisation of IGF-1R in tumour cells might be a hallmark of pathway activation.",cancer
528,Serum Human Epidermal Growth Factor 2 Extracellular Domain as a Predictive Biomarker for Lapatinib Treatment Efficacy in Patients With Advanced Breast Cancer.,"We examined the prognostic and predictive value of serum human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) extracellular domain (sHER2) in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with lapatinib using data from three randomized trials. We analyzed sHER2 and tissue HER2 (tHER2) data from 1,902 patients (84%) who were randomly assigned to receive lapatinib or control in the trials EGF30001, EGF30008, and EGF100151. Cox regression analyses were performed to correlate both biomarkers with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Median sHER2 levels were 25.1 and 10.1 ng/mL in tHER2-amplified (tHER-positive) and nonamplified (tHER-negative) populations, respectively (r = 0.42 for sHER2-tHER2 correlation). Lapatinib had significant PFS benefit over control (hazard ratio [HR], 0.855; P = .004), but not OS (HR, 0.941; P = .33). Lapatinib PFS benefit is independently predicted by higher sHER2 values (HR per 10-ng/mL increase in sHER2: lapatinib-containing therapies, 1.009 v nonlapatinib-containing therapies, 1.044; P(interaction) < .001) and by positive tHER2 (HR [lapatinib v nonlapatinib]: tHER2 positive, 0.638 v tHER2 negative, 0.940; P(interaction) = .001). Within the tHER2-positive subpopulation (n = 515), higher sHER2 values still independently predicted lapatinib PFS benefit (HR per 10-ng/mL increase in sHER2: lapatinib-containing therapies, 1.017 v nonlapatinib-containing therapies, 1.041; P(interaction) = .008). In control arms (n = 936), higher sHER2 was associated with worse prognosis in multivariable analyses (PFS HR per 10 ng/mL: PFS, 1.024; P < .001; and OS, 1.018; P < .001). Higher sHER2 predicts greater PFS benefit with lapatinib independent of tHER2 status. High sHER2 is also independently prognostic for worse survival in patients who received nonlapatinib-containing therapies. The predictive role of sHER2 for other anti-HER2 agents requires further research.",cancer
2001,(1)H-NMR based metabolomics study for the detection of the human urine metabolic profile effects of Origanum dictamnus tea ingestion.,"(1)H NMR spectroscopy was employed to investigate the repercussion of Origanum dictamnus tea ingestion in several volunteers' urine metabolic profiles, among them two with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), mild IBD and Crohn's disease. Herein, we demonstrate that the concentrations of a lot of urinary metabolites such as hippurate, trimethylamine oxide (TMAO), citrate, and creatinine are altered, which prompts the intestinal microflora function/content perturbation as well as kidney function regulation by dictamnus tea. Interestingly, our preliminary results showed that a high dose of dictamnus tea intake appeared to be toxic for a person with Crohn's disease, since it caused high endogenous ethanol excretion in urine. All subjects' metabolic effects caused by the dictamnus tea appeared to be reversible, when all volunteers stopped its consumption. Finally, we highlight that individuals' metabolic phenotype is reflected in their urine biofluid before and after the dictamnus tea effect while all individuals have some common and different metabolic responses to this tea, implying that each phenotype has a quite different response to this tea consumption.",nonCancer

A specific questionnaire has been developed and validated in the English language: the vitiligo-specific quality-of-life instrument (VitiQoL). The instrument was translated, culturally adapted and validated into Brazilian Portuguese (VitiQoL-PB).|The aim of this study was to assess the QoL in adult patients through the VitiQoL and Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and in pediatric patients through the Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) in a sample of patients with vitiligo.|Subjects were selected from a dermatological outpatient clinic and from a private practice in Porto Alegre. The QoL of pediatric patients was evaluated using the CDLQI questionnaire. In adult patients we used the VitiQoL-PB and the DLQI.|A strong correlation between the scores of the total VitiQoL and DLQI was observed (r = 0.81; p < 0.001). The factor that most contributed to the final score of VitiQoL was stigma. In our sample, women had higher scores than men (p < 0.05). Psychiatric problems were associated with lower QoL. In the pediatric population, the median score of the CDLQI was 3 (interquartile range 1.3-7.3). There was a statistically significant correlation between the child's age and the CDLQI score (rs = 0.41, p = 0.044).|This study confirms that the VitiQoL is easy to administer and adds important information about the impact of vitiligo on a South American population.

All-electron density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out using the four-component Dirac-Coulomb (DC) Hamiltonian, including scalar and spin-orbit (SO) relativistic effects. Fully relativistic values of the magnetically induced ring currents were obtained by numerical integration over the current flow. These values were compared to the spin-free (SO interaction switched off) and non-relativistic values, in order to assess the corresponding contributions to aromaticity. It was found that in C6I6 and C6At6 there is a strong SO influence, in line with the expected relativistic effects of the heavy elements, iodine and astatine.",nonCancer
977,Durable tumor regression in genetically altered malignant rhabdoid tumors by inhibition of methyltransferase EZH2.,"Inactivation of the switch/sucrose nonfermentable complex component SMARCB1 is extremely prevalent in pediatric malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRTs) or atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors. This alteration is hypothesized to confer oncogenic dependency on EZH2 in these cancers. We report the discovery of a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity, (N-((4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)methyl)-5-(ethyl(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)amino)-4-methyl-4'-(morpholinomethyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carboxamide). The compound induces apoptosis and differentiation specifically in SMARCB1-deleted MRT cells. Treatment of xenograft-bearing mice with (N-((4,6-dimethyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydropyridin-3-yl)methyl)-5-(ethyl(tetrahydro-2H-pyran-4-yl)amino)-4-methyl-4'-(morpholinomethyl)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-3-carboxamide) leads to dose-dependent regression of MRTs with correlative diminution of intratumoral trimethylation levels of lysine 27 on histone H3, and prevention of tumor regrowth after dosing cessation. These data demonstrate the dependency of SMARCB1 mutant MRTs on EZH2 enzymatic activity and portend the utility of EZH2-targeted drugs for the treatment of these genetically defined cancers.",cancer
1534,Pre-incubation with cyclosporine a potentiates its inhibitory effects on pitavastatin uptake mediated by recombinantly expressed cynomolgus monkey hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptide.,"Cyclosporine A, an inhibitor of hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs), has reportedly increased plasma concentrations of probe substrates, although its maximum unbound blood concentrations were lower than its experimental half-maximal inhibitory (IC50 ) concentrations. Pre-incubation with cyclosporine A in vitro before simultaneous incubation with probes has been reported to potentiate its inhibitory effects on recombinant human OATP-mediated probe uptake. In the present study, effects of cyclosporine A and rifampicin on recombinant cynomolgus monkey OATP-mediated pitavastatin uptake were investigated in pre- and simultaneous incubation systems. Pre-incubation with cyclosporine A, but not with rifampicin, decreased its apparent IC50 values on recombinant cynomolgus monkey OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated pitavastatin uptake. Application of the co-incubated IC50 values toward R values (1 + [unbound inhibitor]inlet to the liver, theoretically maximum /inhibition constant) in static models, 1.1 in monkeys and 1.3 in humans, for recombinant cynomolgus monkey and human OATP1B1-mediated pitavastatin uptake might result in poor prediction of drug interaction magnitudes. In contrast, the lowered IC50 values after pre-incubation with cyclosporine A provided better prediction with R values of 3.9 for monkeys and 2.7 for humans when estimated maximum cyclosporine A concentrations at the inlet to the liver were used. These results suggest that the enhanced inhibitory potential of perpetrator medicines by pre-incubation on cynomolgus monkey OATP-mediated pitavastatin uptake in vitro could be of value for precise estimation of drug interaction magnitudes in silico, in accordance with the findings from pre-administration of inhibitors on pitavastatin pharmacokinetics validated in monkeys.

116,Sorafenib treatment of FLT3-ITD(+) acute myeloid leukemia: favorable initial outcome and mechanisms of subsequent nonresponsiveness associated with the emergence of a D835 mutation.,"Internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the fms-related tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) gene occurs in 30% of acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) and confers a poor prognosis. Thirteen relapsed or chemo-refractory FLT3-ITD(+) AML patients were treated with sorafenib (200-400 mg twice daily). Twelve patients showed clearance or near clearance of bone marrow myeloblasts after 27 (range 21-84) days with evidence of differentiation of leukemia cells. The sorafenib response was lost in most patients after 72 (range 54-287) days but the FLT3 and downstream effectors remained suppressed. Gene expression profiling showed that leukemia cells that have become sorafenib resistant expressed several genes including ALDH1A1, JAK3, and MMP15, whose functions were unknown in AML. Nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice transplanted with leukemia cells from patients before and during sorafenib resistance recapitulated the clinical results. Both ITD and tyrosine kinase domain mutations at D835 were identified in leukemia initiating cells (LICs) from samples before sorafenib treatment. LICs bearing the D835 mutant have expanded during sorafenib treatment and dominated during the subsequent clinical resistance. These results suggest that sorafenib have selected more aggressive sorafenib-resistant subclones carrying both FLT3-ITD and D835 mutations, and might provide important leads to further improvement of treatment outcome with FLT3 inhibitors.",cancer
1360,Romania: Health System Review.,"This analysis of the Romanian health system reviews recent developments in organization and governance, health financing, health care provision, health reforms and health system performance. The Romanian health care system is a social health insurance system that has remained highly centralized despite recent efforts to decentralize some regulatory functions. It provides a comprehensive benefits package to the 85% of the population that is covered, with the remaining population having access to a minimum package of benefits. While every insured person has access to the same health care benefits regardless of their socioeconomic situation, there are inequities in access to health care across many dimensions, such as rural versus urban, and health outcomes also differ across these dimensions. The Romanian population has seen increasing life expectancy and declining mortality rates but both remain among the worst in the European Union. Some unfavourable trends have been observed, including increasing numbers of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses and falling immunization rates. Public sources account for over 80% of total health financing. However, that leaves considerable out-of-pocket payments covering almost a fifth of total expenditure. The share of informal payments also seems to be substantial, but precise figures are unknown. In 2014, Romania had the lowest health expenditure as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) among the EU Member States. In line with the government's objective of strengthening the role of primary care, the total number of hospital beds has been decreasing. However, health care provision remains characterized by underprovision of primary and community care and inappropriate use of inpatient and specialized outpatient care, including care in hospital emergency departments. The numbers of physicians and nurses are relatively low in Romania compared to EU averages. This has mainly been attributed to the high rates of workers emigrating abroad over the past decade, exacerbated by Romania's EU accession and the reduction of public sector salaries due to the economic crisis. Reform in the Romanian health system has been both constant and yet frequently ineffective, due in part to the high degree of political instability. Recent reforms have focused mainly on introducing cost-saving measures, for example, by attempting to shift some of the health care costs to drug manufacturers by claw-back and to the population through co-payments, and on improving the monitoring of health care expenditure.",nonCancer
1519,Denitrification in a low temperature bioreactor system at two different hydraulic residence times: Laboratory column studies.,"Nitrate removal rates in a mixture of pine woodchips and sewage sludge were determined in a controlled laboratory environment (column studies) at 5°C, 12°C and 22°C, and at two different hydraulic residence times (HRT; 58.2-64.0 hours, and 18.7-20.6 hours), with the objective of providing guidelines for the construction of a field-scale denitrifying woodchip bioreactor for removing nitrate from water at low temperatures (5°C). Baffles installed in the flow path were tested as a measure to reduce preferential flow behavior, and to increase the nitrate removal in the columns. The nitrate removal in the columns was simulated at 5°C and 12°C using a combined Arrhenius-Monod equation controlling the removal rate, and a first-order exchange model for incorporation of stagnant zones. The study concludes that denitrification in the mixture of pine woodchips and sewage sludge reduces nitrate concentrations of 30 mg N L(-1) at 5°C to below detection limits at a high HRT of 58.2-64.0 hours. At a low HRT of 18.7-20.6 hours, nitrate removal was incomplete. The baffles had no observable effect on the nitrate removal in the columns. The Arrhenius frequency factor and activation energy retrieved from the low HRT data suggested a biochemically-controlled reaction rate; the same parameters, however, could not be used to simulate the nitrate removal at high HRT, indicating a change in the rate-controlling kinetics of nitrate removal. The results shows an inversely proportional relationship between the advection velocity and the nitrate removal rate, suggesting that bioreactor performance could be enhanced by promoting low advection velocities.",nonCancer
2389,A Rare Differential Diagnosis of a Solitary Anterior Neck Mass.,"Patients with anterior neck masses commonly present to otorhinolaryngology clinics, but there are limited differential diagnoses for such lesions. Common ones include thyroid nodule and thyroglossal duct cyst. In an elderly patient, a differentiated thyroid carcinoma should be suspected especially if it moves with swallowing. We encountered a typical presentation of a solitary thyroid nodule-like mass with the exception of pulsation in a 65-year-old female. Further investigation, using neck ultrasonography, revealed that it was a variant of right common carotid artery arising from the left common carotid artery. Knowledge of such variants is of great importance as ignorance of such a variation may lead to inadvertent surgical complications during procedures.",nonCancer

448,Low ATM protein expression and depletion of p53 correlates with olaparib sensitivity in gastric cancer cell lines.,"Small-molecule inhibitors of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) have shown considerable promise in the treatment of homologous recombination (HR)-defective tumors, such as BRCA1- and BRCA2-deficient breast and ovarian cancers. We previously reported that mantle cell lymphoma cells with deficiency in ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) are sensitive to PARP-1 inhibitors in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report that PARP inhibitors can potentially target ATM deficiency arising in a solid malignancy. We show that ATM protein expression varies between gastric cancer cell lines, with NUGC4 having significantly reduced protein levels. Significant correlation was found between ATM protein expression and sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, with NUGC4 being the most sensitive. Moreover, reducing ATM kinase activity using a small-molecule inhibitor (KU55933) or shRNA-mediated depletion of ATM protein enhanced olaparib sensitivity in gastric cancer cell lines with depletion or inactivation of p53. Our results demonstrate that ATM is a potential predictive biomarker for PARP-1 inhibitor activity in gastric cancer harboring disruption of p53, and that combined inhibition of ATM and PARP-1 is a rational strategy for expanding the utility of PARP-1 inhibitors to gastric cancer with p53 disruption.",cancer
1928,Mertk on tumor macrophages is a therapeutic target to prevent tumor recurrence following radiation therapy.,"Radiation therapy provides a means to kill large numbers of cancer cells in a controlled location resulting in the release of tumor-specific antigens and endogenous adjuvants. However, by activating pathways involved in apoptotic cell recognition and phagocytosis, irradiated cancer cells engender suppressive phenotypes in macrophages. We demonstrate that the macrophage-specific phagocytic receptor, Mertk is upregulated in macrophages in the tumor following radiation therapy. Ligation of Mertk on macrophages results in anti-inflammatory cytokine responses via NF-kB p50 upregulation, which in turn limits tumor control following radiation therapy. We demonstrate that in immunogenic tumors, loss of Mertk is sufficient to permit tumor cure following radiation therapy. However, in poorly immunogenic tumors, TGFβ inhibition is also required to result in tumor cure following radiation therapy. These data demonstrate that Mertk is a highly specific target whose absence permits tumor control in combination with radiation therapy.",nonCancer
2283,Agricultural land-use change in a Mexican oligotrophic desert depletes ecosystem stability.,"Global demand for food has led to increased land-use change, particularly in dry land ecosystems, which has caused several environmental problems due to the soil degradation. In the Cuatro Cienegas Basin (CCB), alfalfa production irrigated by flooding impacts strongly on the soil.|In order to analyze the effect of such agricultural land-use change on soil nutrient dynamics and soil bacterial community composition, this work examined an agricultural gradient within the CCB which was comprised of a native desert grassland, a plot currently cultivated with alfalfa and a former agricultural field that had been abandoned for over 30 years. For each site, we analyzed C, N and P dynamic fractions, the activity of the enzyme phosphatase and the bacterial composition obtained using 16S rRNA clone libraries.|The results showed that the cultivated site presented a greater availability of water and dissolved organic carbon, these conditions promoted mineralization processes mediated by heterotrophic microorganisms, while the abandoned land was limited by water and dissolved organic nitrogen. The low amount of dissolved organic matter promoted nitrification, which is mediated by autotrophic microorganisms. The microbial N immobilization process and specific phosphatase activity were both favored in the native grassland. As expected, differences in bacterial taxonomical composition were observed among sites. The abandoned site exhibited similar compositions than native grassland, while the cultivated site differed.|The results suggest that the transformation of native grassland into agricultural land induces drastic changes in soil nutrient dynamics as well as in the bacterial community. However, with the absence of agricultural practices, some of the soil characteristics analyzed slowly recovers their natural state.",nonCancer
2059,Biased Allostery.,"G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute a large group of integral membrane proteins that transduce extracellular signals from a wide range of agonists into targeted intracellular responses. Although the responses can vary depending on the category of G-proteins activated by a particular receptor, responses were also found to be triggered by interactions of the receptor with β-arrestins. It was subsequently discovered that for the same receptor molecule (e.g., the β-adrenergic receptor), some agonists have a propensity to specifically favor responses by G-proteins, others by β-arrestins, as has now been extensively studied. This feature of the GPCR system is known as biased agonism and is subject to various interpretations, including agonist-induced conformational change versus selective stabilization of preexisting active conformations. Here, we explore a complete allosteric framework for biased agonism based on alternative preexisting conformations that bind more strongly, but nonexclusively, either G-proteins or β-arrestins. The framework incorporates reciprocal effects among all interacting molecules. As a result, G-proteins and β-arrestins are in steric competition for binding to the cytoplasmic surface of either the G-protein-favoring or β-arrestin-favoring GPCR conformation. Moreover, through linkage relations, the strength of the interactions of G-proteins or β-arrestins with the corresponding active conformation potentiates the apparent affinity for the agonist, effectively equating these two proteins to allosteric modulators. The balance between response alternatives can also be influenced by the physiological concentrations of either G-proteins or β-arrestins, as well as by phosphorylation or interactions with positive or negative allosteric modulators. The nature of the interactions in the simulations presented suggests novel experimental tests to distinguish more fully among alternative mechanisms.",nonCancer

Pre- and postinterventional lung function parameters, the 6-min walking test (6-MWT) distance, adverse events, and follow-up were recorded.|In 20 patients, there was an overall improvement in lung function with an increase in FEV1 (16.97-21.03% of pred.) and a decrease in residual volume (322-270% of pred.) and total lung capacity (144-129.06% of pred.). The 6-MWT distance improved (from 239 ± 77 to 267± 97 m overall, and from 184 ± 50 to 237 ± 101 m if patients developed an atelectasis of the target lobe). Pneumothorax occurred in 5 of the 20 patients (25%). 30-day mortality was 0%, and all patients survived to discharge.|The patients benefitted moderately from EBV treatment despite an initially low FEV1.

2189,Iodine Anions beyond -1: Formation of LinI (n = 2-5) and Its Interaction with Quasiatoms.,"Novel phases of LinI (n = 2, 3, 4, 5) compounds are predicted to form under high pressure using first-principles density functional theory and an unbiased crystal structure search algorithm. All of the phases identified are thermodynamically stable with respect to decomposition into elemental Li and the binary LiI at a relatively low pressure (≈20 GPa). Increasing the pressure to 100 GPa yields the formation of a high pressure electride where electrons occupy interstitial quasiatom (ISQ) orbitals. Under these extreme pressures, the calculated charge on iodine suggests the oxidation state goes beyond the conventional and expected -1 charge for the halogens. This strange oxidative behavior stems from an electron transfer going from the ISQ to I(-) and Li(+) ions as high pressure collapses the void space. The resulting interplay between chemical bonding and the quantum chemical nature of enclosed interstitial space allows this first report of a halogen anion beyond a -1 oxidation state.",nonCancer
392,Targeting Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor (FGFR) with BGJ398 in a Gastric Cancer Model.,"To assess the efficacy of targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) with the pan-FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 in a gastric cancer (GC) model. Expression of FGFRs was determined in GC cell lines (KKLS, MKN-45, TMK-1). Impact of the FGFR inhibitor BGJ398 on growth, motility, signaling, expression of transcription factors and secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) was determined in vitro. Results were validated in subcutaneous tumor models. In vitro, FGFR inhibition was most effective in KKLS cells (high FGFR1, FGFR2IIIc, no FGFR2IIIb expression) with inhibition of growth, motility, signaling, c-MYC expression and VEGFA secretion. BGJ398 showed some activity in MKN-45 cells (intermediate FGFR1, high FGFR2IIIb, low FGFR2IIIc expression), while TMK-1 cells (low FGFR1, no FGFR2IIIb and FGFR2IIIc expression) did not respond. Results were confirmed in vivo with strongest efficacy on growth in KKLS tumors and only minor impairment of TMK-1 lesions. Efficacy of FGFR inhibition is dependent on FGFR1 and FGFR2IIIc expression in GC models.",cancer
290,A Variant in a MicroRNA complementary site in the 3' UTR of the KIT oncogene increases risk of acral melanoma.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small ∼22nt single stranded RNAs that negatively regulate protein expression by binding to partially complementary sequences in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTRs) of target gene messenger RNAs (mRNA). Recently, mutations have been identified in both miRNAs and target genes that disrupt regulatory relationships, contribute to oncogenesis and serve as biomarkers for cancer risk. KIT, an established oncogene with a multifaceted role in melanogenesis and melanoma pathogenesis, has recently been shown to be upregulated in some melanomas, and is also a target of the miRNA miR-221. Here, we describe a genetic variant in the 3' UTR of the KIT oncogene that correlates with a greater than fourfold increased risk of acral melanoma. This KIT variant results in a mismatch in the seed region of a miR-221 complementary site and reporter data suggests that this mismatch can result in increased expression of the KIT oncogene. Consistent with the hypothesis that this is a functional variant, KIT mRNA and protein levels are both increased in the majority of samples harboring the KIT variant. This work identifies a novel genetic marker for increased heritable risk of melanoma.",cancer
161,Genetic and molecular pathogenesis of mantle cell lymphoma: perspectives for new targeted therapeutics.,Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a well-defined lymphoid malignancy characterized by a rapid clinical evolution and poor response to current therapeutic protocols. The genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis combine the dysregulation of cell proliferation and survival pathways with a high level of chromosome instability that seems related to the disruption of the DNA damage response pathway. Understanding these mechanisms and how they affect tumour behaviour is providing the rationale for the identification of reliable predictors of clinical evolution and the design of innovative therapeutic strategies that could open new avenues for the treatment of patients with MCL.,cancer
1204,Functional analyses and molecular modeling of two c-Kit mutations responsible for imatinib secondary resistance in GIST patients.,"Imatinib-acquired resistance related to the presence of secondary point mutations has become a frequent event in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Here, transient transfection experiments with plasmids carrying two different KIT-acquired point mutations were performed along with immunoprecipitation of total protein extracts, derived from imatinib-treated and untreated cells. The molecular mechanics/Poisson Boltzmann surface area computational techniques were applied to study the interactions of the wild-type and mutated receptors with imatinib at the molecular level. Biochemical analyses showed KIT phosphorylation in cells transfected with vectors carrying the specific mutant genes. Imatinib treatment demonstrated that T670I was insensitive to the drug at all the applied concentrations, whereas V654A was inhibited by 6 microM of imatinib. The modeling of the mutated receptors revealed that both substitutions affect imatinib-binding site, but to a different extent: T670I substantially modifies the binding pocket, whereas V654A induces only relatively confined structural changes. We demonstrated that T670I and V654A cause indeed imatinib-acquired resistance and that the former is more resistant to imatinib than the latter. The application of molecular simulations allowed us to quantify the interactions between the mutated receptors and imatinib, and to propose a molecular rationale for this type of drug resistance.",cancer
2398,Effect of Phenobarbital on Nitric Oxide Level in Term Newborn Infants with Perinatal Asphyxia.,"Perinatal asphyxia (PA) is very significant in perinatal medicine due to the involvement of the central nervous system.

The case group received 20 mg/kg intravenous phenobarbital within six hours of birth, and the control group did not receive phenobarbital. Serum concentrations of nitric oxide (NO) were measured at enrollment and one week after birth in the two groups. Clinical, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging findings of the two groups were compared.|At enrollment, the two groups did not differ in clinical severity, seizure incidence, or NO concentration. After one week, NO concentration was significantly lower in the case group (p < 0.050), but there was no significant difference in other variables between the two groups.|Early administration of phenobarbital in term neonates with PA could protect them against encephalopathy.",nonCancer
914,"Comprehensive, Integrative Genomic Analysis of Diffuse Lower-Grade Gliomas.","Diffuse low-grade and intermediate-grade gliomas (which together make up the lower-grade gliomas, World Health Organization grades II and III) have highly variable clinical behavior that is not adequately predicted on the basis of histologic class. Some are indolent; others quickly progress to glioblastoma. The uncertainty is compounded by interobserver variability in histologic diagnosis. Mutations in IDH, TP53, and ATRX and codeletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) have been implicated as clinically relevant markers of lower-grade gliomas. We performed genomewide analyses of 293 lower-grade gliomas from adults, incorporating exome sequence, DNA copy number, DNA methylation, messenger RNA expression, microRNA expression, and targeted protein expression. These data were integrated and tested for correlation with clinical outcomes. Unsupervised clustering of mutations and data from RNA, DNA-copy-number, and DNA-methylation platforms uncovered concordant classification of three robust, nonoverlapping, prognostically significant subtypes of lower-grade glioma that were captured more accurately by IDH, 1p/19q, and TP53 status than by histologic class. Patients who had lower-grade gliomas with an IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion had the most favorable clinical outcomes. Their gliomas harbored mutations in CIC, FUBP1, NOTCH1, and the TERT promoter. Nearly all lower-grade gliomas with IDH mutations and no 1p/19q codeletion had mutations in TP53 (94%) and ATRX inactivation (86%). The large majority of lower-grade gliomas without an IDH mutation had genomic aberrations and clinical behavior strikingly similar to those found in primary glioblastoma. The integration of genomewide data from multiple platforms delineated three molecular classes of lower-grade gliomas that were more concordant with IDH, 1p/19q, and TP53 status than with histologic class. Lower-grade gliomas with an IDH mutation either had 1p/19q codeletion or carried a TP53 mutation. Most lower-grade gliomas without an IDH mutation were molecularly and clinically similar to glioblastoma. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health.).",cancer
467,Thymidylate synthase gene copy number as a predictive marker for response to pemetrexed treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.,"Pemetrexed is a key drug for therapy of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a search for biomarkers for study of the efficacy of pemetrexed treatment, we examined the thymidylate synthase (TYMS) copy number in NSCLC cell lines and in clinical NSCLC samples treated with pemetrexed, combined with platinum drugs. TYMS copy numbers in lung adenocarcinoma cell lines were significantly lower than in squamous cell carcinoma (p=0.0105), and a significant correlation was found between the TYMS copy number and the 50% inhibitory concentration value for pemetrexed in all 17 lung cancer cell lines tested (r=0.6814, p=0.0026). Moreover, TYMS copy number was significantly lower in clinical NSCLC samples responsive to treatment with pemetrexed combined with platinum drugs (p=0.0067). Furthermore, the decrease in the baseline CT size measurement of pemetrexed combined with platinum drug treatment correlated significantly with TYMS copy number (r=0.7967, p=0.0011). To our knowledge, this is the first report of a significant association between TYMS copy number and response to pemetrexed treatment in tumor biopsy specimens. Our results suggest that TYMS copy number could be a predictive biomarker for pemetrexed based chemotherapy.",cancer
891,Prognostic value of Ki-67 for prostate cancer death in a conservatively managed cohort.,"Standard clinical parameters cannot accurately differentiate indolent from aggressive prostate cancer. Our previous work showed that immunohistochemical (IHC) Ki-67 improved prediction of prostate cancer death in a cohort of conservatively treated clinically localised prostate cancers diagnosed by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Here, we present results in a more clinically relevant needle biopsy cohort. Biopsy specimens were microarrayed. The percentage of Ki-67 positively stained malignant cells per core was measured and the maximum score per individual used in analysis of time to death from prostate cancer using a Cox proportional hazards model. In univariate analysis (n=293), the hazard ratio (HR) (95% confidence intervals) for dichotomous Ki-67 (≤ 10%, >10%) was 3.42 (1.76, 6.62) χ(2) (1 df)=9.8, P=0.002. In multivariate analysis, Ki-67 added significant predictive information to that provided by Gleason score and prostate-specific antigen (HR=2.78 (1.42, 5.46), χ(2) (1 df)=7.0, P=0.008). The IHC Ki-67 scoring on prostate needle biopsies is practicable and yielded significant prognostic information. It was less informative than in the previous TURP cohort where tumour samples were larger and more comprehensive, but in more contemporary cohorts with larger numbers of biopsies per patient, Ki-67 may prove a more powerful biomarker.",cancer
259,DNAJB1-PRKACA is specific for fibrolamellar carcinoma.,"Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a distinct subtype of hepatocellular carcinoma that predominantly affects young patients without underlying cirrhosis. A recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion has recently been reported in fibrolamellar carcinomas. To determine the specificity of this fusion and to develop routinely available clinical methods of detection, we developed an RT-PCR assay for paraffin-embedded tissues and a FISH probe for detection of the rearrangements of the PRKACA locus. We also developed an RNA in situ hybridization assay to assess expression levels of the total chimeric transcript and wild-type transcripts. A total of 106 primary liver tumors were studied by RT-PCR, including 26 fibrolamellar carcinomas (4 of which were metastases to the abdominal wall or lymph nodes), 25 conventional hepatocellular carcinomas, 25 cholangiocarcinomas, 25 hepatic adenomas, and 5 hepatoblastomas. RT-PCR was successful in 92% of tested fibrolamellar carcinoma cases (24/26) and the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was found in all fibrolamellar carcinomas but not in other tumor types. FISH was tested in 19 fibrolamellar carcinomas and in 6 scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas, which can closely mimic fibrolamellar carcinoma. Rearrangements of the PRKACA locus was seen in all 19 fibrolamellar carcinoma specimens, but in none of the scirrhous hepatocellular carcinomas. Finally, a RNA in situ hybridization strategy was positive in 7/7 successfully hybridized cases, and showed mRNA over-expression in all of the fibrolamellar carcinomas. In addition, the stromal cells embedded in the characteristic intratumoral fibrosis of fibrolamellar carcinomas and the background liver tissues were negative for the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion by all tested methods. In conclusion, detection of DNAJB1-PRKACA is a very sensitive and specific finding in support of the diagnosis of fibrolamellar carcinoma.",cancer

The first created magnetic MAX phases were predicted through evaluation of phase stability using density functional theory, and subsequently synthesized as heteroepitaxial thin films. All magnetic MAX phases reported to date, in bulk or thin film form, are based on Cr and/or Mn, and they include (Cr,Mn)2AlC, (Cr,Mn)2GeC, (Cr,Mn)2GaC, (Mo,Mn)2GaC, (V,Mn)3GaC2, Cr2AlC, Cr2GeC and Mn2GaC. A variety of magnetic properties have been found, such as ferromagnetic response well above room temperature and structural changes linked to magnetic anisotropy. In this paper, theoretical as well as experimental work performed on these materials to date is critically reviewed, in terms of methods used, results acquired, and conclusions drawn. Open questions concerning magnetic characteristics are discussed, and an outlook focused on new materials, superstructures, property tailoring and further synthesis and characterization is presented.",nonCancer
217,The molecular profile of adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia: mutations in RUNX1 and DNMT3A are associated with poor prognosis in T-ALL.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive and heterogeneous disease. The diagnosis is predominantly based on immunophenotyping. In addition to known cytogenetic abnormalities molecular mutations were recently identified. Here, 90 adult T-ALL cases were investigated for mutations in NOTCH1, FBXW7, PHF6, CDKN2A, DNMT3A, FLT3, PTEN, and RUNX1 using 454 next-generation amplicon sequencing and melting curve analyses. These data were further complemented by FISH, chromosome banding, array CGH, and CDKN2B promoter methylation analyses. NOTCH1 was the most frequently mutated gene with a 71.1% frequency followed by FBXW7 (18.9%), PHF6 (39.5%), DNMT3A (17.8%), RUNX1 (15.5%), PTEN (10.0%), CDKN2A (4.4%), FLT3-ITD (2.2%), and FLT3-TKD (1.1%). In total, 84/90 (93.3%) cases harbored at least one mutation. Combining these data with CDKN2A/B deletions and CDKN2B methylation status, we detected minimum one aberration in 89/90 (98.9%) patients. Survival analyses revealed the subtype as defined by the immunophenotype as the strongest independent prognostic factor. When restricting the survival analysis to the early T-ALL subtype, a strong association of RUNX1 (P = 0.027) and DNMT3A (P = 0.005) mutations with shorter overall survival was observed. In conclusion, RUNX1 and DNMT3A are frequently mutated in T-ALL and are associated with poor prognosis in early T-ALL.",cancer

Significant disabilities rates reflect an accumulation of health risks. Psychiatry disability is one of the most significant disabilities, because it manifests in cognitive, affective, and behavior disorders that limit one's daily life and restrict their participations. Very few studies have explored the 20 years associations between demographic factors and psychiatry disability among older people in China.In this study, we investigated psychiatry disability transitional association behind China rapid development from 1987 to 2006 among the 60 and older population. Data used 2 nationally represented, population-based data from the China National Sample Surveys on Disability, conducted in 1987 and 2006. The sample size of the current study was 140,008 in 1987 and 354,859 in 2006, respectively. Associations between socioeconomic factors and psychiatry disability were determined by using a logistic regression model.The prevalence of psychiatric disabilities increased from 1987 to 2006. In both surveys, the most common psychiatric disabilities were schizophrenia, schizotypal, and delusional disorders, and they presented the same associations with age increase. Socioeconomic inequities, such as current employment status and marital status, were associated with psychiatry disability in both surveys. These associations remained even after these 2 surveys were combined.The rapidly rising prevalence of psychiatric disorders expected warrants strategies to reduce the burden of these disabilities among females and rural residents.",nonCancer
502,Toll-like receptor 9 agonist IMO cooperates with cetuximab in K-ras mutant colorectal and pancreatic cancers.,"K-Ras somatic mutations are a strong predictive biomarker for resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors in patients with colorectal and pancreatic cancer. We previously showed that the novel Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist immunomodulatory oligonucleotide (IMO) has a strong in vivo activity in colorectal cancer models by interfering with EGFR-related signaling and synergizing with the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. In the present study, we investigated, both in vitro and in vivo, the antitumor effect of IMO alone or in combination with cetuximab in subcutaneous colon and orthotopic pancreatic cancer models harboring K-Ras mutations and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. We showed that IMO was able to significantly restore the sensitivity of K-Ras mutant cancer cells to cetuximab, producing a marked inhibition of cell survival and a complete suppression of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphorylation, when used in combination with cetuximab. IMO interfered with EGFR-dependent signaling, modulating the functional interaction between TLR9 and EGFR. In vivo, IMO plus cetuximab combination caused a potent and long-lasting cooperative antitumor activity in LS174T colorectal cancer and in orthotopic AsPC1 pancreatic cancer. The capability of IMO to restore cetuximab sensitivity was further confirmed by using K-Ras mutant colorectal cancer cell models obtained through homologous recombination technology. We showed that IMO markedly inhibits growth of K-Ras mutant colon and pancreatic cancers in vitro and in nude mice and cooperates with cetuximab via multiple mechanisms of action. Therefore, we propose IMO plus cetuximab as a therapeutic strategy for K-Ras wild-type as well for K-Ras mutant, cetuximab-resistant colorectal and pancreatic cancers.",cancer
1385,"Criticism in the Self, Brain, Relationships, and Social Structure: Implications for Psychodynamic Psychiatry.","An integrative-psychodynamic theory of criticism in self and relationships is presented (Shahar, 2015).

Self-criticism, a formidable dimension of vulnerability to a wide array of psychopathologies, is construed as a distorted form of self-knowledge, reducing internal confusion at the expense of widening the gap between A and SK. Amalgamated by a genetic and neuroanatomic makeup, criticism of the self quickly translates into criticism-based interpersonal exchanges across the life span, culminating in an Axis of Criticism (ACRIM). A psychodynamic-integrative psychotherapy of malignant criticism in self and relationships is described. The article is concluded with some broad reflections on the implication of this work to the theory development and therapeutic action.",nonCancer
2481,Reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome associated with late onset postpartum eclampsia: A case report.,"Late onset postpartum eclampsia (LPE) is defined by its onset at >48 h after delivery. Reversible posterior encephalopathy syndrome (RPES) associated with LPE is uncommon, with the majority of RPES cases having a late postpartum onset within 4 weeks after childbirth. The present study reported the case of a 15-year old female presenting with convulsions that began 5 weeks after delivery. A magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain revealed multiple lesions in the cortex, subcortical region and deep white matter of the bilateral cerebellum, and occipital, frontal and parietal lobes. The clinical manifestations and radiological abnormalities were readily resolved subsequent to antihypertension and anticonvulsion treatment. In conclusion, the present rare case indicates that LPE should be considered as a potential diagnosis even at 4 weeks after delivery. Furthermore, clinicians should familiarize with the reversible radioimaging features of RPES, since early recognition and adequate treatment are important to the outcome of patients.",nonCancer
2431,Enhancing chemosensitivity in oral squamous cell carcinoma by lentivirus vector-mediated RNA interference targeting EGFR and MRP2.,"Oral cancer is the eighth most common type of cancer among men worldwide, with an age-standardized rate of 6.3 per 100,000, and is the fourth leading cause of cancer-associated mortality among men in Taiwan. Cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) are two of the most frequently utilized chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of oral cancer. Although oral cancer patients initially benefit from chemotherapy with these drugs, they may develop resistance to them, which worsens their prognosis and reduces survival rates. It has been reported that increased levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) induce drug resistance in numerous types of human cancer. Therefore, the present study employed lentivirus vector-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) in order to target the genes encoding EGFR and MRP2 in the oral squamous cell carcinoma cell line OC2. It was observed that RNAi-mediated downregulation of EGFR or MRP2 increased the sensitivity to 5-FU and cisplatin in OC2 cells. Downregulation of EGFR resulted in significant suppression of OC2 tumor growth following 5-FU administration. However, simultaneous downregulation of the two genes did not further suppress the tumor growth, indicating that MRP2 does not have a significant role in the chemosensitivity of EGFR-downregulated cells to 5-FU. In contrast, downregulation of MRP2 was demonstrated to significantly enhance the therapeutic effects of cisplatin in EGFR-downregulated OC2 tumors. The observation that the expression of MRP2 was positively correlated with the level of cisplatin resistance in cells suggests that RNAi-mediated downregulation of MRP2 may be applicable as a therapeutic approach toward reversing MRP2-dependent cisplatin resistance in oral cancer.",nonCancer
302,LRP1B deletion in high-grade serous ovarian cancers is associated with acquired chemotherapy resistance to liposomal doxorubicin.,"High-grade serous cancer (HGSC), the most common subtype of ovarian cancer, often becomes resistant to chemotherapy, leading to poor patient outcomes. Intratumoral heterogeneity occurs in nearly all solid cancers, including ovarian cancer, contributing to the development of resistance mechanisms. In this study, we examined the spatial and temporal genomic variation in HGSC using high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Multiple metastatic lesions from individual patients were analyzed along with 22 paired pretreatment and posttreatment samples. We documented regions of differential DNA copy number between multiple tumor biopsies that correlated with altered expression of genes involved in cell polarity and adhesion. In the paired primary and relapse cohort, we observed a greater degree of genomic change in tumors from patients that were initially sensitive to chemotherapy and had longer progression-free interval compared with tumors from patients that were resistant to primary chemotherapy. Notably, deletion or downregulation of the lipid transporter LRP1B emerged as a significant correlate of acquired resistance in our analysis. Functional studies showed that reducing LRP1B expression was sufficient to reduce the sensitivity of HGSC cell lines to liposomal doxorubicin, but not to doxorubicin, whereas LRP1B overexpression was sufficient to increase sensitivity to liposomal doxorubicin. Together, our findings underscore the large degree of variation in DNA copy number in spatially and temporally separated tumors in HGSC patients, and they define LRP1B as a potential contributor to the emergence of chemotherapy resistance in these patients.",cancer
28,Clinical impact of DNMT3A mutations in younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia: results of the AML Study Group (AMLSG).,"In this study, we evaluated the frequency and prognostic impact of DNMT3A mutations (DNMT3A(mut)) in 1770 younger adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in the context of other genetic alterations and the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification. DNMT3A(mut) were found in 20.9% of AMLs and were associated with older age (P < .0001), higher white blood cell counts (P < .0001), cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML; P < .0001), NPM1 mutations (P < .0001), FLT3 internal tandem duplications (P < .0001), and IDH1/2 mutations (P < .0001). In univariable and multivariable analyses, DNMT3A(mut) did not impact event-free, relapse-free (RFS), or overall survival (OS) in either the entire cohort or in CN-AML; a negative prognostic effect was found only in the ELN unfavorable CN-AML subset (OS, P = .011). In addition, R882 mutations vs non-R882 mutations showed opposite clinical effects-unfavorable for R882 on RFS (all: hazard ratio [HR], 1.29 [P = .026]; CN-AML: HR, 1.38 [P = .018]) and favorable for non-R882 on OS (all: HR, 0.77 [P = .057]; CN-AML: HR, 0.73 [P = .083]). In our statistically high-powered study with minimized selection bias, DNMT3A(mut) represent a frequent genetic lesion in younger adults with AML but have no significant impact on survival end points; only moderate effects on outcome were found, depending on molecular subgroup and DNMT3A(mut) type.",cancer
1036,Osimertinib or Platinum-Pemetrexed in EGFR T790M-Positive Lung Cancer.,"Background Osimertinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) that is selective for both EGFR-TKI sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. The efficacy of osimertinib as compared with platinum-based therapy plus pemetrexed in such patients is unknown. Methods In this randomized, international, open-label, phase 3 trial, we assigned 419 patients with T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, who had disease progression after first-line EGFR-TKI therapy, in a 2:1 ratio to receive either oral osimertinib (at a dose of 80 mg once daily) or intravenous pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) plus either carboplatin (target area under the curve, 5 [AUC5]) or cisplatin (75 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles; maintenance pemetrexed was allowed. In all the patients, disease had progressed during receipt of first-line EGFR-TKI therapy. The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival. Results The median duration of progression-free survival was significantly longer with osimertinib than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (10.1 months vs. 4.4 months; hazard ratio; 0.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23 to 0.41; P<0.001). The objective response rate was significantly better with osimertinib (71%; 95% CI, 65 to 76) than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (31%; 95% CI, 24 to 40) (odds ratio for objective response, 5.39; 95% CI, 3.47 to 8.48; P<0.001). Among 144 patients with metastases to the central nervous system (CNS), the median duration of progression-free survival was longer among patients receiving osimertinib than among those receiving platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (8.5 months vs. 4.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.49). The proportion of patients with adverse events of grade 3 or higher was lower with osimertinib (23%) than with platinum therapy plus pemetrexed (47%). Conclusions Osimertinib had significantly greater efficacy than platinum therapy plus pemetrexed in patients with T790M-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (including those with CNS metastases) in whom disease had progressed during first-line EGFR-TKI therapy.

427,P21 and CD166 as predictive markers of poor response and outcome after fluorouracil-based chemoradiotherapy for the patients with rectal cancer.,"Pre-operative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) is the standard treatment in clinical stage T3/4 or node positive rectal cancer. However, there are no established biomarkers that can predict the pathological response and clinical outcome to CRT. Immunohistochemical staining was performed in tissue arrays constructed from core tissue specimens taken before treatment and from operative specimens from 112 patients who received 5-FU based pre-operative CRT and surgery. Expression of Ki67, TS, BAX, EpCAM, p53, p21, EGFR, CD44, CD133, CD166, HIF1α and ALDH1 were assessed and correlated with tumor regression grades and disease free survival. Of the 112 patients (M/F 74/38, median age: 62), 20 (17.9%) patients achieved pathologic complete remission (pCR). In analyzing the associations between marker expressions and tumor regression grades, high p21 expression at the pretreatment biopsy was significantly associated with non-pCR (p = 0.022) and poor disease free survival (median DFS - low vs high p21: 75.8 vs 58.1 months, p = 0.002). In the multivariate analysis, high p21 expression level at the pre-treatment biopsy was significantly associated with poor DFS (p = 0.001, HR 6.14; 95% CI 2.03, 18.55). High CD166 expression level at the pretreatment biopsy was also associated with poor DFS (p = 0.003; HR 5.61; 95% CI 1.81, 17.35). These show high p21 and CD166 expression at the pretreatment biopsy were associated with tumor regression and poor prognosis in patients treated with 5-FU based CRT. Larger, prospective and functional studies are warranted to determine the role of p21 and CD166 as predictive biomarker of response to CRT.",cancer
845,"Preclinical pharmacology of AZD5363, an inhibitor of AKT: pharmacodynamics, antitumor activity, and correlation of monotherapy activity with genetic background.","AKT is a key node in the most frequently deregulated signaling network in human cancer. AZD5363, a novel pyrrolopyrimidine-derived compound, inhibited all AKT isoforms with a potency of 10 nmol/L or less and inhibited phosphorylation of AKT substrates in cells with a potency of approximately 0.3 to 0.8 μmol/L. AZD5363 monotherapy inhibited the proliferation of 41 of 182 solid and hematologic tumor cell lines with a potency of 3 μmol/L or less. Cell lines derived from breast cancers showed the highest frequency of sensitivity. There was a significant relationship between the presence of PIK3CA and/or PTEN mutations and sensitivity to AZD5363 and between RAS mutations and resistance. Oral dosing of AZD5363 to nude mice caused dose- and time-dependent reduction of PRAS40, GSK3β, and S6 phosphorylation in BT474c xenografts (PRAS40 phosphorylation EC(50) ~ 0.1 μmol/L total plasma exposure), reversible increases in blood glucose concentrations, and dose-dependent decreases in 2[18F]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG) uptake in U87-MG xenografts. Chronic oral dosing of AZD5363 caused dose-dependent growth inhibition of xenografts derived from various tumor types, including HER2(+) breast cancer models that are resistant to trastuzumab. AZD5363 also significantly enhanced the antitumor activity of docetaxel, lapatinib, and trastuzumab in breast cancer xenografts. It is concluded that AZD5363 is a potent inhibitor of AKT with pharmacodynamic activity in vivo, has potential to treat a range of solid and hematologic tumors as monotherapy or a combinatorial agent, and has potential for personalized medicine based on the genetic status of PIK3CA, PTEN, and RAS. AZD5363 is currently in phase I clinical trials.",cancer
1736,Photochemical reaction patterns on heterostructures of ZnO on periodically poled lithium niobate.,"The internal electric field in LiNbO3 provides a driving force for heterogeneous photocatalytic reactions, where photoexcited holes or electrons can participate in redox reactions on positive (+c) and negative (-c) domain surfaces and at the domain boundaries. One method to characterize the surface chemical reactivity is to measure photoinduced Ag deposition by immersing the LiNbO3 in an aqueous AgNO3 solution and illuminating with above bandgap light. Reduction of Ag+ ions leads to the formation of Ag nanoparticles at the surface, and a high density of Ag nanoparticles indicates enhanced surface photochemical reactions. In this study, an n-type semiconducting ZnO layer is deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (PPLN) to modulate the surface electronic properties and impact the surface redox reactions. After plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) of 1, 2, 4 and 10 nm ZnO thin films on PPLN substrates, the substrates were immersed in aqueous AgNO3 and illuminated with above band gap UV light. The Ag nanoparticle density increased for 1 and 2 nm ZnO/PPLN heterostructures, indicating an enhanced electron density at the ZnO/PPLN surface. However, increasing the ZnO thickness beyond 2 nm resulted in a decrease of the Ag nanoparticle density. The increase in nanoparticle density is related to the photoexcited charge density at the ZnO/PPLN interface and the presence of a weakly adsorbed Stern layer at the ZnO surface. The decrease in the nanoparticle density for thicker ZnO is attributed to photoexcited electron screening in the ZnO layer that suppresses the electron flow from the LiNbO3 to the ZnO surface.",nonCancer
360,Unique genomic profile of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FLC) is a rare primary hepatic cancer that develops in children and young adults without cirrhosis. Little is known about its pathogenesis, and it can be treated only with surgery. We performed an integrative genomic analysis of a large series of patients with FLC to identify associated genetic factors. By using 78 clinically annotated FLC samples, we performed whole-transcriptome (n = 58), single-nucleotide polymorphism array (n = 41), and next-generation sequencing (n = 48) analyses; we also assessed the prevalence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript associated with this cancer (n = 73). We performed class discovery using non-negative matrix factorization, and functional annotation using gene-set enrichment analyses, nearest template prediction, ingenuity pathway analyses, and immunohistochemistry. The genomic identification of significant targets in a cancer algorithm was used to identify chromosomal aberrations, MuTect and VarScan2 were used to identify somatic mutations, and the random survival forest was used to determine patient prognoses. Findings were validated in an independent cohort. Unsupervised gene expression clustering showed 3 robust molecular classes of tumors: the proliferation class (51% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate proliferation and mammalian target of rapamycin signaling activation; the inflammation class (26% of samples) had altered expression of genes that regulate inflammation and cytokine enriched production; and the unannotated class (23% of samples) had a gene expression signature that was not associated previously with liver tumors. Expression of genes that regulate neuroendocrine function, as well as histologic markers of cholangiocytes and hepatocytes, were detected in all 3 classes. FLCs had few copy number variations; the most frequent were focal amplification at 8q24.3 (in 12.5% of samples), and deletions at 19p13 (in 28% of samples) and 22q13.32 (in 25% of samples). The DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript was detected in 79% of samples. FLC samples also contained mutations in cancer-related genes such as BRCA2 (in 4.2% of samples), which are uncommon in liver neoplasms. However, FLCs did not contain mutations most commonly detected in liver cancers. We identified an 8-gene signature that predicted survival of patients with FLC. In a genomic analysis of 78 FLC samples, we identified 3 classes based on gene expression profiles. FLCs contain mutations and chromosomal aberrations not previously associated with liver cancer, and almost 80% contain the DNAJB1-PRKACA fusion transcript. By using this information, we identified a gene signature that is associated with patient survival time.",cancer
2130,"Cancer Disparities in Rural Appalachia: Incidence, Early Detection, and Survivorship.","To document cancer-related health disparities in Appalachia.|The current study investigated disparities in cancer incidence, mortality, and staging between rural Appalachians and those living outside of rural Appalachia. To accomplish this, mortality data for the United States from 1969 to 2011 were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) using SEER(*) Stat. These data were used to compare trends in mortality between rural Appalachians, urban Appalachians, rural non-Appalachians, and urban non-Appalachians. Cancer incidence trends, staging, and survivorship data were compared across regions using the SEER-18 Program, which represented 28% of the US population and includes 2 Appalachian states: Georgia and Kentucky.|Cancer mortality rates declined in all regions, but disparities remained such that rural Appalachia has the highest incidence, while urban non-Appalachia has the lowest. In all but 1 state, rural Appalachians had higher cancer mortality rates than urban non-Appalachians. Cancer incidence declined for all regions except rural Appalachia. Rural Appalachians had lower rates of early stage breast cancer diagnoses than their urban non-Appalachian counterparts. Finally, rural Appalachians had lower 3- and 5-year survival rates than their urban non-Appalachian counterparts.|Rural Appalachians are faced with poorer cancer-related health outcomes across the continuum of cancer care. A systematic effort is needed to reduce the burden of cancer for rural Appalachia. Additional research should explore reasons for the disparities that were observed.",nonCancer

Overall response rate (ORR) was extracted from phase I-III trials investigating nivolumab, pembrolizumab and MPDL3280A for advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and genitourinary cancer, and cumulated by adopting a fixed and random-effect model with 95% confidence interval (CI). Interaction test according to tumor PD-L1 was accomplished. A sensitivity analysis according to adopted drug, tumor type, PD-L1 cut-off and treatment line was performed. Twenty trials (1,475 patients) were identified. A significant interaction (p<0.0001) according to tumor PD-L1 expression was found in the overall sample with an ORR of 34.1% (95% CI 27.6-41.3%) in the PD-L1 positive and 19.9% (95% CI 15.4-25.3%) in the PD-L1 negative population. ORR was significantly higher in PD-L1 positive in comparison to PD-L1 negative patients for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, with an absolute difference of 16.4% and 19.5%, respectively. A significant difference in activity of 22.8% and 8.7% according to PD-L1 was found for melanoma and NSCLC, respectively, with no significant difference for genitourinary cancer. Overall, the three antibodies provide a significant differential effect in terms of activity according to PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. The predictive value of PD-L1 on tumor cells seems to be more robust for anti-PD-1 antibody (nivolumab and pembrolizumab), and in the context of advanced melanoma and NSCLC.",cancer
531,"TERT mutation in glioma: Frequency, prognosis and risk.","Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) has received a great deal of attention in recent years for its role as a prognostic and predictive molecular marker of glioma. However, the results of studies examining its mutation frequency and predictive value are inconsistent, and several studies have investigated the association between TERT gene polymorphisms and gliomagenesis. We used a meta-analysis approach to examine these unsolved problems. A bibliography search using EMBASE and MEDLINE was performed to identify potentially relevant articles and conference abstracts that investigated TERT mutations in glioma. The references contained in the identified trials were also examined to identify any other relevant published or unpublished articles. Sixteen studies were included. Pooled estimates of the relative risks (RR), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), hazard ratios (HR) and frequency were calculated. TERT mutations occurred frequently in glioblastoma (69%) and oligodendrogliomas (72%) but were less frequent in astrocytomas (24%) and oligoastrocytomas (38%). The HR for glioma patients with TERT mutations versus wild type TERT was 1.63 (95% CI 1.35-1.98). TERT polymorphisms were associated with an increased risk of glioma compared to controls (RR=1.28, 95% CI 1.23-1.33). Our study shows that the TERT gene is a valuable prognostic and predictive biomarker of glioma, and TERT gene polymorphisms are significantly associated with an increased risk of glioma.",cancer
412,Nuclear DICKKOPF-1 as a biomarker of chemoresistance and poor clinical outcome in colorectal cancer.,"Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) insurgence and progression depend on the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Dickkopf (DKK)-1 is an extracellular inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling that also has undefined β-catenin-independent actions. Here we report for the first time that a proportion of DKK-1 locates within the nucleus of healthy small intestine and colon mucosa, and of CRC cells at specific chromatin sites of active transcription. Moreover, we show that DKK-1 regulates several cancer-related genes including the cancer stem cell marker aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1) and Ral-binding protein 1-associated Eps domain-containing 2 (REPS2), which are involved in detoxification of chemotherapeutic agents. Nuclear DKK-1 expression is lost along CRC progression; however, it remains high in a subset (15%) of CRC patients (n = 699) and associates with decreased progression-free survival (PFS) after chemotherapy administration and overall survival (OS) [adjusted HR, 1.65; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.23-2.21; P = 0.002)]. Overexpression of ALDH1A1 and REPS2 associates with nuclear DKK-1 expression in tumors and correlates with decreased OS (P = 0.001 and 0.014) and PFS. In summary, our findings demonstrate a novel location of DKK-1 within the cell nucleus and support a role of nuclear DKK-1 as a predictive biomarker of chemoresistance in colorectal cancer.",cancer
2413,PRDX2 protects hepatocellular carcinoma SMMC-7721 cells from oxidative stress.,"Peroxiredoxin2 (PRDX2) is a member of the peroxiredoxin family of antioxidant enzymes. A number of previous studies have indicated that PRDX2 may serve a cell type-dependent role in tumorigenesis. Recently, PRDX2 has been identified to be the new target of miR-122a, which has been demonstrated to be frequently downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Thus, PRDX2 may have a pro-tumorigenic role in HCC. Because the role of PRDX2 in HCC has not yet been reported, it is of interest to explore how PRDX2 may affect reactive oxygen species (ROS)-mediated cell death in HCC cells. The present study analyzed the effects of PRDX2 knockdown or overexpression on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced cell death in HCC SMMC-7721 cells. Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced cell death upon PRDX2 knockdown or overexpression was also examined in SMMC-7721 cells. It was found that PRDX2 knockdown augmented H2O2-induced cell death in SMMC-7721 cells, whereas PRDX2 overexpression exhibited opposite effects. By contrast, PRDX2 knockdown enhanced TNF-α-induced apoptosis, whereas PRDX2 overexpression reduced it, even though both treatments showed little effects on TNF-α-induced necrosis in SMMC-7721 cells. Further exploration confirmed PRDX2 knockdown led to enhanced ROS generation in response to H2O2. Taken together, the present study supports that PRDX2 serves a pro-tumorigenic role in HCC through, at least partially, limiting ROS-mediated apoptosis under oxidative stress.",nonCancer

The ratio of intracellular fluid (ICF) resistance (Ri) to extracellular fluid (ECF) resistance (Re) of a whole leg normalized to the right arm (Ri/Re leg), a surrogate parameter for ECF/ICF, and the Ri/Re of the thigh and calf without normalization (Ri/Re thigh, Ri/Re calf, respectively) were obtained. Increases in Ri/Re leg (N 2.5 ± 0.7, VE 3.9 ± 3.7, LE 3.7 ± 1.5), Ri/Re thigh (N 1.8 ± 0.5, VE 3.2 ± 3.8, LE 3.8 ± 1.9), and Ri/Re calf (N 2.6 ± 0.6, VE 4.6 ± 1.7, LE 4.4 ± 2.2) were confirmed in VE and LE compared to normal subjects. However, the ratios of Ri/Re calf to Ri/Re thigh in normal subjects and those with untreated VE/LE were all ∼1.5 (N 1.5 ± 0.3, VE 1.5 ± 0.7, LE 1.6 ± 0.7).|Fluid content was increased in legs with VE and LE compared to normal subjects, while the mode of gravitational fluid distribution was similar among all legs.

684,Immune Checkpoint Inhibition for Hypermutant Glioblastoma Multiforme Resulting From Germline Biallelic Mismatch Repair Deficiency.,"Recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is incurable with current therapies. Biallelic mismatch repair deficiency (bMMRD) is a highly penetrant childhood cancer syndrome often resulting in GBM characterized by a high mutational burden. Evidence suggests that high mutation and neoantigen loads are associated with response to immune checkpoint inhibition. We performed exome sequencing and neoantigen prediction on 37 bMMRD cancers and compared them with childhood and adult brain neoplasms. Neoantigen prediction bMMRD GBM was compared with responsive adult cancers from multiple tissues. Two siblings with recurrent multifocal bMMRD GBM were treated with the immune checkpoint inhibitor nivolumab. All malignant tumors (n = 32) were hypermutant. Although bMMRD brain tumors had the highest mutational load because of secondary polymerase mutations (mean, 17,740 ± standard deviation, 7,703), all other high-grade tumors were hypermutant (mean, 1,589 ± standard deviation, 1,043), similar to other cancers that responded favorably to immune checkpoint inhibitors. bMMRD GBM had a significantly higher mutational load than sporadic pediatric and adult gliomas and all other brain tumors (P < .001). bMMRD GBM harbored mean neoantigen loads seven to 16 times higher than those in immunoresponsive melanomas, lung cancers, or microsatellite-unstable GI cancers (P < .001). On the basis of these preclinical data, we treated two bMMRD siblings with recurrent multifocal GBM with the anti-programmed death-1 inhibitor nivolumab, which resulted in clinically significant responses and a profound radiologic response. This report of initial and durable responses of recurrent GBM to immune checkpoint inhibition may have implications for GBM in general and other hypermutant cancers arising from primary (genetic predisposition) or secondary MMRD.",cancer
2369,GLI2 expression levels in radical nephrectomy specimens as a predictor of disease progression in patients with metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma following treatment with sunitinib.,"The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of the Hedgehog signaling pathway in the progression of metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (m-ccRCC) as well as the molecular targets of sunitinib, an inhibitor of multiple tyrosine kinases. A total of 39 patients subjected to radical nephrectomy who were diagnosed with m-ccRCC and were subsequently treated with sunitinib were enrolled in the present study. The expression levels of the Hedgehog signaling proteins (GLI1, GLI2, cyclin D1, cyclin E and transforming growth factor-β) and major molecular targets of sunitinib [vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-1 and -2, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and -β] in primary RCC specimens were assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The expression levels of GLI2, VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and pre-treatment C-reactive protein as well as the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk were identified as significant predictors of progression-free survival (PFS). Of these, only GLI2 expression was independently correlated to PFS according to multivariate analysis. Furthermore, treatment with sunitinib resulted in a marked inhibition of GLI2 expression in the parental human RCC ACHN cell line, but not in ACHN cells with acquired resistance to sunitinib. These findings suggested that GLI2 may be involved in the acquisition of resistance to sunitinib in RCC; thus, it may be useful to consider the expression levels of GLI2 in addition to conventional prognostic parameters when selecting m-ccRCC patients likely to benefit from treatment with sunitinib.",nonCancer
1662,Abnormal functional connectivity density in patients with ischemic white matter lesions: An observational study.,"White matter lesions (WMLs) are frequently detected in elderly people. Previous structural and functional studies have demonstrated that WMLs are associated with cognitive and motor decline. However, the underlying mechanism of how WMLs lead to cognitive decline and motor disturbance remains unclear. We used functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM) to investigate changes in brain functional connectivity in 16 patients with ischemic WMLs and 13 controls. Both short- and long-range FCD maps were computed, and group comparisons were performed between the 2 groups. A correlation analysis was further performed between regions with altered FCD and cognitive test scores (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] and Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA]) in the patient group. We found that patients with ischemic WMLs showed reduced short-range FCD in the temporal cortex, primary motor cortex, and subcortical region, which may account for inadequate top-down attention, impaired motor, memory, and executive function associated with WMLs. The positive correlation between primary motor cortex and MoCA scores may provide evidence for the influences of cognitive function on behavioral performance. The inferior parietal cortex exhibited increased short-range FCD, reflecting a hyper bottom-up attention to compensate for the inadequate top-down attention for language comprehension and information retrieval in patients with WMLs. Moreover, the prefrontal and primary motor cortex showed increased long-range FCD and the former positively correlated with MoCA scores, which may suggest a strategy of cortical functional reorganization to compensate for motor and executive deficits. Our findings provide new insights into how WMLs cause cognitive and motor decline from cortical functional connectivity perspective.",nonCancer

JAK2V617F mutations were identified in 9 (7.8%) of 116 CMML/a CML samples, and in 2 (4.2%) of 48 MDS samples. We did not identify the JAK2V617F disease allele in B-lineage ALL (n = 83), T-cell ALL (n = 93), or CLL (n = 45).

319,Cisplatin and fluorouracil with or without panitumumab in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SPECTRUM): an open-label phase 3 randomised trial.,"Previous trials have shown that anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies can improve clinical outcomes of patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). We assessed the efficacy and safety of panitumumab combined with cisplatin and fluorouracil as first-line treatment for these patients. This open-label phase 3 randomised trial was done at 126 sites in 26 countries. Eligible patients were aged at least 18 years; had histologically or cytologically confirmed SCCHN; had distant metastatic or locoregionally recurrent disease, or both, that was deemed to be incurable by surgery or radiotherapy; had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 1 or less; and had adequate haematological, renal, hepatic, and cardiac function. Patients were randomly assigned according to a computer-generated randomisation sequence (1:1; stratified by previous treatment, primary tumour site, and performance status) to one of two groups. Patients in both groups received up to six 3-week cycles of intravenous cisplatin (100 mg/m(2) on day 1 of each cycle) and fluorouracil (1000 mg/m(2) on days 1-4 of each cycle); those in the experimental group also received intravenous panitumumab (9 mg/kg on day 1 of each cycle). Patients in the experimental group could choose to continue maintenance panitumumab every 3 weeks. The primary endpoint was overall survival and was analysed by intention to treat. In a prospectively defined retrospective analysis, we assessed tumour human papillomavirus (HPV) status as a potential predictive biomarker of outcomes with a validated p16-INK4A (henceforth, p16) immunohistochemical assay. Patients and investigators were aware of group assignment; study statisticians were masked until primary analysis; and the central laboratory assessing p16 status was masked to identification of patients and treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00460265. Between May 15, 2007, and March 10, 2009, we randomly assigned 657 patients: 327 to the panitumumab group and 330 to the control group. Median overall survival was 11·1 months (95% CI 9·8-12·2) in the panitumumab group and 9·0 months (8·1-11·2) in the control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0·873, 95% CI 0·729-1·046; p=0·1403). Median progression-free survival was 5·8 months (95% CI 5·6-6·6) in the panitumumab group and 4·6 months (4·1-5·4) in the control group (HR 0·780, 95% CI 0·659-0·922; p=0·0036). Several grade 3 or 4 adverse events were more frequent in the panitumumab group than in the control group: skin or eye toxicity (62 [19%] of 325 included in safety analyses vs six [2%] of 325), diarrhoea (15 [5%] vs four [1%]), hypomagnesaemia (40 [12%] vs 12 [4%]), hypokalaemia (33 [10%] vs 23 [7%]), and dehydration (16 [5%] vs seven [2%]). Treatment-related deaths occurred in 14 patients (4%) in the panitumumab group and eight (2%) in the control group. Five (2%) of the fatal adverse events in the panitumumab group were attributed to the experimental agent. We had appropriate samples to assess p16 status for 443 (67%) patients, of whom 99 (22%) were p16 positive. Median overall survival in patients with p16-negative tumours was longer in the panitumumab group than in the control group (11·7 months [95% CI 9·7-13·7] vs 8·6 months [6·9-11·1]; HR 0·73 [95% CI 0·58-0·93]; p=0·0115), but this difference was not shown for p16-positive patients (11·0 months [7·3-12·9] vs 12·6 months [7·7-17·4]; 1·00 [0·62-1·61]; p=0·998). In the control group, p16-positive patients had numerically, but not statistically, longer overall survival than did p16-negative patients (HR 0·70 [95% CI 0·47-1·04]). Although the addition of panitumumab to chemotherapy did not improve overall survival in an unselected population of patients with recurrent or metastatic SCCHN, it improved progression-free survival and had an acceptable toxicity profile. p16 status could be a prognostic and predictive marker in patients treated with panitumumab and chemotherapy. Prospective assessment will be necessary to validate our biomarker findings. Amgen Inc.",cancer

Two independent radiologists and one nuclear medicine specialist reviewed all WB-MRI and FDG-PET/CT scans prospectively performed on 104 patients with newly diagnosed lymphoma (53 males; 47 Hodgkin; mean age: 44 years; range, 15-86 years) between 2013 and 2015. The delay between imaging scans and BMBs was up to 10 days. The diagnostic accuracy of WB-MRI (1.5 Tesla MR scanner, with T1w, T2w-STIR, and DWI sequences) was evaluated using BMB and FDG-PET/CT as the reference standard. We applied Cohen's kappa coefficient to assess the inter-observer agreement in WB-MRI interpretation and to compare WB-MRI, FDG-PET/CT and BMB. The Student's t test was done to compare pelvic marrow ADC values of patients with positive and negative BMB. A P-value of < 0.01 was considered significant.|Inter-observer agreement was excellent (k = 0.937). Agreement between WB-MRI and FDG-PET/CT was excellent, with a k = 0.935. Agreement between WB-MRI and BMB was moderate (k = 0.489), and fair between FDG-PET/CT and BMB (k = 0.370). WB-MRI and FDG-PET/CT were falsely negative in four indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas with BMI < 30% of marrow cellularity. Conversely, WB-MRI and FDG-PET/CT detected all cases with a BMI>30% of marrow cellularity.

1145,Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is sufficient for cell cycle entry and promotes cellular changes characteristic of oncogenic transformation.,"Using a new inducible form of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) we have found that PI 3-kinase activation has the following effects on cell growth and proliferation. (i) Activation of PI 3-kinase was sufficient to promote entry into S phase of the cell cycle within several hours. This was shown by activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (Cdk4) and Cdk2 and by the induction of DNA synthesis. (ii) PI 3-kinase activation alone was not, however, sufficient to provide for progression through the entire cell cycle. Instead, prolonged activation of PI 3-kinase in the absence of serum stimulation resulted in apoptosis. It is possible that the cells undergo apoptosis because the PI 3-kinase-induced entry into the cell cycle is abnormal. For example, we found that the cyclin E-Cdk2 complex, which normally disappears after entry into S phase of the cell cycle, fails to be downregulated following induction by PI 3-kinase. (iii) Finally, we found that prolonged activation of PI 3-kinase in the presence of serum resulted in cellular changes that resemble those associated with oncogenic transformation. The cells reached high densities, were irregular and refractile in appearance, and formed colonies in soft agar. In contrast, neither PI 3-kinase nor serum stimulation alone could induce these changes. Our results suggest that activation of PI 3-kinase promotes anchorage-independent cell growth and entry into the cell cycle but does not abrogate the growth factor requirement for cell proliferation.",cancer
1767,A Medial Portal for Hip Arthroscopy in Children With Septic Arthritis: A Safety Study.,"Prompt open arthrotomy is historically utilized to treat pediatric septic arthritis of the hip, but arthroscopy has been described as a valid alternative to prevent long-term sequelae. Standard hip arthroscopy in adolescents and adults utilizes lateral-based portals, but successful irrigation in infants may necessitate a medial portal due to the smaller joint size. The purpose of this study was to determine the safety of a medial hip portal in children based on its anatomic relation to neurovascular structures.|A retrospective review of children 6 years of age or below with septic hip arthritis who obtained a preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) between 2009 and 2015 was performed. Multiple measures were recorded from the MRI to create a 3D cone with the vertex just posterior to the adductor longus at the convergence of the gluteal and inguinal creases-a previously described posteromedial portal-with the cone base being a circle defined as the central joint diameter. The distance to the femoral vessels and nerve were then recorded. An adult cadaver was then utilized to replicate the proposed portal starting point and trajectory to confirm that it could be reproducible in a clinical setting.|After applying criteria, 47 MRI were evaluated (21 boys, 26 girls) demonstrating a mean distance to femoral vessels and nerve: at insertion, 18.9 mm (minimum 10.5 mm) and at the hip joint, 11.1 mm (minimum 5.2 mm). Girls and boys did not differ significantly, but there was a significant correlation of both age (r=0.75) and body weight (r=0.84) to the measured distance (P<0.001). Imaging of the cadaver confirmed that the starting point could be replicated.|There is a direct relation to size of the child and the distance from the neurovascular structures to the cannula trajectory, but even the smallest of children have at least 5.5 mm of adductor longus to protect the femoral structures. A medial-based portal that utilizes a medial needle for initial aspiration features a wide margin of safety for children requiring treatment for septic hip arthritis.|Level IV.",nonCancer
890,"Prognostic value of different cut-off levels of Ki-67 in breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 64,196 patients.","A proliferative marker, expressed as the percentage of cells in a cell cycle, has been developed and used as a discriminant of more aggressive malignant phenotypes in early breast cancer (BC). The marker is usually expressed by the immunohistochemical staining of the cell cycle antigen Ki-67. It has not, however, yet been definitely evaluated, due to methodological concerns, which specific Ki-67 cut-off provide the strongest prognostic information in resected BC. We conducted a meta-analysis to explore the prognostic value of different cut-off levels of Ki-67 in terms of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in early BC. The databases of PubMed, the ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, SCOPUS, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and CINHAL were used to identify the relevant literature. Data from studies reporting a hazard ratio (HR) and a 95 % confidence interval (CI) calculated as a multivariate analysis were pooled in a meta-analysis, with metaregression used to test for trends in predefined subgroups. All the statistical tests were 2-sided. Forty-one studies encompassing 64,196 BC patients were included in the analysis. Overall, n = 25 studies were available for the OS analysis. The pooled HR for high versus low Ki-67 was 1.57 (95 % CI 1.33-1.87, P < 0.00001). Twenty-nine studies were available for the DFS analysis. The pooled HR for high versus low Ki-67 was 1.50 (95 % CI 1.34-1.69, P < 0.00001). When a cut-off of Ki-67 staining ≥ 25 % was used, the pooled HR for OS was 2.05 (95 % CI 1.66-2.53, P < 0.00001), which was significantly different to studies where the cut-offs chosen were <25 %. In ER+ tumors, the HR for high versus low Ki-67 was similar and significant (HR = 1.51, 95 % CI 1.25-1.81, P < 0.0001). We conclude that Ki-67 has an independent prognostic value in terms of OS in BC patients. The Ki-67 threshold with the greatest prognostic significance is as yet unknown, but a cut-off >25 % is associated with a greater risk of death compared with lower expression rates.",cancer
478,The unfolded protein response regulator GRP78 is a novel predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer.,"Adjuvant fluoropyrimidine-based (5-FU) chemotherapy is a mainstay of treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC), but only provides benefit for a subset of patients. To improve stratification we examined (for the first time in CRC), whether analysis of GRP78 expression provides a predictive biomarker and performed functional studies to examine the role of GRP78 in sensitivity to 5-FU. 396 CRC patient samples were collected in a prospective uniform manner and GRP78 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays using a well-validated antibody. Expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters and survival. The role of GRP78 in 5-FU sensitivity was examined in CRC cells using siRNA, drug inhibition and flow cytometry. GRP78 expression was significantly elevated in cancer tissue (p < 0.0001), and correlated with depth of invasion (p = 0.029) and stage (p = 0.032). Increased overall 5-year survival was associated with high GRP78 expression (p = 0.036). Patients with stage II cancers treated by surgery alone, with high GRP78 also had improved survival (71% v 50%; p = 0.032). Stage III patients with high GRP78 showed significant benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy (52% vs. 28%; p = 0.026), whereas patients with low GRP78 failed to benefit (28% vs. 32%; p = 0.805). Low GRP78 was an independent prognostic indicator of reduced overall 5-year survival (p = 0.004; HR = 1.551; 95%CI 1.155-2.082). In vitro, inhibition of GRP78 reduces apoptosis in response to 5-FU in p53 wild-type cells. GRP78 expression may provide a simple additional risk stratification to inform the adjuvant treatment of CRC and future studies should combine analysis with determination of p53 status.",cancer

Herein, we report that an amphiphilic chlorambucil-based prodrug consisting of a fluorescence reporter and a D-mannose targeting ligand could directly self-assemble into glutathione-responsive nanovesicles for selective cancer therapy and intracellular imaging. These nanovesicles could be dissociated to release the chlorambucil drug with obviously red-shifted fluorescence when internalized by D-mannose receptor-overexpressed MCF-7 cancer cells.

High protein content in cow´s milk and increased protein consumption by children during the complementary feeding period is associated to the risk of developing a high body mass index and obesity in school-age children; therefore, milk consumption should be mildly restricted during the second year of life and to 480-720 ml/day during the first years of life. Its relationship with some diseases has not been confirmed, and milk consumption is associated with iron deficiency. The use of low-fat cow's milk instead of regular milk in young children remains controversial and its introduction is not advised before 2 to 4 years of age.",nonCancer
1960,Analysis of injury patterns and roles of care in US and Israel militaries during recent conflicts: Two are better than one.,"As new conflicts emerge and enemies evolve, military medical organizations worldwide must adopt the 'lessons learned'. In this study we describe roles of care (ROC) deployed and injuries sustained by both US and Israeli militaries during recent conflicts. The purpose of this collaborative work is facilitate exchange of medical data among allied forces in order to advance military medicine and facilitate strategic readiness for future military engagements that may involve less predictable situations of evacuation and care, such as prolonged field care.|This retrospective study was conducted for the periods of 2003 to 2014 from data retrieved from the Department of Defense Trauma Registry and the Israel Defense Force (IDF) Trauma Registry. Comparative analyses included ROC capabilities, casualties who died of wounds (DOW), as well as mechanism of injury, anatomical wound distribution and, and injury severity score (ISS) of US and IDF casualties during recent conflicts.|Although concept of ROC was similar among militaries, the IDF supports increased capabilities at POI and Role 1 including the presence of physicians, but with limited deployment of other ROC; conversely, the US maintains fewer capabilities at Role 1, but utilized the entire spectrum of care, including extensive deployment of Roles 2/2+, during recent conflicts. Casualties from US Forces (n=19,005) and IDF (n=2,637) exhibited significant differences in patterns of injury with higher proportions of casualties who DOW in the US Forces (4%) compared to the IDF (0.6%).|As these data suggest deployed ROC and injury patterns of US and Israeli militaries were both conflict- and system-specific. We envision that identification of discordant factors and common medical strategies of the two militaries will enable strategic readiness for future conflicts as well as foster further collaboration among allied forces with the overarching universal goal of eliminating preventable death on the battlefield.",nonCancer
1263,Inhibition of BRD4 Suppresses Cell Proliferation and Induces Apoptosis in Renal Cell Carcinoma.,"Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains an intractable genitourinary malignancy. Resistance to chemotherapy or targeted therapies in RCC is presumably due to the complicated underlying molecular mechanisms and insufficient understanding. The aim of this research was to assess the expression and role of bromodomain-4 protein (BRD4) in RCC and evaluate the effects of BRD4 inhibitor JQ1 for RCC treatment. BRD4 expressionlevels were assessed by qRT-PCR and western blot in RCC tissues and cells. The effects of BRD4 knockdown or JQ1 on RCC cells were assessed by MTT assay and flow cytometry. The effects of in vivo treatment were evaluated through xenograft experiments. BRD4 is significantly overexpressed in RCC, and is related to tumor stage and lymph node metastasis. Inhibition of BRD4 suppressed RCC cell proliferation, induced cell apoptosis in vitro and repressed tumor growth in vivo. Inhibition of BRD4 decreased BCL2 and C-MYC expression while increased BAX and cleaved caspase3 expression, and strikingly diminished the recruitment of BRD4 to BCL2 promoter. Our research reveals that BRD4 probably play a critical role in RCC progression, and is a new promising target for pharmacological treatment directed against this intractable disease.",cancer
1698,Identification of Chromosome Segment Substitution Lines of Gossypium barbadense Introgressed in G. hirsutum and Quantitative Trait Locus Mapping for Fiber Quality and Yield Traits.,"Chromosome segment substitution lines MBI9804, MBI9855, MBI9752, and MBI9134, which were obtained by advanced backcrossing and continuously inbreeding from an interspecific cross between CCRI36, a cultivar of upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) as the recurrent parent, and Hai1, a cultivar of sea island cotton (G. barbadense) as the donor parent, were used to construct a multiple parent population of (MBI9804×MBI9855)×(MBI9752×MBI9134). The segregating generations of double-crossed F1 and F2 and F2:3 were used to map the quantitative trait locus (QTL) for fiber quality and yield-related traits. The recovery rate of the recurrent parent CCRI36 in the four parental lines was from 94.3%-96.9%. Each of the parental lines harbored 12-20 introgressed segments from Hai1across 21 chromosomes. The number of introgressed segments ranged from 1 to 27 for the individuals in the three generations, mostly from 9 to 18, which represented a genetic length of between 126 cM and 246 cM. A total of 24 QTLs controlling fiber quality and 11 QTLs controlling yield traits were detected using the three segregating generations. These QTLs were distributed across 11 chromosomes and could collectively explain 1.78%-20.27% of the observed phenotypic variations. Sixteen QTLs were consistently detected in two or more generations, four of them were for fiber yield traits and 12 were for fiber quality traits. One introgressed segment could significantly reduce both lint percentage and fiber micronaire. This study provides useful information for gene cloning and marker-assisted breeding for excellent fiber quality.",nonCancer

In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that statins reduce airway smooth muscle cells proliferation and inflammatory mediators' release. Statins reduce chemokine release and mucus production from airway epithelial cells besides attenuating subepithelial fibrosis and eosinophils recruitment. In acute and chronic allergen driven animal models of asthma, statins reduce airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation and remodeling. However, the effectiveness of statins in clinical trials results in contradictory conclusions based on study design and treatment protocol. Therefore, more clinical trials are needed to evaluate their role in asthma patients.",nonCancer
861,Whole-genome sequencing reveals complex mechanisms of intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition.,"BRAF is mutated in ∼42% of human melanomas (COSMIC. http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) and pharmacological BRAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib achieve dramatic responses in patients whose tumours harbour BRAF(V600) mutations. Objective responses occur in ∼50% of patients and disease stabilisation in a further ∼30%, but ∼20% of patients present primary or innate resistance and do not respond. Here, we investigated the underlying cause of treatment failure in a patient with BRAF mutant melanoma who presented primary resistance. We carried out whole-genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis of five metastatic tumours from the patient. We validated mechanisms of resistance in a cell line derived from the patient's tumour. We observed that the majority of the single-nucleotide variants identified were shared across all tumour sites, but also saw site-specific copy-number alterations in discrete cell populations at different sites. We found that two ubiquitous mutations mediated resistance to BRAF inhibition in these tumours. A mutation in GNAQ sustained mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling, whereas a mutation in PTEN activated the PI3 K/AKT pathway. Inhibition of both pathways synergised to block the growth of the cells. Our analyses show that the five metastases arose from a common progenitor and acquired additional alterations after disease dissemination. We demonstrate that a distinct combination of mutations mediated primary resistance to BRAF inhibition in this patient. These mutations were present in all five tumours and in a tumour sample taken before BRAF inhibitor treatment was administered. Inhibition of both pathways was required to block tumour cell growth, suggesting that combined targeting of these pathways could have been a valid therapeutic approach for this patient.",cancer
399,Whole blood defensin mRNA expression is a predictive biomarker of docetaxel response in castration-resistant prostate cancer.,"This study tested the potential of circulating RNA-based signals as predictive biomarkers for docetaxel response in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). RNA was analyzed in blood from six CRPC patients by whole-transcriptome sequencing (total RNA-sequencing) before and after docetaxel treatment using the Illumina's HiSeq platform. Targeted RNA capture and sequencing was performed in an independent cohort of ten patients with CRPC matching the discovery cohort to confirm differential expression of the genes. Response to docetaxel was defined on the basis of prostate-specific antigen levels and imaging criteria. Two-way analysis of variance was used to compare differential gene expression in patients classified as responders versus nonresponders before and after docetaxel treatment. Thirty-four genes with two-fold differentially expressed transcripts in responders versus nonresponders were selected from total RNA-sequencing for further validation. Targeted RNA capture and sequencing showed that 13/34 genes were differentially expressed in responders. Alpha defensin genes DEFA1, DEFA1B, and DEFA3 exhibited significantly higher expression in responder patients compared with nonresponder patients before administration of chemotherapy (fold change >2.5). In addition, post-docetaxel treatment significantly increased transcript levels of these defensin genes in responders (fold change >2.8). Our results reveal that patients with higher defensin RNA transcripts in blood respond well to docetaxel therapy. We suggest that monitoring DEFA1, DEFA1B, and DEFA3 RNA transcripts in blood prior to treatment will be helpful to determine which patients are better candidates to receive docetaxel chemotherapy.",cancer

A role for ncRNAs in muscle pathologies has been demonstrated and further evidence suggests that ncRNAs also play a role in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Studies investigating the differential expression of miRNAs in biological fluids between DMD patients and models of dystrophin deficiency (the MDX mouse model, canine models of DMD) and controls have been published, as these have a role in fibrosis. Long noncoding RNAs are differentially expressed in DMD patients and may, in part, have a mechanism of action via targeting of miRNAs. Although many of these recent findings need to be confirmed, ncRNAs may prove to be useful as potential biomarkers of disease. However, their use as therapeutic targets in DMD remains unclear.",nonCancer

Our objective was to define a genetic-based algorithm to select patients to be treated with irinotecan/5FU. Genotyping of TYMS (5'TRP and 3'UTR), UGT1A1(*)28, UGT1A9(*)22 and UGT1A7(*)3 was performed in 149 metastatic CRC patients treated with irinotecan/5FU as first-line chemotherapy enrolled in a randomised phase 3 study. Their association with response, toxicity and survival was investigated by univariate and multivariate statistical analysis. TYMS 3TRP/3TRP genotype was the only independent predictor of tumour response (OR=5.87, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.68-20.45; P=0.005). UGT1A1(*)28/(*)28 was predictive for haematologic toxicity (OR=6.27, 95% CI=1.09-36.12; P=0.04), specifically for neutropenia alone (OR=6.40, 95% CI=1.11-37.03; P=0.038) or together with diarrhoea (OR=18.87, 95% CI=2.14-166.67; P=0.008). UGT1A9(*)1/(*)1 was associated with non-haematologic toxicity (OR=2.70, 95% CI=1.07-6.82; P=0.035). Haplotype VII (all non-favourable alleles) was associated with non-haematologic toxicity (OR=2.11, 95% CI=1.12-3.98; P=0.02). TYMS and UGT1A polymorphisms influence on tumour response and toxicities derived from irinotecan/5FU treatment in CRC patients.

142,p53-mediated senescence impairs the apoptotic response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in breast cancer.,"Studies on the role of TP53 mutation in breast cancer response to chemotherapy are conflicting. Here, we show that, contrary to dogma, MMTV-Wnt1 mammary tumors with mutant p53 exhibited a superior clinical response compared to tumors with wild-type p53. Doxorubicin-treated p53 mutant tumors failed to arrest proliferation, leading to abnormal mitoses and cell death, whereas p53 wild-type tumors arrested, avoiding mitotic catastrophe. Senescent tumor cells persisted, secreting senescence-associated cytokines exhibiting autocrine/paracrine activity and mitogenic potential. Wild-type p53 still mediated arrest and inhibited drug response even in the context of heterozygous p53 point mutations or absence of p21. Thus, we show that wild-type p53 activity hinders chemotherapy response and demonstrate the need to reassess the paradigm for p53 in cancer therapy.",cancer
2437,Gliomatosis peritonei with bilateral ovarian teratomas: A report of two cases.,"Gliomatosis peritonei (GP) is characterized by the presence of benign, mature neuroglial implants throughout the peritoneum and is typically accompanied by mature or immature ovarian teratomas. GP is a condition that has only been described relatively recently, with ~100 cases reported in the English literature. The majority of reported cases have focused on the pathology and clinical treatment of the disease; radiological findings are distinct, but the discussion of this is scarce in the literature. The current study presents two cases of GP with bilateral ovarian teratomas and provides a review of the relevant literature, with particular emphasis on the radiological differential diagnosis. The present study reinforces previously reported observations from imaging analysis and suggests that radiological investigation alone cannot sufficiently aid the differentiation of benign glial deposits from diffuse peritoneal malignant seeding. However, radiologists should be familiar with this rare condition in order to provide an accurate diagnosis, particularly in ovarian tumor staging, which may markedly impact the administered treatment. It is recommended that doctors undertake long-term follow-ups in patients presenting with GP due to the potential for malignant transformation.",nonCancer
787,Characterization of the novel and specific PI3Kα inhibitor NVP-BYL719 and development of the patient stratification strategy for clinical trials.,"Somatic PIK3CA mutations are frequently found in solid tumors, raising the hypothesis that selective inhibition of PI3Kα may have robust efficacy in PIK3CA-mutant cancers while sparing patients the side-effects associated with broader inhibition of the class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family. Here, we report the biologic properties of the 2-aminothiazole derivative NVP-BYL719, a selective inhibitor of PI3Kα and its most common oncogenic mutant forms. The compound selectivity combined with excellent drug-like properties translates to dose- and time-dependent inhibition of PI3Kα signaling in vivo, resulting in robust therapeutic efficacy and tolerability in PIK3CA-dependent tumors. Novel targeted therapeutics such as NVP-BYL719, designed to modulate aberrant functions elicited by cancer-specific genetic alterations upon which the disease depends, require well-defined patient stratification strategies in order to maximize their therapeutic impact and benefit for the patients. Here, we also describe the application of the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia as a preclinical platform to refine the patient stratification strategy for NVP-BYL719 and found that PIK3CA mutation was the foremost positive predictor of sensitivity while revealing additional positive and negative associations such as PIK3CA amplification and PTEN mutation, respectively. These patient selection determinants are being assayed in the ongoing NVP-BYL719 clinical trials.",cancer

1173,"EGF receptor gene mutations are common in lung cancers from ""never smokers"" and are associated with sensitivity of tumors to gefitinib and erlotinib.","Somatic mutations in the tyrosine kinase (TK) domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are reportedly associated with sensitivity of lung cancers to gefitinib (Iressa), kinase inhibitor. In-frame deletions occur in exon 19, whereas point mutations occur frequently in codon 858 (exon 21). We found from sequencing the EGFR TK domain that 7 of 10 gefitinib-sensitive tumors had similar types of alterations; no mutations were found in eight gefitinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.004). Five of seven tumors sensitive to erlotinib (Tarceva), a related kinase inhibitor for which the clinically relevant target is undocumented, had analogous somatic mutations, as opposed to none of 10 erlotinib-refractory tumors (P = 0.003). Because most mutation-positive tumors were adenocarcinomas from patients who smoked <100 cigarettes in a lifetime (""never smokers""), we screened EGFR exons 2-28 in 15 adenocarcinomas resected from untreated never smokers. Seven tumors had TK domain mutations, in contrast to 4 of 81 non-small cell lung cancers resected from untreated former or current smokers (P = 0.0001). Immunoblotting of lysates from cells transiently transfected with various EGFR constructs demonstrated that, compared to wild-type protein, an exon 19 deletion mutant induced diminished levels of phosphotyrosine, whereas the phosphorylation at tyrosine 1092 of an exon 21 point mutant was inhibited at 10-fold lower concentrations of drug. Collectively, these data show that adenocarcinomas from never smokers comprise a distinct subset of lung cancers, frequently containing mutations within the TK domain of EGFR that are associated with gefitinib and erlotinib sensitivity.",cancer
908,FBXW7 mutations in patients with advanced cancers: clinical and molecular characteristics and outcomes with mTOR inhibitors.,"FBXW7 is a tumor suppressor gene responsible for the degradation of several proto-oncogenes. Preclinical data suggest that FBXW7 mutations sensitize cells to mTOR inhibitors. Clinicopathologic characteristics of cancer patients with FBXW7 mutations and their responses to mTOR inhibitors remain unknown. Using multiplex gene panels we evaluated how the FBXW7 mutation affected the cancer phenotype of patients referred to a phase I clinic starting January 2012. Whenever possible patients positive for FBXW7 mutation were treated with regimens containing an mTOR inhibitors and their outcomes were reviewed. FBXW7 mutations were detected in 17 of 418 patients (4.0%). Among tumor types with more than 10 patients tested, FBXW7 mutations occurred in colorectal cancer (7/49; 14.3%), squamous cell cancer of head and neck (2/18; 11.1%), liver (1/13; 7.7%), and ovarian cancers (1/40; 2.5%). No one clinical, pathological or demographic feature was characteristic of the FBXW7-mutated patient population. The mutation occurred in isolation in only 2/17 (12%) patients, and KRAS was frequently found as a concomitant mutation, especially in patients with colorectal cancer (6/7; 86%). Ten patients were treated on a protocol containing an mTOR inhibitor, with a median time to treatment failure of 2.8 months (range, 1.3-6.8). One patient with liver cancer (fibrolamellar subtype) continues to have a prolonged stable disease for 6.8+ months. In patients with advanced cancers, somatic mutations in FBXW7 usually occur with other simultaneous molecular aberrations, which can contribute to limited therapeutic efficacy of mTOR inhibitors.",cancer
1936,Characterization of DOM Adsorption of CNTs by Using Excitation-Emission Matrix Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Multiway Analysis.,"Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were utilized to adsorb DOM in micro-polluted water. The characteristics of DOM adsorption on CNTs were investigated based on UV254, TOC, and fluorescence spectrum measurements. Based on PARAFAC (parallel factor) analysis, four fluorescent components were extracted, including one protein-like component (C4) and three humic acid-like components (C1, C2, and C3). The adsorption isotherms, kinetics, and thermodynamics of DOM adsorption on CNTs were further investigated. A Freundlich isotherm model fit the adsorption data well with high values of correlation. As a type of macro-porous and meso-porous adsorbent. CNTs preferably adsorb humic acid-like substance rather than protein-like substances. The increasing temperature will speed up the adsorption process. The self-organizing map (SOM) analysis further explains the fluorescent properties of water samples. The results provide a new insight into the adsorption behaviour of DOM fluorescent components on CNTs.",nonCancer
632,Trastuzumab beyond progression in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer: a german breast group 26/breast international group 03-05 study.,"Trastuzumab shows clinical activity in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2)-positive early and advanced breast cancer. In the German Breast Group 26/Breast International Group 03-05 trial, we investigated if trastuzumab treatment should be continued beyond progression. Patients with HER-2-positive breast cancer that progresses during treatment with trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive capecitabine (2,500 mg/m(2) body-surface area on days 1 through 14 [1,250 mg/m(2) semi-daily]) alone or with continuation of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg body weight) in 3-week cycles. The primary end point was time to progression. We randomly assigned 78 patients to capecitabine and 78 patients to capecitabine plus trastuzumab. Sixty-five events and 38 deaths in the capecitabine group and 62 events and 33 deaths in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group occurred during 15.6 months of follow-up. Median times to progression were 5.6 months in the capecitabine group and 8.2 months in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group with an unadjusted hazard ratio of 0.69 (95% CI, 0.48 to 0.97; two-sided log-rank P = .0338). Overall survival rates were 20.4 months (95% CI, 17.8 to 24.7) in the capecitabine group and 25.5 months (95% CI, 19.0 to 30.7) in the capecitabine-plus-trastuzumab group (P = .257). Overall response rates were 27.0% with capecitabine and 48.1% with capecitabine plus trastuzumab (odds ratio, 2.50; P = .0115). Continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression was not associated with increased toxicity. Continuation of trastuzumab plus capecitabine showed a significant improvement in overall response and time to progression compared with capecitabine alone in women with HER-2-positive breast cancer who experienced progression during trastuzumab treatment.",cancer
2350,Infertility in men with inflammatory bowel disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) predominantly affects young adults. Fertility-related issues are therefore important in the management of patients with IBD. However, relatively modest attention has been paid to reproductive issues faced by men with IBD. To investigate the effects of IBD and its treatment on male fertility, we reviewed the current literature using a systematic search for published studies. A PubMed search were performed using the main search terms ""IBD AND male infertility"", ""Crohn's disease AND male infertility"", ""ulcerative colitis AND male infertility"". References in review articles were used if relevant. We noted that active inflammation, poor nutrition, alcohol use, smoking, medications, and surgery may cause infertility in men with IBD. In surgery such as proctocolectomy with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis, rectal incision seems to be associated with sexual dysfunction. Of the medications used for IBD, sulfasalazine reversibly reduces male fertility. No other medications appear to affect male fertility significantly, although small studies suggested some adverse effects. There are limited data on the effects of drugs for IBD on male fertility and pregnancy outcomes; however, patients should be informed of the possible effects of paternal drug exposure. This review provides information on fertility-related issues in men with IBD and discusses treatment options.",nonCancer
2321,Stereotactically-navigated percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation (IRE) compared to conventional IRE: a prospective trial.,"Purpose. The purpose of this study was to compare CT-navigated stereotactic IRE (SIRE) needle placement to non-navigated conventional IRE (CIRE) for percutaneous ablation of liver malignancies. Materials and Methods. A prospective trial including a total of 20 patients was conducted with 10 patients in each arm of the study. IRE procedures were guided using either CT fluoroscopy (CIRE) or a stereotactic planning and navigation system (SIRE). Primary endpoint was procedure time. Secondary endpoints were accuracy of needle placement, technical success rate, complication rate and dose-length product (DLP). Results. A total of 20 IRE procedures were performed to ablate hepatic malignancies (16 HCC, 4 liver metastases), 10 procedures in each arm. Mean time for placement of IRE electrodes in SIRE was significantly shorter with 27 ± 8 min compared to 87 ± 30 min for CIRE (p < 0.001). Accuracy of needle placement for SIRE was higher than CIRE (2.2 mm vs. 3.3 mm mean deviation, p < 0.001). The total DLP and the fluoroscopy DLP were significantly lower in SIRE compared to CIRE. Technical success rate and complication rates were equal in both arms. Conclusion. SIRE demonstrated a significant reduction of procedure length and higher accuracy compared to CIRE. Stereotactic navigation has the potential to reduce radiation dose for the patient and the radiologist without increasing the risk of complications or impaired technical success compared to CIRE.",nonCancer
862,Therapeutic CDK4/6 inhibition in breast cancer: key mechanisms of response and failure.,"A hallmark of cancer is the deregulation of cell-cycle machinery, ultimately facilitating aberrant proliferation that fuels tumorigenesis and disease progression. Particularly, in breast cancers, cyclin D1 has a crucial role in the development of disease. Recently, a highly specific inhibitor of CDK4/6 activity (PD-0332991) has been developed that may have efficacy in the treatment of breast cancer. To interrogate the utility of PD-0332991 in treating breast cancers, therapeutic response was evaluated on a panel of breast cancer cell lines. These analyses showed that the chronic loss of Rb is specifically associated with evolution to a CDK4/6-independent state and, ultimately, resistance to PD-0332991. However, to interrogate the functional consequence of Rb directly, knockdown experiments were performed in models that represent immortalized mammary epithelia and multiple subtypes of breast cancer. These studies showed a highly specific role for Rb in mediating the response to CDK4/6 inhibition that was dependent on transcriptional repression manifest through E2F, and the ability to attenuate CDK2 activity. Acquired resistance to PD-03322991 was specifically associated with attenuation of CDK2 inhibitors, indicating that redundancy in CDK functions represents a determinant of therapeutic failure. Despite these caveats, in specific models, PD-0332991 was a particularly effective therapy, which induced Rb-dependent cytostasis. Combined, these findings indicate the critical importance of fully understanding cell-cycle regulatory pathways in directing the utilization of CDK inhibitors in the clinic.",cancer
318,Prognostic significance of human papillomavirus in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer: an analysis of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group trials.,"The purpose of this article was to study the association of human papillomavirus (HPV) with clinical outcomes in patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Archival baseline tumor specimens were obtained from patients treated on two clinical trials in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN: E1395, a phase III trial of cisplatin and paclitaxel versus cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, and E3301, a phase II trial of irinotecan and docetaxel. HPV DNA was detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) with a wide-spectrum probe. p16 status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Clinical outcomes of interest were objective response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We analyzed 64 patients for HPV ISH and 65 for p16. Eleven tumors (17%) were HPV+, 12 (18%) were p16+, whereas 52 (80%) were both HPV- and p16-. The objective response rate was 55% for HPV-positive versus 19% for HPV-negative (P = 0.022), and 50% for p16-positive versus 19% for p16-negative (P = 0.057). The median survival was 12.9 versus 6.7 months for HPV-positive versus HPV-negative patients (P = 0.014), and 11.9 versus 6.7 months for p16-positive versus p16-negative patients (P = 0.027). After adjusting for other covariates, hazard ratio for OS was 2.69 (P = 0.048) and 2.17 (P = 0.10), favoring HPV-positive and p16-positive patients, respectively. The other unfavorable risk factor for OS was loss of ≥5% weight in previous 6 months (P = 0.0021 and 0.023 for HPV and p16 models, respectively). HPV is a favorable prognostic factor in recurrent or metastatic SCCHN that should be considered in the design of clinical trials in this setting. NCT01487733 Clinicaltrials.gov.",cancer
913,Loss of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 function contributes to poor prognosis of activated B-cell-like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.,"PRDM1/BLIMP-1, a master regulator of plasma-cell differentiation, is frequently inactivated in activated B-cell-like (ABC) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients. Little is known about its genetic aberrations and relevant clinical implications. A large series of patients with de novo DLBCL was effectively evaluated for PRDM1/BLIMP-1 deletion, mutation, and protein expression. BLIMP-1 expression was frequently associated with the ABC phenotype and plasmablastic morphologic subtype of DLBCL, yet 63% of the ABC-DLBCL patients were negative for BLIMP-1 protein expression. In these patients, loss of BLIMP-1 was associated with Myc overexpression and decreased expression of p53 pathway molecules. In addition, homozygous PRDM1 deletions and PRDM1 mutations within exons 1 and 2, which encode for domains crucial for transcriptional repression, were found to show a poor prognostic impact in patients with ABC-DLBCL but not in those with germinal center B-cell-like DLBCL (GCB-DLBCL). Gene expression profiling revealed that loss of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 expression correlated with a decreased plasma-cell differentiation signature and upregulation of genes involved in B-cell receptor signaling and tumor-cell proliferation. In conclusion, these results provide novel clinical and biological insight into the tumor-suppressive role of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 in ABC-DLBCL patients and suggest that loss of PRDM1/BLIMP-1 function contributes to the overall poor prognosis of ABC-DLBCL patients.",cancer
1196,LKB1 regulated pathways in lung cancer invasion and metastasis.,"Metastasis is characterized by the ability of cancer cells to invade into adjacent tissue, intravasate into blood or lymphatic vessels, and extravasate into a distant tissue. Metastatic disease is primarily responsible for the low 5-year survival rate of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and therefore, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate NSCLC metastasis is clearly warranted. The serine/threonine kinase and tumor suppressor LKB1 is mutated in 30% of NSCLC tumors, and recent evidence points to a prominent role in NSCLC metastasis. This review summarizes LKB1-dependent invasion pathways where compromised LKB1 function could promote NSCLC metastasis.",cancer

1531,Effects of commonly used chronic medications on the outcomes of ipilimumab therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.,"Ipilimumab can induce long-term survival in 20% of patients with metastatic melanoma. Concurrent chronic medications may impact the patient's immune system, possess antimelanoma properties, and potentially affect clinical outcomes. This retrospective study sought to describe the efficacy and toxicity effects of 12 classes of chronic medications in metastatic melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab. A total of 159 adults who received ipilimumab for metastatic melanoma at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, USA) from 1 March 2011 through 31 December 2014 were included. Classes of chronic medications included statins, metformin, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, H1 and H2 receptor antagonists, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), antidepressants, and vitamin D supplements. Of the 12 medication classes, only PPIs were found to have an increased odds of experiencing a partial response or a complete response to ipilimumab [odds ratio: 3.73; confidence interval (CI): 1.26-11.04; P=0.02] on the basis of a case-control analysis. Although not significant, PPI use also trended toward improved overall survival and progression-free survival (hazard ratio: 0.44; CI: 0.17-1.15; P=0.09; and hazard ratio: 0.6; CI: 0.34-1.06; P=0.08, respectively) on the basis of Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard modeling. No medication class was associated with an increased risk of grades 3-5 immune-related adverse events with ipilimumab on the basis of case-control analysis. In summary, patients on PPIs may be more likely to experience a partial response/complete response following ipilimumab therapy. Because of the small sample size and the retrospective nature of this work, these findings are only descriptive and further study should be carried out. Other classes of chronic medications did not produce statistically significant effects for any of the measured outcomes.",nonCancer
83,Inactivation of the DNA-repair gene MGMT and the clinical response of gliomas to alkylating agents.,"The DNA-repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) inhibits the killing of tumor cells by alkylating agents. MGMT activity is controlled by a promoter; methylation of the promoter silences the gene in cancer, and the cells no longer produce MGMT. We examined gliomas to determine whether methylation of the MGMT promoter is related to the responsiveness of the tumor to alkylating agents. We analyzed the MGMT promoter in tumor DNA by a methylation-specific polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The gliomas were obtained from patients who had been treated with carmustine (1,3-bis(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, or BCNU). The molecular data were correlated with the clinical outcome. The MGMT promoter was methylated in gliomas from 19 of 47 patients (40 percent). This finding was associated with regression of the tumor and prolonged overall and disease-free survival. It was an independent and stronger prognostic factor than age, stage, tumor grade, or performance status. Methylation of the MGMT promoter in gliomas is a useful predictor of the responsiveness of the tumors to alkylating agents.",cancer
76,Genome sequencing identifies a basis for everolimus sensitivity.,"Cancer drugs often induce dramatic responses in a small minority of patients. We used whole-genome sequencing to investigate the genetic basis of a durable remission of metastatic bladder cancer in a patient treated with everolimus, a drug that inhibits the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signaling pathway. Among the somatic mutations was a loss-of-function mutation in TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis complex 1), a regulator of mTOR pathway activation. Targeted sequencing revealed TSC1 mutations in about 8% of 109 additional bladder cancers examined, and TSC1 mutation correlated with everolimus sensitivity. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using whole-genome sequencing in the clinical setting to identify previously occult biomarkers of drug sensitivity that can aid in the identification of patients most likely to respond to targeted anticancer drugs.",cancer
1916,Skin Barrier Health: Regulation and Repair of the Stratum Corneum and the Role of Over-the-Counter Skin Care.,"The epidermis functions as a physical barrier that separates the inner body from the outside environment. The outermost layer of the epidermis, the stratum corneum, plays a key role in maintaining this barrier. There are numerous biochemical changes that take place to and in the keratinocyte as it migrates from the bottom, or startum basale, to the top layer of the epidermis in order for this barrier to function appropriately. In addition, external and internal factors, such as irritants and underlying medical diseases, can also affect the stratum corneum, both of which can potentially lead to disruption of barrier function and ultimately skin pathology. In this article, we will review keratinocyte biology as it relates to the formation and function of the stratum corneum. We will also review stratum corneum structure, physiology, and the impact of chemical agents and defective stratum corneum components that can lead to skin disease. Finally, we will briefly discuss how moisturizers repair defects in the stratum corneum and restore barrier function. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1047-1051.",nonCancer

The impact of simulated gastrointestinal (GI) digestion; the interaction with intracellular sources of oxidative stress, the intestinal cell permeability of BSY peptides and the antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities of BSY permeates were assayed. Gastrointestinal digestion of BSY autolysates enhanced antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities as measured in vitro. No cytotoxic effects were observed on Caco-2 cells after exposition to the digested BSY autolysates within a concentration range of 0.5 to 3.0 mg peptides/mL. A protective role to induced oxidative stress was observed. The transepithelial transport assays indicate high apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) values for BSY peptides across Caco-2/HT29-MTX cell monolayer (14.5-26.1x10-6 cm/s) and for Caco-2 cell monolayer model (12.4-20.8x10-6 cm/s), while the antioxidant and ACE-inhibitory activities found in fluxes material from the basolateral side suggest transepithelial absorption of bioactive compounds.",nonCancer
812,RICTOR Amplification Defines a Novel Subset of Patients with Lung Cancer Who May Benefit from Treatment with mTORC1/2 Inhibitors.,"We identified amplification of RICTOR, a key component of the mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2), as the sole actionable genomic alteration in an 18-year-old never-smoker with lung adenocarcinoma. Amplification of RICTOR occurs in 13% of lung cancers (1,016 cases) in The Cancer Genome Atlas and at a similar frequency in an independent cohort of 1,070 patients identified by genomic profiling. In the latter series, 11% of cases harbored RICTOR amplification as the only relevant genomic alteration. Its oncogenic roles were suggested by decreased lung cancer cell growth both in vitro and in vivo with RICTOR ablation, and the transforming capacity of RICTOR in a Ba/F3-cell system. The mTORC1/2 inhibitors were significantly more active against RICTOR-amplified lung cancer cells as compared with other agents targeting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Moreover, an association between RICTOR amplification and sensitivities to mTORC1/2 inhibitors was observed. The index patient has been treated with mTORC1/2 inhibitors that led to tumor stabilization for more than 18 months. RICTOR amplification may define a novel and unique molecular subset of patients with lung cancer who may benefit from treatment with mTORC1/2 inhibitors.",cancer

To date, two variants of HIP1-ALK (H21; A20) and (H28; A20) have been identified in NSCLC. However, the response of patients with NSCLC harboring HIP1-ALK to ALK inhibitors and potential resistance mechanisms to such remain unknown.

This patient and another patient with EML4-ALK variant 3a/b initially responded sequentially to crizotinib and then alectinib, a next-generation ALK inhibitor, but developed acquired resistance to alectinib with the presence of a mutation in amino acid residue 1171 (I1171N and I1171S respectively) located in the hydrophobic regulatory spine (R-spine) of the ALK kinase in both the cases as identified by a comprehensive next-generation sequencing-based assay performed on biopsies of new liver metastases that developed during alectinib treatment.",cancer
2407,DNA methylation: conducting the orchestra from exposure to phenotype?,"DNA methylation, through 5-methyl- and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5mC and 5hmC), is considered to be one of the principal interfaces between the genome and our environment, and it helps explain phenotypic variations in human populations. Initial reports of large differences in methylation level in genomic regulatory regions, coupled with clear gene expression data in both imprinted genes and malignant diseases, provided easily dissected molecular mechanisms for switching genes on or off. However, a more subtle process is becoming evident, where small (<10 %) changes to intermediate methylation levels are associated with complex disease phenotypes. This has resulted in two clear methylation paradigms. The latter ""subtle change"" paradigm is rapidly becoming the epigenetic hallmark of complex disease phenotypes, although we are currently hampered by a lack of data addressing the true biological significance and meaning of these small differences. Our initial expectation of rapidly identifying mechanisms linking environmental exposure to a disease phenotype led to numerous observational/association studies being performed. Although this expectation remains unmet, there is now a growing body of literature on specific genes, suggesting wide ranging transcriptional and translational consequences of such subtle methylation changes. Data from the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) has shown that a complex interplay between DNA methylation, extensive 5'UTR splicing, and microvariability gives rise to the overall level and relative distribution of total and N-terminal protein isoforms generated. Additionally, the presence of multiple AUG translation initiation codons throughout the complete, processed mRNA enables translation variability, hereby enhancing the translational isoforms and the resulting protein isoform diversity, providing a clear link between small changes in DNA methylation and significant changes in protein isoforms and cellular locations. Methylation changes in the NR3C1 CpG island alters the NR3C1 transcription and eventually protein isoforms in the tissues, resulting in subtle but visible physiological variability. This review addresses the current pathophysiological and clinical associations of such characteristically small DNA methylation changes, the ever-growing roles of DNA methylation and the evidence available, particularly from the glucocorticoid receptor of the cascade of events initiated by such subtle methylation changes, as well as addressing the underlying question as to what represents a genuine biologically significant difference in methylation.",nonCancer
1326,Genomic Characterization of the Novel Aeromonas hydrophila Phage Ahp1 Suggests the Derivation of a New Subgroup from phiKMV-Like Family.,"Aeromonas hydrophila is an opportunistic pathogenic bacterium causing diseases in human and fish. The emergence of multidrug-resistant A. hydrophila isolates has been increasing in recent years. In this study, we have isolated a novel virulent podophage of A. hydrophila, designated as Ahp1, from waste water. Ahp1 has a rapid adsorption (96% adsorbed in 2 min), a latent period of 15 min, and a burst size of 112 PFU per infected cell. At least eighteen Ahp1 virion proteins were visualized in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, with a 36-kDa protein being the predicted major capsid protein. Genome analysis of Ahp1 revealed a linear doubled-stranded DNA genome of 42,167 bp with a G + C content of 58.8%. The genome encodes 46 putative open reading frames, 5 putative phage promoters, and 3 transcriptional terminators. Based on high degrees of similarity in overall genome organization and among most of the corresponding ORFs, as well as phylogenetic relatedness among their DNAP, RNAP and major capsid proteins, we propose a new subgroup, designated Ahp1-like subgroup. This subgroup contains Ahp1 and members previously belonging to phiKMV-like subgroup, phiAS7, phi80-18, GAP227, phiR8-01, and ISAO8. Since Ahp1 has a narrow host range, for effective phage therapy, different phages are needed for preparation of cocktails that are capable of killing the heterogeneous A. hydrophila strains.",nonCancer
1195,Novel and natural knockout lung cancer cell lines for the LKB1/STK11 tumor suppressor gene.,"Germline mutations of the LKB1 gene are responsible for Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), an autosomal dominant inherited disorder bestowing an increased risk of cancer. We have recently demonstrated that LKB1 inactivating mutations are not confined to PJS, but also appear in lung adenocarcinomas of sporadic origin, including primary tumors and lung cancer cell lines. To accurately determine the frequency of inactivating LKB1 gene mutations in lung tumors we have sequenced the complete coding region of LKB1 in 21 additional lung cancer cell lines. Here we describe the mutational status of LKB1 gene in 30 lung cancer cell lines from different histopathological types, including 11 lung adenocarcinomas (LADs) and 11 small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). LKB1 gene alterations were present in six (54%) of the LAD cell lines tested but in none of the other histological types. Similar to our previous observations in primary tumors, all point mutations were of the nonsense or frameshift type, leading to an abnormal, truncated protein. Moreover, 2 cell lines (A427 and H2126) harbored large gene deletions that spanned several exons. Hence, we have identified additional lung cancer cell lines carrying inactivating mutations of the LKB1 tumor suppressor gene, further attesting to the significance of this gene in the development of LADs and providing new natural LKB1 knockouts for studies of the biological function of the LKB1 protein.",cancer
1742,Putative functions of tissue kallikrein-related peptidases in vaginal fluid.,"Cervical-vaginal fluid (CVF) is a complex biological fluid that hydrates the mucosa of the lower female reproductive system. In-depth proteomic and biochemical studies on CVF have revealed that it contains large amounts of endogenous proteases and protease inhibitors, including an abundance of several members of the tissue kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family. Despite their ubiquitous presence in human tissues and fluids, KLK expression levels vary considerably, with maximum expression observed in reproduction-related tissues and fluids. The roles of KLKs in the lower female reproductive system are not fully understood. The activation of KLKs in CVF is dependent on pH and various modes of KLK regulation in the vagina exist. KLKs have been postulated to have roles in physiological functions related to antimicrobial processes, vaginal and cervical epithelial desquamation, sperm transport, and the processing of fetal membranes as observed in preterm premature rupture of membranes. Increased understanding of the functional roles of KLKs in the lower female reproductive system could lead to new diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for conditions such as vaginal infections and vaginal atrophy.",nonCancer

Previous studies found that Polyphyllin G induced apoptotic cell death in human hepatoblastoma cancer and lung cancer cells. However, the underlying mechanisms of autophagy in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) remain unclear. In this study, Polyphyllin G can potently induced apoptosis dependent on the activations of caspase-8, -3, and -9 and the changes of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Bax protein expression in different human NPC cell lines (HONE-1 and NPC-039). The amount of both LC3-II and Beclin-1 was intriguingly increased suggest that autophagy was induced in Polyphyllin G-treated NPC cells. To further clarify whether Polyphyllin G-induced apoptosis and autophagy depended on AKT/ERK/JNK/p38 MAPK signaling pathways, cells were combined treated with AKT inhibitor (LY294002), ERK1/2 inhibitor (U0126), p38 MAPK inhibitor (SB203580), or JNK inhibitor (SP600125). These results demonstrated that Polyphyllin G induced apoptosis in NPC cells through activation of ERK, while AKT, p38 MAPK and JNK were responsible for Polyphyllin G-induced autophagy. Finally, an administration of Polyphyllin G effectively suppressed the tumor growth in the NPC carcinoma xenograft model in vivo. In conclusion, our results reveal that Polyphyllin G inhibits cell viability and induces apoptosis and autophagy in NPC cancer cells, suggesting that Polyphyllin G is an attractive candidate for tumor therapies. Polyphyllin G may promise candidate for development of antitumor drugs targeting nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",nonCancer

The primary end point was the response rate, defined either as an objective response according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1, or as a reduction of at least 50% in the prostate-specific antigen level or a confirmed reduction in the circulating tumor-cell count from 5 or more cells per 7.5 ml of blood to less than 5 cells per 7.5 ml. Targeted next-generation sequencing, exome and transcriptome analysis, and digital polymerase-chain-reaction testing were performed on samples from mandated tumor biopsies. Overall, 50 patients were enrolled; all had received prior treatment with docetaxel, 49 (98%) had received abiraterone or enzalutamide, and 29 (58%) had received cabazitaxel. Sixteen of 49 patients who could be evaluated had a response (33%; 95% confidence interval, 20 to 48), with 12 patients receiving the study treatment for more than 6 months. Next-generation sequencing identified homozygous deletions, deleterious mutations, or both in DNA-repair genes--including BRCA1/2, ATM, Fanconi's anemia genes, and CHEK2--in 16 of 49 patients who could be evaluated (33%). Of these 16 patients, 14 (88%) had a response to olaparib, including all 7 patients with BRCA2 loss (4 with biallelic somatic loss, and 3 with germline mutations) and 4 of 5 with ATM aberrations. The specificity of the biomarker suite was 94%. Anemia (in 10 of the 50 patients [20%]) and fatigue (in 6 [12%]) were the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events, findings that are consistent with previous studies of olaparib. Treatment with the PARP inhibitor olaparib in patients whose prostate cancers were no longer responding to standard treatments and who had defects in DNA-repair genes led to a high response rate.

656,Allelic dilution obscures detection of a biologically significant resistance mutation in EGFR-amplified lung cancer.,"EGFR is frequently mutated and amplified in lung adenocarcinomas sensitive to EGFR inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. A secondary mutation, T790M, has been associated with acquired resistance but has not been shown to be sufficient to render EGFR mutant/amplified lung cancers resistant to EGFR inhibitors. We created a model for studying acquired resistance to gefitinib by prolonged exposure of a gefitinib-sensitive lung carcinoma cell line (H3255; EGFR mutated and amplified) to gefitinib in vitro. The resulting resistant cell line acquired a T790M mutation in a small fraction of the amplified alleles that was undetected by direct sequencing and identified only by a highly sensitive HPLC-based technique. In gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cells with EGFR mutations and amplifications, exogenous introduction of EGFR T790M effectively conferred resistance to gefitinib and continued ErbB-3/PI3K/Akt signaling when in cis to an activating mutation. Moreover, continued activation of PI3K signaling by the PIK3CA oncogenic mutant, p110alpha E545K, was sufficient to abrogate gefitinib-induced apoptosis. These findings suggest that allelic dilution of biologically significant resistance mutations may go undetected by direct sequencing in cancers with amplified oncogenes and that restoration of PI3K activation via either a T790M mutation or other mechanisms can provide resistance to gefitinib.",cancer
2474,Growth inhibition and apoptotic effects of total flavonoids from Trollius chinensis on human breast cancer MCF-7 cells.,"Dried flowers of Trollius chinensis have long been used as an important traditional Chinese medicine. Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of T. chinensis flavonoids to reduce the proliferation of human breast cancer MCF-7 cells. The present study further investigated the influence of T. chinensis flavonoids on the growth and proliferation of MCF-7 cells and observed clear inhibitory effects within the concentration range of 0.0991-1.5856 mg/ml. Apoptosis was triggered by T. chinensis flavonoids treatment that was evaluated by differential interference contrast software, the Hoechst 33258 method, scanning electron microscopy, hematoxylin/eosin staining and laser confocal light microscopy. Cells treated with T. chinensis flavonoids selectively reduced bcl-2 and NF-κB expression and increased the expression of caspase-9 and caspase-3 indicating that the inhibition of cellular proliferation occurred through activation of a mitochondrial pathway. Taken together, the results confirmed the ability of T. chinensis flavonoids to inhibit cell proliferation.",nonCancer
2227,Comparison between Computed Tomography and Ultrasonography in Detecting Foreign Bodies Regarding Their Composition and Depth: An In Vitro Study.,"Impaction of foreign bodies in the soft tissues is a sequela of traumatic and penetrating injuries. Such foreign bodies should be removed due to the complications they cause. Patient's history, clinical evaluation and imaging examinations aid in the proper detection and localization of the foreign bodies.|The aim of the present study was to compare the sensitivity of computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography for detecting foreign bodies in in-vitro models simulating facial soft tissues.|Fifty foreign particles with five different compositions including wood, glass, metal, plastic, and stone were embedded in five calf tongues at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 cm depths. CT and ultrasonography were compared regarding their capability of detecting and localizing the foreign bodies.|Wood and plastic foreign bodies were demonstrated more clearly on ultrasonography images. High density materials such as metal, stone, and glass were detected with almost the same accuracy on CT and ultrasonography examinations. Visibility of the foreign bodies deteriorated on ultrasonography images as their depth increased; however, CT appearances of the foreign particles were not influenced by their depths.|Ultrasonography is an appropriate technique for detection of foreign bodies especially the ones with low density. Therefore, it seems logical to perform ultrasonography in combination with CT in cases with the suspicion of foreign body impaction.",nonCancer

Activities of daily living (ADLs) were assessed at baseline and throughout follow-up. Years of life (YoL) was defined as years until death. Years of able life (YAL) was defined as years without any ADL difficulty. YAL/YoL%, the proportion of life lived able, was used to indicate the relative compression or expansion of the disabled period.|The average duration of disabled years was 4.5 (out of 15.4 mean YoL) for women and 2.9 (out of 12.4 mean YoL) for men. In a multivariable model, obesity was associated with 7.3 percentage points (95% confidence interval (CI) = 5.4-9.2) lower YAL/YoL% than normal weight. Scores in the lowest quintile of the Alternate Healthy Eating Index were associated with a 3.7% (95% CI = 1.6-5.9) lower YAL/YoL% than scores in the highest quintile. Every 25 blocks walked in a week was associated with 0.5 percentage points (95% CI = 0.3-0.8) higher YAL/YoL%.|The effects of healthy lifestyle factors on the proportion of future life lived free of disability indicate that the disabled period can be compressed, given the right combination of these factors.",nonCancer
606,Racial differences in the overexpression of epidermal growth factor type II receptor (HER2/neu): a major prognostic indicator in uterine serous papillary cancer.,"A difference in survival rates between black and white patients with cancer of the corpus uteri is well established. This study was conducted to determine whether the overexpression of HER2/neu oncogene is associated with poor outcome in uterine serous papillary endometrial cancer, which is a highly aggressive variant of endometrial cancer, and whether a racial difference in the frequency of HER2/neu overexpression may contribute to the disparity in endometrial cancer survival. Immunohistochemical evaluation was used to examine HER2/neu expression in paraffin blocks from 27 women with stage IA to IV uterine serous papillary endometrial cancer. Univariable analysis was performed and followed by multivariable analysis with Cox's proportional hazard model to evaluate whether HER2/neu expression was associated with poor outcome in uterine serous papillary endometrial cancer. Black patients tended to be younger (P = .02) and have higher HER2/neu expression than white patients (trend P = .02). Seven of 10 black patients (70%) showed heavy (3+) expression, compared with 4 of 17 white patients (24%; P = .04). The association of heavy HER2/neu expression with race persisted after age was controlled through stratification (P = .05). Earlier deaths from uterine serous papillary endometrial cancer were seen among heavy HER2/neu expressers (P = .002), black patients (P = .04), and patients < or = 65 years old (P = .04). However, multivariate Cox regression showed that short survival was associated significantly with heavy HER2/neu expression (P = .02) but not with age (P = .07) or race (P = .35), which indicates that HER2/neu expression accounted for much of the race disparity in survival in this patient population. Overexpression of HER2/neu in uterine serous papillary endometrial cancer is an independent variable that is associated with poor outcome, occurs more frequently in black women, and may contribute to racial disparity in survival. HER2/neu expression may guide clinical treatment of patients with uterine serous papillary endometrial cancer and may have implications for the implementation of novel treatment strategies.",cancer
674,Crizotinib versus chemotherapy in advanced ALK-positive lung cancer.,"In single-group studies, chromosomal rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene (ALK) have been associated with marked clinical responses to crizotinib, an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting ALK. Whether crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy with respect to efficacy is unknown. We conducted a phase 3, open-label trial comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy in 347 patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive lung cancer who had received one prior platinum-based regimen. Patients were randomly assigned to receive oral treatment with crizotinib (250 mg) twice daily or intravenous chemotherapy with either pemetrexed (500 mg per square meter of body-surface area) or docetaxel (75 mg per square meter) every 3 weeks. Patients in the chemotherapy group who had disease progression were permitted to cross over to crizotinib as part of a separate study. The primary end point was progression-free survival. The median progression-free survival was 7.7 months in the crizotinib group and 3.0 months in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for progression or death with crizotinib, 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.37 to 0.64; P<0.001). The response rates were 65% (95% CI, 58 to 72) with crizotinib, as compared with 20% (95% CI, 14 to 26) with chemotherapy (P<0.001). An interim analysis of overall survival showed no significant improvement with crizotinib as compared with chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death in the crizotinib group, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.68 to 1.54; P=0.54). Common adverse events associated with crizotinib were visual disorder, gastrointestinal side effects, and elevated liver aminotransferase levels, whereas common adverse events with chemotherapy were fatigue, alopecia, and dyspnea. Patients reported greater reductions in symptoms of lung cancer and greater improvement in global quality of life with crizotinib than with chemotherapy. Crizotinib is superior to standard chemotherapy in patients with previously treated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer with ALK rearrangement.

2151,m(6)A RNA methylation promotes XIST-mediated transcriptional repression.,"The long non-coding RNA X-inactive specific transcript (XIST) mediates the transcriptional silencing of genes on the X chromosome. Here we show that, in human cells, XIST is highly methylated with at least 78 N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) residues-a reversible base modification of unknown function in long non-coding RNAs. We show that m(6)A formation in XIST, as well as in cellular mRNAs, is mediated by RNA-binding motif protein 15 (RBM15) and its paralogue RBM15B, which bind the m(6)A-methylation complex and recruit it to specific sites in RNA. This results in the methylation of adenosine nucleotides in adjacent m(6)A consensus motifs. Furthermore, we show that knockdown of RBM15 and RBM15B, or knockdown of methyltransferase like 3 (METTL3), an m(6)A methyltransferase, impairs XIST-mediated gene silencing. A systematic comparison of m(6)A-binding proteins shows that YTH domain containing 1 (YTHDC1) preferentially recognizes m(6)A residues on XIST and is required for XIST function. Additionally, artificial tethering of YTHDC1 to XIST rescues XIST-mediated silencing upon loss of m(6)A. These data reveal a pathway of m(6)A formation and recognition required for XIST-mediated transcriptional repression.",nonCancer
258,Heterozygous germ line hCHK2 mutations in Li-Fraumeni syndrome.,"The hCHK2 gene encodes the human homolog of the yeast Cds1 and Rad53 G2 checkpoint kinases, whose activation in response to DNA damage prevents cellular entry into mitosis. Here, it is shown that heterozygous germ line mutations in hCHK2 occur in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a highly penetrant familial cancer phenotype usually associated with inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. These observations suggest that hCHK2 is a tumor suppressor gene conferring predisposition to sarcoma, breast cancer, and brain tumors, and they also provide a link between the central role of p53 inactivation in human cancer and the well-defined G2 checkpoint in yeast.",cancer
1159,Melanomas acquire resistance to B-RAF(V600E) inhibition by RTK or N-RAS upregulation.,"Activating B-RAF(V600E) (also known as BRAF) kinase mutations occur in ∼7% of human malignancies and ∼60% of melanomas. Early clinical experience with a novel class I RAF-selective inhibitor, PLX4032, demonstrated an unprecedented 80% anti-tumour response rate among patients with B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanomas, but acquired drug resistance frequently develops after initial responses. Hypotheses for mechanisms of acquired resistance to B-RAF inhibition include secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E), MAPK reactivation, and activation of alternative survival pathways. Here we show that acquired resistance to PLX4032 develops by mutually exclusive PDGFRβ (also known as PDGFRB) upregulation or N-RAS (also known as NRAS) mutations but not through secondary mutations in B-RAF(V600E). We used PLX4032-resistant sub-lines artificially derived from B-RAF(V600E)-positive melanoma cell lines and validated key findings in PLX4032-resistant tumours and tumour-matched, short-term cultures from clinical trial patients. Induction of PDGFRβ RNA, protein and tyrosine phosphorylation emerged as a dominant feature of acquired PLX4032 resistance in a subset of melanoma sub-lines, patient-derived biopsies and short-term cultures. PDGFRβ-upregulated tumour cells have low activated RAS levels and, when treated with PLX4032, do not reactivate the MAPK pathway significantly. In another subset, high levels of activated N-RAS resulting from mutations lead to significant MAPK pathway reactivation upon PLX4032 treatment. Knockdown of PDGFRβ or N-RAS reduced growth of the respective PLX4032-resistant subsets. Overexpression of PDGFRβ or N-RAS(Q61K) conferred PLX4032 resistance to PLX4032-sensitive parental cell lines. Importantly, MAPK reactivation predicts MEK inhibitor sensitivity. Thus, melanomas escape B-RAF(V600E) targeting not through secondary B-RAF(V600E) mutations but via receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-mediated activation of alternative survival pathway(s) or activated RAS-mediated reactivation of the MAPK pathway, suggesting additional therapeutic strategies.",cancer
1315,Inhomogeneity Based Characterization of Distribution Patterns on the Plasma Membrane.,"Cell surface protein and lipid molecules are organized in various patterns: randomly, along gradients, or clustered when segregated into discrete micro- and nano-domains. Their distribution is tightly coupled to events such as polarization, endocytosis, and intracellular signaling, but challenging to quantify using traditional techniques. Here we present a novel approach to quantify the distribution of plasma membrane proteins and lipids. This approach describes spatial patterns in degrees of inhomogeneity and incorporates an intensity-based correction to analyze images with a wide range of resolutions; we have termed it Quantitative Analysis of the Spatial distributions in Images using Mosaic segmentation and Dual parameter Optimization in Histograms (QuASIMoDOH). We tested its applicability using simulated microscopy images and images acquired by widefield microscopy, total internal reflection microscopy, structured illumination microscopy, and photoactivated localization microscopy. We validated QuASIMoDOH, successfully quantifying the distribution of protein and lipid molecules detected with several labeling techniques, in different cell model systems. We also used this method to characterize the reorganization of cell surface lipids in response to disrupted endosomal trafficking and to detect dynamic changes in the global and local organization of epidermal growth factor receptors across the cell surface. Our findings demonstrate that QuASIMoDOH can be used to assess protein and lipid patterns, quantifying distribution changes and spatial reorganization at the cell surface.

331,Analysis of mTOR Gene Aberrations in Melanoma Patients and Evaluation of Their Sensitivity to PI3K-AKT-mTOR Pathway Inhibitors.,"mTOR is a validated target in cancer. It remains to be determined whether melanoma patients bearing mTOR mutation could be selected for treatment with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors. A total of 412 melanoma samples were included. Gene aberrations in all exons of mTOR were detected by Sanger sequencing and confirmed by using Agilent's SureSelect Target Enrichment System. HEK293T cells stably expressing mTOR mutants were constructed by using transcription activator-like effector nucleases technique. Function of mTOR mutants and in vitro sensitivity of gain-of-function mTOR mutations to PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors were analyzed. The overall incidence of somatic nonsynonymous mutations of mTOR was 10.4% (43/412). mTOR nonsynonymous mutations were relatively more frequent in acral (11.0%) and mucosal (14.3%) melanomas than in chronic sun-induced damage (CSD; 6.7%) and non-CSD (3.4%) melanomas. Of the 43 cases with mTOR mutations, 41 different mutations were detected, affecting 25 different exons. The median survival time for melanoma patients with mTOR nonsynonymous mutation was significantly shorter than that for patients without mTOR nonsynonymous mutation (P = 0.028). Transient expression of mTOR mutants in HEK293T cells strongly activated the mTOR-p70S6K pathway. In HEK293T cells with stable expression of H1968Y or P2213S mTOR mutants, LY294002 and AZD5363 showed higher potency than temsirolimus or BYL719 in inhibiting the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway and cell proliferation. mTOR nonsynonymous mutations are frequent in melanoma patients. mTOR nonsynonymous mutation may predict a worse prognosis of melanoma. Clinical trials with PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway inhibitors may be beneficial for melanoma patients with specific mTOR mutations.",cancer
1282,Tolerance of cyanobacteria to the toxicity of BDE-47 and their removal ability.,"Polybrominated diphenyl ethers are ubiquitous and toxic contaminants in aquatic environments. The effect of polybrominated diphenyl ether BDE-47 on five species of cyanobacteria, along with their removal ability was investigated. Four species, namely Synechocystis sp., Oscillatoria planctonica, Microcystis flos-aquae and Nostoc sp., were exposed to BDE-47 at concentrations ranging from 0.05 to 1.0 mg L(-1) for 14 days, while the exposure time for Pseudanabaena sp. was 30 days. The first four species were very tolerant to BDE-47 while growth and photosynthesis of Pseudanabaena were significantly inhibited by BDE-47 at concentrations over 0.1 mg L(-1). However, this species could recover from the toxicity of high concentrations of BDE-47 after 30 days of exposure, indicating the development of some ""resistance"" after pre-exposure to 1.0 mg L(-1) BDE-47. The ""resistant"" cells had a higher growth rate, photosynthesis and glutathione S-transferase activity than normal Pseudanabaena cells. The sensitivity of Pseudanabaena to BDE-47 toxicity was affected by its initial filament density, with cultures having a low filament density (2.3 × 10(6) filaments mL(-1)) being up to 14-15 times more sensitive than cultures with a high filament density (13 × 10(6) filaments mL(-1)). All cyanobacteria could remove 70-82% of BDE-47 in their media, with more than 60% of BDE-47 accumulated in cells. This is the first study showing the high tolerance of different cyanobacteria species to BDE-47 toxicity and their removal ability. The study also revealed that the sensitive Pseudanabaena could acquire a ""resistance"" to BDE-47, which was transferred to the next generation.",nonCancer

Control group (C), bone defects were irrigated with sterile saline; rifampin group (R), bone defects were irrigated with rifampin. In the autogenous graft group (Ag), the autogenous graft was contaminated with saliva, and the defects were filled with an autogenous graft. In the autogenous graft + rifampin group (Ag+R), the autogenous graft was contaminated with saliva and was decontaminated with rifampin, and the defects were filled with the autogenous graft. The animals were killed at 4weeks. Bone formation was assessed by micro-computed tomography scanning and stereological analyses.|The mean new bone volume was the greatest in the Ag/rifampin group (1.73 ± 0.17), followed by the Ag group (1.50 ± 0.05) (statistically significant difference at P < 0.05). The new bone volume was the lowest in the control group (1.05 ± 0.09); however, no difference was observed compared with the rifampin group (1.08 ± 0.07) (P > 0.05).|This study, despite its limitations, showed that rifampin with autogenous bone increased bone regeneration in rats with critical-size defects.",nonCancer

884,Impact of MET expression on outcome in BRAF(V600E/K) advanced melanoma.,"Preclinical data suggest that signalling through the HGF-MET pathway may confer resistance to BRAF inhibition in BRAF(V600E/K) melanoma. Therefore, blockade of HGF-MET signalling might be a valid therapeutic strategy, in combination with BRAF inhibition, in BRAF(V600E/K) melanoma. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical relevance of these observations by evaluating the survival impact of MET expression in patients with BRAF(V600E/K) advanced melanoma treated with vemurafenib. Formalin-fixed tissue blocks were obtained of tumours from patients enrolled in the BRIM2 (n = 59) and BRIM3 (n = 150) trials of vemurafenib in advanced BRAF(V600E/K) melanoma. Immunohistochemistry for MET (SP44 rabbit monoclonal antibody) was performed with a highly validated assay and clinically validated scoring system. Pretreatment MET expression was frequent at the ≥1 + cutoff (BRIM3, 31%; BRIM2, 49%), but relatively infrequent at the ≥2 + cutoff (BRIM3, 9%; BRIM2, 19%). Retrospective subset analyses showed that, irrespective of the cutoff used or the treatment arm, MET expression did not show prognostic significance, in terms of objective response rate, progression-free survival, or overall survival. MET is expressed in a proportion of BRAF(V600E/K) advanced melanomas. Further analyses on appropriately powered subsets are needed to determine the prognostic and predictive significance of MET in vemurafenib-treated melanoma.",cancer

Reports of VHL mutations are dispersed throughout original articles and databases that have not been recently updated. We compiled a comprehensive mutation table of 1,548 germline and somatic VHL mutations, derived from this protein of only 213 amino acids. We describe detailed phenotype and gene mutation information for 945 VHL families, including 30 previously unpublished kindreds from The Netherlands (six novel mutations). These data represent the most extensive catalog of germline VHL mutations to date. We also review VHL disease, known and theorized pathogenesis of common VHL manifestations, and genotype-phenotype correlations. Analysis of all VHL families, excluding germline mutations resulting in congenital polycythemias, describes the spectrum of mutation types: 52% missense, 13% frameshift, 11% nonsense, 6% in-frame deletions/insertions, 11% large/complete deletions, and 7% splice mutations.

625,A case of lung adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK fusion gene.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)--tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) is used for the patients with EGFR-mutant lung cancer. Recently, phase III studies in the patients with EGFR-mutant demonstrated that EGFR-TKI monotherapy improved progression-free survival compared with platinum-doublet chemotherapy. The echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)--anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene represents one of the newest molecular targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients who harbor EML4-ALK fusions have been associated with a lack of EGFR or KRAS mutations. We report a 39-year-old patient diagnosed as adenocarcinoma harboring EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK fusion gene. We treated this patient with erlotinib as the third line therapy, but no clinical benefit was obtained. We experienced a rare case with EGFR mutation and EML4-ALK.

2023,Genomic characterization of pediatric T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia reveals novel recurrent driver mutations.,"T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) is an aggressive hematologic malignancy with variable prognosis. It represents 15% of diagnosed pediatric ALL cases and has a threefold higher incidence among males. Many recurrent alterations have been identified and help define molecular subgroups of T-ALL, however the full range of events involved in driving transformation remain to be defined. Using an integrative approach combining genomic and transcriptomic data, we molecularly characterized 30 pediatric T-ALLs and identified common recurrent T-ALL targets such as FBXW7, JAK1, JAK3, PHF6, KDM6A and NOTCH1 as well as novel candidate T-ALL driver mutations including the p.R35L missense mutation in splicesome factor U2AF1 found in 3 patients and loss of function mutations in the X-linked tumor suppressor genes MED12 (frameshit mutation p.V167fs, splice site mutation g.chrX:70339329T>C, missense mutation p.R1989H) and USP9X (nonsense mutation p.Q117*). In vitro functional studies further supported the putative role of these novel T-ALL genes in driving transformation. U2AF1 p.R35L was shown to induce aberrant splicing of downstream target genes, and shRNA knockdown of MED12 and USP9X was shown to confer resistance to apoptosis following T-ALL relevant chemotherapy drug treatment in Jurkat leukemia cells. Interestingly, nearly 60% of novel candidate driver events were identified among immature T-ALL cases, highlighting the underlying genomic complexity of pediatric T-ALL, and the need for larger integrative studies to decipher the mechanisms that contribute to its various subtypes and provide opportunities to refine patient stratification and treatment.",nonCancer
2515,Successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in a boy with X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis deficiency presenting with hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: A case report.,"X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) deficiency, also known as X-linked lymphoproliferative syndrome type 2 (XLP2), is a rare inherited primary immunodeficiency resulting from the XIAP (also known as BIRC4) mutation. XIAP deficiency is mainly associated with familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) phenotypes, and genetic testing is crucial in diagnosing this syndrome. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is currently the only successful strategy for the treatment of this disease; however, a limited number of studies has been published concerning the outcomes of allogeneic HSCT in patients with XIAP deficiency. The present study reported a successful allogeneic HSCT performed to treat XIAP deficiency in a Chinese boy presenting with HLH. Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing were performed to confirm the diagnosis of XIAP deficiency, and allogeneic HSCT was performed. Genetic tests revealed a two-nucleotide deletion (c.1021_1022delAA) in the patient, which was inherited from his mother, and resulted in frameshift mutation and premature stop codon (p.N341fsX348); this is considered to be a disease-causing mutation. The XIAP deficiency patient underwent allogeneic HSCT, receiving busulfan-containing reduced intensity myeloablative conditioning regimen, with a good intermediate follow-up result obtained. Therefore, genetic testing is essential to confirm the diagnosis of XIAP deficiency and detect the carrier of mutation. The present case study may promote the investigation of allogeneic HSCT in patients with XIAP deficiency.",nonCancer
2312,Familiar face + novel face = familiar face? Representational bias in the perception of morphed faces in chimpanzees.,"Highly social animals possess a well-developed ability to distinguish the faces of familiar from novel conspecifics to induce distinct behaviors for maintaining society. However, the behaviors of animals when they encounter ambiguous faces of familiar yet novel conspecifics, e.g., strangers with faces resembling known individuals, have not been well characterised. Using a morphing technique and preferential-looking paradigm, we address this question via the chimpanzee's facial-recognition abilities. We presented eight subjects with three types of stimuli: (1) familiar faces, (2) novel faces and (3) intermediate morphed faces that were 50% familiar and 50% novel faces of conspecifics. We found that chimpanzees spent more time looking at novel faces and scanned novel faces more extensively than familiar or intermediate faces. Interestingly, chimpanzees looked at intermediate faces in a manner similar to familiar faces with regards to the fixation duration, fixation count, and saccade length for facial scanning, even though the participant was encountering the intermediate faces for the first time. We excluded the possibility that subjects merely detected and avoided traces of morphing in the intermediate faces. These findings suggest a bias for a feeling-of-familiarity that chimpanzees perceive familiarity with an intermediate face by detecting traces of a known individual, as 50% alternation is sufficient to perceive familiarity.",nonCancer

In these studies we investigated the effect of flavopiridol, at various concentrations, on the growth and gene expression of nine human melanoma cell lines with intact, absent or mutated p16. A cytostatic effect of flavopiridol on the growth of six melanoma cell lines with a mutated or non-expressed p16 (p16-) was seen at low concentrations of flavopiridol (mean 50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 12.5 nM), while the three melanoma cell lines with intact p16 (p16+) required higher concentrations (mean IC(50) = 25 nM) to produce this effect. Apoptotic cell death increased with increasing concentrations of flavopiridol in both p16- and p16+ cells. Exposure of cells to high flavopiridol concentrations (>100 nM) resulted in decreased expression of genes downstream in the normal p16 cell cycle control pathway (Rb and E2F) and the anti-apoptotic gene BCL2. No change in BCL2 expression was found after exposure to IC(50) concentrations of flavopiridol. These data indicate that flavopiridol in low, clinically achievable concentrations may have significant cytostatic effects, particularly in p16- melanoma cells, and may provide new molecular-based therapies for melanoma, particularly when combined with agents that target anti-apoptotic mechanisms.",cancer
1809,Ureaplasma diversum Genome Provides New Insights about the Interaction of the Surface Molecules of This Bacterium with the Host.,"Whole genome sequencing and analyses of Ureaplasma diversum ATCC 49782 was undertaken as a step towards understanding U. diversum biology and pathogenicity. The complete genome showed 973,501 bp in a single circular chromosome, with 28.2% of G+C content. A total of 782 coding DNA sequences (CDSs), and 6 rRNA and 32 tRNA genes were predicted and annotated. The metabolic pathways are identical to other human ureaplasmas, including the production of ATP via hydrolysis of the urea. Genes related to pathogenicity, such as urease, phospholipase, hemolysin, and a Mycoplasma Ig binding protein (MIB)-Mycoplasma Ig protease (MIP) system were identified. More interestingly, a large number of genes (n = 40) encoding surface molecules were annotated in the genome (lipoproteins, multiple-banded antigen like protein, membrane nuclease lipoprotein and variable surface antigens lipoprotein). In addition, a gene encoding glycosyltransferase was also found. This enzyme has been associated with the production of capsule in mycoplasmas and ureaplasma. We then sought to detect the presence of a capsule in this organism. A polysaccharide capsule from 11 to 17 nm of U. diversum was observed trough electron microscopy and using specific dyes. This structure contained arabinose, xylose, mannose, galactose and glucose. In order to understand the inflammatory response against these surface molecules, we evaluated the response of murine macrophages J774 against viable and non-viable U. diversum. As with viable bacteria, non-viable bacteria were capable of promoting a significant inflammatory response by activation of Toll like receptor 2 (TLR2), indicating that surface molecules are important for the activation of inflammatory response. Furthermore, a cascade of genes related to the inflammasome pathway of macrophages was also up-regulated during infection with viable organisms when compared to non-infected cells. In conclusion, U. diversum has a typical ureaplasma genome and metabolism, and its surface molecules, including the identified capsular material, represent major components of the organism immunopathogenesis.",nonCancer
996,Novel D761Y and common secondary T790M mutations in epidermal growth factor receptor-mutant lung adenocarcinomas with acquired resistance to kinase inhibitors.,"In patients whose lung adenocarcinomas harbor epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase domain mutations, acquired resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva) has been associated with a second-site EGFR mutation, which leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M). We aimed to elucidate the frequency and nature of secondary EGFR mutations in patients with acquired resistance to TKI monotherapy. Tumor cells from patients with acquired resistance were examined for secondary EGFR kinase domain mutations by molecular analyses. Eight of 16 patients (50% observed rate; 95% confidence interval, 25-75%) had tumor cells with second-site EGFR mutations. Seven mutations were T790M and one was a novel D761Y mutation found in a brain metastasis. When combined with a drug-sensitive L858R mutation, the D761Y mutation modestly reduced the sensitivity of mutant EGFR to TKIs in both surrogate kinase and cell viability assays. In an autopsy case, the T790M mutation was found in multiple visceral metastases but not in a brain lesion. The T790M mutation is common in patients with acquired resistance. The limited spectrum of TKI-resistant mutations in EGFR, which binds to erlotinib in the active conformation, contrasts with a wider range of second-site mutations seen with acquired resistance to imatinib, which binds to ABL and KIT, respectively, in closed conformations. Collectively, our data suggest that the type and nature of kinase inhibitor resistance mutations may be influenced by both anatomic site and mode of binding to the kinase target.",cancer
1933,Sustainable and Selective Separation of PVC and ABS from a WEEE Plastic Mixture using Microwave and/or Mild-heat Treatment with Froth Flotation.,"This study reports simple, selective and sustainable separation of chlorinated plastic (polyvinyl chloride, PVC) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) containing brominated flame retardants (BFRs) from mixed waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) plastics using microwave and/or mild-heat treatment. Microwave treatment after plastic coating with powdered activated carbon (PAC) selectively increased the hydrophilicity of the PVC surface, which facilitated PVC separation (100% recovery and purity) from the WEEE plastic mixture under the optimum flotation conditions. A further mild-heat treatment for 100 sec facilitated selective separation with the highest recovery and purity (100%) of PAC-coated ABS containing BFRs from the remaining plastic mixture due to selective formation of a twisted structure with a lower density than water and the untreated ABS. Mild-heat treatment only of PAC-coated WEEE plastic mixture resulted in successful recovery of (100%) the ABS and PVC. However, the recovered PVC had slightly reduced purity (96.8%) as compared to that obtained using the combined heat and microwave treatments. The combination of both treatments with flotation facilitated selective and sustainable separation of PVC and ABS from WEEE plastics to improve their recycling quality.",nonCancer
715,Anaplastic lymphoma kinase-positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: a rare clinicopathologic entity with poor prognosis.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) -positive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a rare variant of DLBCL that has been described only in small case reports. To shed more light on the clinical and pathologic features and outcome of these tumors, we reviewed data from 38 patients. We retrospectively analyzed 38 patients with ALK-positive DLBCL treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP-like regimens from different institutions to better define the presenting features, clinical course, and response to treatment. The histologic findings in all patients were similar. All patients expressed ALK fusion proteins, but virtually all were CD30 and CD20 negative. The median age was 43 years with a 5:1 ratio of males to females. Most patients (60%) followed an aggressive clinical course with advanced stage at diagnosis, frequent marrow infiltration, and poor outcome. Overall survival was 20.3 months (95% CI, 12.2 to 42.6 months). Of note, the median survival was only 12.2 months (95% CI, 9.1 to 32.5 months) in patients with advanced-stage disease. ALK-positive DLBCLs display clinicopathologic features that distinguish them from common DLBCL. Conventional therapy, as used for typical DLBCL, is of limited efficacy. Recognition of this new entity and the characteristic lack of CD20 expression are paramount. Novel front-line intensive chemotherapy regimens should be evaluated in this group of patients.",cancer
2223,Outcome of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy on Local Recurrence and Distant Metastasis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Retrospective Study.,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCH) is controversial in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC).|The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of NCH on OSCC prognosis.|In this retrospective cohort study, 94 patients were studied in two groups. The patients in group 1 received NCH before the surgery, and those in group 2 underwent resection without any chemotherapy prior to surgery. The employed NCH agents consisted of cisplatin in combination with 5-fluorouracil in two treatment courses. Tumor size, lymph node involvement, age, and follow-up time were considered as variable factors of the study. Local recurrence (LR) and distant metastasis (DM) were outcomes of the study.|Comparison of LR and DM in various tumor sizes demonstrated no significant difference between the two groups (p> 0.05). Analysis of the data did not show any statistically significant difference between the groups for LR in subjects with N0, N1 and N2. Each one-year increase in age was associated with 10% increase in the hazard ratio (HR) (HR distance metastasis Y/N = 1.10, p= 0.05). In the same analysis, when considering LR as a dependent factor, LR risk in N2 was 3 times more than in N1 (p= 0.02). LR risk in N3 was 5 times more than in N1 [HR local recurrence (p= 0.006).|Based on our results, neoadjuvant chemotherapy with combination of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil may not improve prognosis of OSCC. However, further studies are suggested to assess other neoadjuvant chemotherapy protocols in OSCC patients.",nonCancer

Three species were found, namely Terebellides cf. woolawa, Terebellides hutchingsae spec. nov. (a new species fully described and illustrated), and Terebellides sp. (likely a new species, but with only one available specimen). The new species is characterised by the combination of some branchial (number, fusion and relative length of lobes and papillation of lamellae), and thoracic (lateral lobes and relative length of notopodia) characters and is compared with all species described or reported in the SW Indo-Pacific area, as well as with those sharing similar morphological characteristics all around the world. The taxonomic relevance of the relative length of branchial lobes and different types of ciliature in branchial lamellae for species discrimination in the genus is discussed. A key to all Terebellides species described in SE Indo-Pacific waters is presented.",nonCancer
707,Brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.,"Systemic anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare, mature T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cells express the surface antigen CD30, and more than half express the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein. These 2 proteins provide unique therapeutic targets in ALCL. Remission rates in ALCL with combination chemotherapy are approximately 80%, but relapse after first-line therapy is common. Brentuximab vedotin is a US Food and Drug Administration-approved, antibody-drug conjugate that combines an anti-CD30 antibody with monomethylauristatin E, a potent antimicrotubule agent. Response rates to brentuximab vedotin in patients with relapsed/refractory ALK and ALK ALCL have exceeded 80% with frequent complete responses and a median duration of response greater than 1 year. Brentuximab vedotin in combination with chemotherapy is being explored as a first-line therapy in ALCL. Crizotinib is an inhibitor of ALK tyrosine kinase that has been approved for the treatment of ALK non-small cell lung cancer. Successful treatment of ALK ALCL with crizotinib has been reported in pediatric patients and small case series leading to ongoing trials in relapsed/refractory ALCL. Brentuximab vedotin and crizotinib represent major advances in the treatment of ALK and ALK ALCL and will likely result in marked improvement in prognosis for this subset of aggressive lymphomas.",cancer
1520,Milk Growth Factors and Expression of Small Intestinal Growth Factor Receptors during the Perinatal Period In Mice.,"BackgroundGrowth factors (GFs) are milk bioactive components contributing to the regulation of neonatal small intestinal maturation, and their receptors on the small intestinal epithelium play essential roles in mediating the functions of GFs. There is limited data correlating milk GFs and their receptors in the neonatal small intestine during the perinatal period.MethodsSmall intestines of C57BL/6N mouse pups were collected at regular intervals during fetal life and up to postnatal day (PD) 60. Gene expression of GF receptors was determined by real time qPCR. Milk GF concentrations up to PD21 were analyzed by ELISA.ResultsThe majority of GF receptors showed significantly greater expression in the fetus than in postnatal life, and a sharp decrease occurred from PD14 extending to PD60; solid food restriction (PD14 and PD18) did not affect this decrease. Concentrations of five detected milk GFs demonstrated that GFs and the corresponding small intestinal receptors exhibited different correlations, with only milk transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) having a significant positive correlation with TGF-β receptor 1 mRNA.ConclusionGene expression of small intestinal GF receptors is likely a process of neonatal intestinal maturation that is affected concurrently by milk GFs and additional endogenous factors.Pediatric Research (2016); doi:10.1038/pr.2016.150.",nonCancer
2335,In Vivo Monitoring of Microcirculation in Burn Healing Process with Optical Microangiography.,"Objective: Optical microangiography (OMAG)-based optical coherence tomography is a noninvasive technique capable of imaging functional microvasculature innervating scanned tissue volume. In this study, we utilize OMAG to investigate dynamic changes of microcirculation during the healing process of a burn. Approach: A soft-contact superficial burn injury was induced on a mouse ear with 1 μL 70°C hot water. Microangiograms were generated by using OMAG before and after the burn. Results: Vessel recruitment and remodeling were observed in the healing process. Burn injury reached to the worst extent within the first 24 h and had no expansion thereafter. The interrupted microcirculation in the mouse ear was progressively recovered in the consequent postburn days and completely healed on postburn day 7. Innovation: OMAG provides a novel way for noninvasive visualization and quantification of vasculature changes over time after burn injuries. The high resolution achieved by the imaging system reveals microvascular details down to capillary level. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that OMAG has great potential to improve the understanding of microcirculatory responses to burns and thus benefit the development of effective therapeutics.",nonCancer
1179,Analysis of epidermal growth factor receptor gene mutation in patients with non-small cell lung cancer and acquired resistance to gefitinib.,"Non-small cell lung cancers carrying activating mutations in the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are highly sensitive to EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, most patients who initially respond subsequently experience disease progression while still on treatment. Part of this ""acquired resistance"" is attributable to a secondary mutation resulting in threonine to methionine at codon 790 (T790M) of EGFR. We sequenced exons 18 to 21 of the EGFR gene to look for secondary mutations in tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib in 14 patients with adenocarcinomas. Subcloning or cycleave PCR was used in addition to normal sequencing to increase the sensitivity of the assay. We also looked for T790M in pretreatment samples from 52 patients who were treated with gefitinib. We also looked for secondary KRAS gene mutations because tumors with KRAS mutations are generally resistant to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Seven of 14 tumors had a secondary T790M mutation. There were no other novel secondary mutations. We detected no T790M mutations in pretreatment specimens from available five tumors among these seven tumors. Patients with T790M tended to be women, never smokers, and carrying deletion mutations, but the T790M was not associated with the duration of gefitinib administration. None of the tumors had an acquired mutation in the KRAS gene. A secondary T790M mutation of EGFR accounted for half the tumors with acquired resistance to gefitinib in Japanese patients. Other drug-resistant secondary mutations are uncommon in the EGFR gene.",cancer
2054,Dynamics of the Extended String-Like Interaction of TFIIE with the p62 Subunit of TFIIH.,"General transcription factor II E (TFIIE) contains an acid-rich region (residues 378-393) in its α-subunit, comprising 13 acidic and two hydrophobic (Phe387 and Val390) residues. Upon binding to the p62 subunit of TFIIH, the acidic region adopts an extended string-like structure on the basic groove of the pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of p62, and inserts Phe387 and Val390 into two shallow pockets in the groove. Here, we have examined the dynamics of this interaction by NMR and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Although alanine substitution of Phe387 and/or Val390 greatly reduced binding to PHD, the binding mode of the mutants was similar to that of the wild-type, as judged by the chemical-shift changes of the PHD. NMR relaxation dispersion profiles of the interaction exhibited large amplitudes for residues in the C-terminal half-string in the acidic region (Phe387, Glu388, Val390, Ala391, and Asp392), indicating a two-site binding mode: one corresponding to the final complex structure, and one to an off-pathway minor complex. To probe the off-pathway complex structure, an atomically detailed free-energy landscape of the binding mode was computed by all-atom multicanonical MD. The most thermodynamically stable cluster corresponded to the final complex structure. One of the next stable clusters was the off-pathway structure cluster, showing the reversed orientation of the C-terminal half-string on the PHD groove, as compared with the final structure. MD calculations elucidated that the C-terminal half-acidic-string forms encounter complexes mainly around the positive groove region with nearly two different orientations of the string, parallel and antiparallel to the final structure. Interestingly, the most encountered complexes exhibit a parallel-like orientation, suggesting that the string has a tendency to bind around the groove in the proper orientation with the aid of Phe387 and/or Val390 to proceed smoothly to the final complex structure.",nonCancer
940,Phase II study of mTORC1 inhibition by everolimus in neurofibromatosis type 2 patients with growing vestibular schwannomas.,"Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) is a genetic disorder with bilateral vestibular schwannomas (VS) as the most frequent manifestation. Merlin, the NF2 tumor suppressor, was identified as a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1. Pre-clinical data in mice showed that mTORC1 inhibition delayed growth of NF2-schwannomas. We conducted a prospective single-institution open-label phase II study to evaluate the effects of everolimus in ten NF2 patients with progressive VS. Drug activity was monitored every 3 months. Everolimus was administered orally for 12 months and, if the decrease in tumor volume was >20 % from baseline, treatment was continued for 12 additional months. Other patients stopped when completed 12 months of everolimus but were allowed to resume treatment when VS volume was >20 % during 1 year follow-up. Nine patients were evaluable. Safety was evaluated using CTCAE 3.0 criteria. After 12 months of everolimus, no reduction in volume ≥20 % was observed. Four patients had progressive disease, and five patients had stable disease with a median annual growth rate decreasing from 67 %/year before treatment to 0.5 %/year during treatment. In these patients, tumor growth resumed within 3-6 months after treatment discontinuation. Everolimus was then reintroduced and VS decreased by a median 6.8 % at 24 months. Time to tumor progression increased threefold from 4.2 months before treatment to > 12 months. Hearing was stable under treatment. The safety of everolimus was manageable. Although the primary endpoint was not reached, further studies are required to confirm the potential for stabilization of everolimus.",cancer
2516,In vivo testing of porous Ti-25Nb alloy serving as a femoral stem prosthesis in a rabbit model.,"The aim of the present study was to observe the performance of Ti-25Nb alloys with various porosities as femoral stem prostheses in a rabbit model, thus providing basic experimental evidence for the development of porous prostheses. The porous Ti-25Nb alloy prostheses were designed according to the morphology of the medullary cavity. These prostheses were placed into the femoral medullary cavities in 36 New Zealand white rabbits. Postoperative X-ray films, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the implant interface, energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the implant surface, pulling-out test and general observations were conducted. The specimens showed good biocompatibility; there was no obvious bone absorption in porous Ti-25Nb specimens with different porosities at different time points observed using X-ray films. Under SEM examination, calcium deposits were observed inside the pores and in the interface between bone and prostheses. The EDS analysis demonstrated that calcium deposits were present on the surface of the prostheses at the eight-week point postoperatively. The pulling-out test showed good bonding strength between bone and implant; after pulling out, the surface and inside the pores of the prostheses all presented bone mass. Porous Ti-25Nb alloy implants presents good biocompatibility as well as providing a biological fixation between the bone and implant. A porosity of 70% is more advantageous to the newborn bone ingrowth, combined with achieving a more solid bone-implant interface.",nonCancer

We studied the efficacy of dabrafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutated metastatic melanoma. We enrolled patients in this open-label phase 3 trial between Dec 23, 2010, and Sept 1, 2011. This report is based on a data cutoff date of Dec 19, 2011. Patients aged 18 years or older with previously untreated, stage IV or unresectable stage III BRAF(V600E) mutation-positive melanoma were randomly assigned (3:1) to receive dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily, orally) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks). Patients were stratified according to American Joint Committee on Cancer stage (unresectable III+IVM1a+IVM1b vs IVM1c). The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival and was analysed by intention to treat; safety was assessed per protocol. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01227889. Of the 733 patients screened, 250 were randomly assigned to receive either dabrafenib (187 patients) or dacarbazine (63 patients). Median progression-free survival was 5·1 months for dabrafenib and 2·7 months for dacarbazine, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0·30 (95% CI 0·18-0·51; p<0·0001). At data cutoff, 107 (57%) patients in the dabrafenib group and 14 (22%) in the dacarbazine group remained on randomised treatment. Treatment-related adverse events (grade 2 or higher) occurred in 100 (53%) of the 187 patients who received dabrafenib and in 26 (44%) of the 59 patients who received dacarbazine. The most common adverse events with dabrafenib were skin-related toxic effects, fever, fatigue, arthralgia, and headache. The most common adverse events with dacarbazine were nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, fatigue, and asthenia. Grade 3-4 adverse events were uncommon in both groups. Dabrafenib significantly improved progression-free survival compared with dacarbazine. GlaxoSmithKline.",cancer
115,ESR1 ligand-binding domain mutations in hormone-resistant breast cancer.,"Seventy percent of breast cancers express estrogen receptor (ER), and most of these are sensitive to ER inhibition. However, many such tumors for unknown reasons become refractory to inhibition of estrogen action in the metastatic setting. We conducted a comprehensive genetic analysis of two independent cohorts of metastatic ER-positive breast tumors and identified mutations in ESR1 affecting the ligand-binding domain (LBD) in 14 of 80 cases. These included highly recurrent mutations encoding p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly alterations. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the structures of the Tyr537Ser and Asp538Gly mutants involve hydrogen bonding of the mutant amino acids with Asp351, thus favoring the agonist conformation of the receptor. Consistent with this model, mutant receptors drive ER-dependent transcription and proliferation in the absence of hormone and reduce the efficacy of ER antagonists. These data implicate LBD-mutant forms of ER in mediating clinical resistance to hormonal therapy and suggest that more potent ER antagonists may be of substantial therapeutic benefit.",cancer
133,The GATA2 transcriptional network is requisite for RAS oncogene-driven non-small cell lung cancer.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide; nearly half contain mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS pathway. Here we show that RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells depend on the transcription factor GATA2. Loss of GATA2 reduced the viability of NSCLC cells with RAS-pathway mutations, whereas wild-type cells were unaffected. Integrated gene expression and genome occupancy analyses revealed GATA2 regulation of the proteasome, and IL-1-signaling, and Rho-signaling pathways. These pathways were functionally significant, as reactivation rescued viability after GATA2 depletion. In a Kras-driven NSCLC mouse model, Gata2 loss dramatically reduced tumor development. Furthermore, Gata2 deletion in established Kras mutant tumors induced striking regression. Although GATA2 itself is likely undruggable, combined suppression of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically approved inhibitors caused marked tumor clearance. Discovery of the nononcogene addiction of KRAS mutant lung cancers to GATA2 presents a network of druggable pathways for therapeutic exploitation.",cancer
2086,"An Efficient, Recyclable and Stable Immobilized Biocatalyst Based on Bioinspired Microcapsules-in-Hydrogel Scaffolds.","Design and preparation of high-performance immobilized biocatalysts with exquisite structures and elucidation of their profound structure-performance relationship are highly desired for green and sustainable biotransformation processes. Learning from nature has been recognized as a shortcut to achieve such impressive goal. Loose connective tissue, which composes of hierarchically organized cells by extracellular matrix (ECM) and is recognized as an efficient catalytic system to ensure the ordered proceeding of metabolism, may offer an ideal prototype for preparing immobilized biocatalysts with high catalytic activity, recyclability and stability. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of loose connective tissue, we prepare an immobilized biocatalyst enabled by Microcapsules-in-Hydrogel (MCH) scaffolds via biomimetic mineralization in agarose hydrogel. In brief, the in situ synthesized hybrid microcapsules encapsulated with glucose oxidase (GOD) are hierarchically organized by the fibrous framework of agarose hydrogel, where the fibers are intercalated into the capsule wall. The as-prepared immobilized biocatalyst shows structure-dependent catalytic performance. The porous hydrogel permits free diffusion of glucose molecules (diffusion coefficient: ~6×10-6 cm2 s-1, close to that in water) and retains the enzyme activity as much as possible after immobilization (initial reaction rate: 1.5×10-2 mM min-1). The monolithic macroscale of agarose hydrogel facilitates the easy recycling of the immobilized biocatalyst (only by using tweezers), which contributes to the non-activity decline during the recycling test. The fiber-intercalating structure elevates the mechanical stability of the in situ synthesized hybrid microcapsules, which inhibits the leaching and enhances the stability of the encapsulated GOD, achieving immobilization efficiency of ~95%. This study will, therefore, provide a generic method for the hierarchical organization of (bio)active materials and the rational design of novel (bio)catalysts.",nonCancer
2523,Comparison of saccharification and fermentation of steam exploded rice straw and rice husk.,"Rice cultivation produces two waste streams, straw and husk, which could be exploited more effectively. Chemical pretreatment studies using rice residues have largely focussed on straw exploitation alone, and often at low substrate concentrations. Moreover, it is currently not known how rice husk, the more recalcitrant residue, responds to steam explosion without the addition of chemicals.|The aim of this study has been to systematically compare the effects of steam explosion severity on the enzymatic saccharification and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation of rice straw and husk produced from a variety widely grown in Vietnam (Oryza sativa, cv. KhangDan18). Rice straw and husk were steam exploded (180-230 °C for 10 min) into hot water and washed to remove fermentation inhibitors. In both cases, pretreatment at 210 °C and above removed most of the noncellulosic sugars. Prolonged saccharification at high cellulase doses showed that rice straw could be saccharified most effectively after steam explosion at 210 °C for 10 min. In contrast, rice husk required more severe pretreatment conditions (220 °C for 10 min), and achieved a much lower yield (75 %), even at optimal conditions. Rice husk also required a higher cellulase dose for optimal saccharification (10 instead of 6 FPU/g DM). Hemicellulase addition failed to improve saccharification. Small pilot scale saccharification at 20 % (w/v) substrate loading in a 10 L high torque bioreactor resulted in similarly high glucose yields for straw (reaching 9 % w/v), but much less for husk. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation under optimal pretreatment and saccharification conditions showed similar trends, but the ethanol yield from the rice husk was less than 40 % of the theoretical yield.|Despite having similar carbohydrate compositions, pretreated rice husk is much less amenable to saccharification than pretreated rice straw. This is likely to attenuate its use as a biorefinery feedstock unless improvements can be made either in the feedstock through breeding and/or modern biotechnology, or in the pretreatment through the employment of improved or alternative technologies. Physiological differences in the overall chemistry or structure may provide clues to the nature of lignocellulosic recalcitrance.",nonCancer
281,Kinase mutations and imatinib response in patients with metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor.,"Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) express constitutively activated mutant isoforms of KIT or kinase platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) that are potential therapeutic targets for imatinib mesylate. The relationship between mutations in these kinases and clinical response to imatinib was examined in a group of patients with advanced GIST. GISTs from 127 patients enrolled onto a phase II clinical study of imatinib were examined for mutations of KIT or PDGFRA. Mutation types were correlated with clinical outcome. Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA were found in 112 (88.2%) and six (4.7%) GISTs, respectively. Most KIT mutations involved exon 9 (n = 23) or exon 11 (n = 85). All KIT mutant isoforms, but only a subset of PDGFRA mutant isoforms, were sensitive to imatinib, in vitro. In patients with GISTs harboring exon 11 KIT mutations, the partial response rate (PR) was 83.5%, whereas patients with tumors containing an exon 9 KIT mutation or no detectable mutation of KIT or PDGFRA had PR rates of 47.8% (P =.0006) and 0.0% (P <.0001), respectively. Patients whose tumors contained exon 11 KIT mutations had a longer event-free and overall survival than those whose tumors expressed either exon 9 KIT mutations or had no detectable kinase mutation. Activating mutations of KIT or PDGFRA are found in the vast majority of GISTs, and the mutational status of these oncoproteins is predictive of clinical response to imatinib. PDGFRA mutations can explain response and sensitivity to imatinib in some GISTs lacking KIT mutations.",cancer
1108,Identification of a structurally novel BTK mutation that drives ibrutinib resistance in CLL.,"Ibrutinib (ibr), a first-in-class Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor, has demonstrated high response rates in both relapsed/refractory and treatment naïve chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). However, about 25% of patients discontinue ibrutinib therapy at a median follow-up of 20 months and many patients discontinue the treatment due to leukemia progression or Richter transformation. Mutations affecting the C481 residue of BTK disrupt ibrutinib binding and have been characterized by us and others as the most common mechanism of ibrutinib resistance. Thus far, all described BTK mutations are located in its kinase domain and mutations outside this domain have never been described. Herein, we report a patient whose CLL progressed, was salvaged with ibrutinib and then relapsed. Serial analysis of samples throughout patient's clinical course identified a structurally novel mutation (BTKT316A) in the SH2 domain, but not kinase domain, of Bruton tyrosine kinase which was associated with disease relapse. Functionally, cells carrying BTKT316A show resistance to ibrutinib at both cellular and molecular levels to a similar extent as BTKC481S. Our study lends further insight into the diverse mechanisms of ibrutinib resistance that has important implications for the development of next-generation BTK inhibitors as well as mutation detection in relapsed patients.",cancer
1524,Cycling Stability of a VOx Nanotube Cathode in Mixture of Ethyl Acetate and Tetramethylsilane Based Electrolytes for Rechargeable Mg-Ion Batteries.,"The electrochemical cycling performance of vanadium oxide nanotubes (VOx-NTs) for Mg-ion insertion/extraction was investigated in acetonitrile (AN) and tetramethylsilane (TMS)-ethyl acetate (EA) electrolytes with Mg(ClO4)2 salt. When cycled in TMS-EA solution, the VOx-NT exhibited a higher capacity retention than when cycled in AN solution. The significant degradation of capacity in AN solution resulted from increased charge-transfer resistance caused by the reaction products of the electrolyte during cycling. Mixed TMS-EA solvent systems can increase the cell performance and stability of Mg-electrolytes owing to the higher stability of TMS towards oxidation and the strong Mg-coordination ability of EA. These results indicate that the interfacial stability of the electrolyte during the charging process plays a crucial role in determining the capacity retention of VOx-NT for Mg insertion/extraction.",nonCancer
49,The somatic affairs of BRAF: tailored therapies for advanced malignant melanoma and orphan non-V600E (V600R-M) mutations.,"BRAF V600R-M-D are uncommon mutations, not included in the experimental protocols of BRAF selective inhibitors. We report the evaluation of correlations among different types of BRAF somatic mutations in melanoma and their management with BRAF inhibitors. 21 patients with BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma were enrolled in the protocol with BRAF inhibitors for compassionate use at the University of Modena. Hot spot V600E mutations were found in 19 patients. V600R mutation and double (V600E -V600M) mutation were identified in two melanomas. In one case, V600K mutation was found. Two screening failures were noted. Mean progression free survival at follow-up of to 8 weeks, was 7.6 months. Five patients had a very short follow-up and the experimental protocol is still ongoing, so we cannot provide complete follow-up data. However, all of them are still under treatment and disease progression free. An objective response with few side effects was observed in all patients. in vitro studies with the aim of testing drug sensitivity.",cancer

438,UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A expression levels determine the response of colorectal cancer cells to the heat shock protein 90 inhibitor ganetespib.,"HSP90 inhibition represents a promising route to cancer therapy, taking advantage of cancer cell-inherent proteotoxic stress. The HSP90-inhibitor ganetespib showed benefit in advanced clinical trials. This raises the need to identify the molecular determinants of treatment response. We tested the efficacy of ganetespib on a series of colorectal cancer (CRC)-derived cell lines and correlated their sensitivities with comprehensive gene expression analysis. Notably, the drug concentration required for 50% growth inhibition (IC50) varied up to 70-fold (from 36 to 2500 nM) between different cell lines. Correlating cell line-specific IC50s with the corresponding gene expression patterns revealed a strong association between ganetespib resistance (IC50>500 nM) and high expression of the UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1A (UGT1A) gene cluster. Moreover, CRC tumor samples showed a comparable distribution of UGT1A expression levels. The members of the UGT1A gene family are known as drug-conjugating liver enzymes involved in drug excretion, but their function in tumor cells is hardly understood. Chemically unrelated HSP90 inhibitors, for example, 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG), did not show correlation of drug sensitivities with UGT1A levels, whereas the ganetespib-related compound NVP-AUY922 did. When the most ganetespib-resistant cell line, HT29, was treated with ganetespib, the levels of HSP90 clients were unaffected. However, HT29 cells became sensitized to the drug, and HSP90 client proteins were destabilized by ganetespib upon siRNA-mediated UGT1A knockdown. Conversely, the most ganetespib-sensitive cell lines HCT116 and SW480 became more tolerant toward ganetespib upon UGT1A overexpression. Mechanistically, ganetespib was rapidly glucuronidated and excreted in resistant but not in sensitive CRC lines. We conclude that CRC cell-expressed UGT1A inactivates ganetespib and other resorcinolic Hsp90 inhibitors by glucuronidation, which renders the drugs unable to inhibit Hsp90 and thereby abrogates their biological activity. UGT1A levels in tumor tissues may be a suitable predictive biomarker to stratify CRC patients for ganetespib treatment.",cancer
943,Combination cediranib and olaparib versus olaparib alone for women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer: a randomised phase 2 study.,"Olaparib is a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor and cediranib is an anti-angiogenic agent with activity against VEGF receptor (VEGFR) 1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3. Both oral agents have antitumour activity in women with recurrent ovarian cancer, and their combination was active and had manageable toxicities in a phase 1 trial. We investigated whether this combination could improve progression-free survival (PFS) compared with olaparib monotherapy in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer. In our randomised, open-label, phase 2 study, we recruited women (aged ≥18 years) who had measurable platinum-sensitive, relapsed, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, or those with deleterious germline BRCA1/2 mutations from nine participating US academic medical centres. We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to permuted blocks, stratified by germline BRCA status and previous anti-angiogenic therapy, to receive olaparib capsules 400 mg twice daily or the combination at the recommended phase 2 dose of cediranib 30 mg daily and olaparib capsules 200 mg twice daily. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival analysed in the intention-to-treat population. The phase 2 trial is no longer accruing patients. An interim analysis was conducted in November, 2013, after 50% of expected events had occurred and efficacy results were unmasked. The primary analysis was performed on March 31, 2014, after 47 events (66% of those expected). The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01116648. Between Oct 26, 2011, and June 3, 2013, we randomly allocated 46 women to receive olaparib alone and 44 to receive the combination of olaparib and cediranib. Median PFS was 17·7 months (95% CI 14·7-not reached) for the women treated with cediranib plus olaparib compared with 9·0 months (95% CI 5·7-16·5) for those treated with olaparib monotherapy (hazard ratio 0·42, 95% CI 0·23-0·76; p=0·005). Grade 3 and 4 adverse events were more common with combination therapy than with monotherapy, including fatigue (12 patients in the cediranib plus olaparib group vs five patients in the olaparib monotherapy group), diarrhoea (ten vs none), and hypertension (18 vs none). Cediranib plus olaparib seems to improve PFS in women with recurrent platinum-sensitive high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer, and warrants study in a phase 3 trial. The side-effect profile suggests such investigations should include assessments of quality of life and patient-reported outcomes to understand the effects of a continuing oral regimen with that of intermittent chemotherapy.

785,Long Term Survival and Continued Complete Response of Vemurafenib in a Metastatic Melanoma Patient with BRAF V600K Mutation.,"Introduction. BRAF kinase inhibitors such as Vemurafenib have shown improvement in overall survival, progression-free survival, and response rates in patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600K mutation. However, there were no cases of complete remission reported in patients with V600K mutation before. Case Presentation. A 53-year-old man with metastatic melanoma and dialysis dependent end stage renal failure was treated safely with Vemurafenib for a BRAF V600K mutation positive melanoma and the case was reported elsewhere. After a long follow-up of the same patient treated with Vemurafenib, a complete radiological response was observed and the renal functions remained stable throughout the treatment. Main toxicities reported were grade 1 photosensitivity and skin cancers. Vemurafenib was discontinued but patient remains disease free 12 months after stopping treatment and the clinical review is ongoing. Conclusion. This is the first reported case of complete radiological response to a BRAF inhibitor in metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600K mutation and remains disease free even after discontinuation of treatment. This also shows clinical safety of Vemurafenib in end stage renal failure and highlights the need for closer look at the subgroup of patients with BRAF V600K mutation and its tumour biology.",cancer

Some studies demonstrated that U-266 myeloma cell line and primary myeloma cells expressed RANK and RANKL. It had been reported that the expression of myeloid and monocytoid markers was increased by co-culturing myeloma cells with hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). This study also attempted to show the molecular mechanism of RANK and RANKL on differentiation capability of human cord blood HSC to osteoclast, as well as expression of calcitonin receptor (CTR) on cord blood HSC surface.|In this experimental study, CD133(+) hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from umbilical cord blood and cultured in the presence of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL.

1216,"Comparison of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib (BMS-354825), and nilotinib (AMN107) in an N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-based mutagenesis screen: high efficacy of drug combinations.","BMS-354825 (dasatinib) and AMN107 (nilotinib) are potent alternate Abl inhibitors with activity against many imatinib mesylate-resistant BCR-ABL kinase domain (KD) mutants, except T315I. We used N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU)-exposed Ba/F3-p210(BCR-ABL) cells to compare incidence and types of KD mutants emerging in the presence of imatinib mesylate, dasatinib, and nilotinib, alone and in dual combinations. Although ENU is expected to induce mutations in multiple proteins, resistant clones were almost exclusively BCR-ABL KD mutant at relevant concentrations of nilotinib and dasatinib, consistent with a central role of KD mutations for resistance to these drugs. Twenty different mutations were identified with imatinib mesylate, 10 with nilotinib (including only 1 novel mutation, E292V) and 9 with dasatinib. At intermediate drug levels the spectrum narrowed to F317V and T315I for dasatinib and Y253H, E255V, and T315I for nilotinib. Thus, cross-resistance is limited to T315I, which is also the only mutant isolated at drug concentrations equivalent to maximal achievable plasma trough levels. With drug combinations maximal suppression of resistant clone outgrowth was achieved at lower concentrations compared with single agents, suggesting that such combinations may be equipotent to higher-dose single agents. However, sequencing uniformly revealed T315I, consistent with the need for a T315I inhibitor, to completely block resistance.",cancer
2154,Closing yield gaps in China by empowering smallholder farmers.,"Sustainably feeding the world's growing population is a challenge, and closing yield gaps (that is, differences between farmers' yields and what are attainable for a given region) is a vital strategy to address this challenge. The magnitude of yield gaps is particularly large in developing countries where smallholder farming dominates the agricultural landscape. Many factors and constraints interact to limit yields, and progress in problem-solving to bring about changes at the ground level is rare. Here we present an innovative approach for enabling smallholders to achieve yield and economic gains sustainably via the Science and Technology Backyard (STB) platform. STB involves agricultural scientists living in villages among farmers, advancing participatory innovation and technology transfer, and garnering public and private support. We identified multifaceted yield-limiting factors involving agronomic, infrastructural, and socioeconomic conditions. When these limitations and farmers' concerns were addressed, the farmers adopted recommended management practices, thereby improving production outcomes. In one region in China, the five-year average yield increased from 67.9% of the attainable level to 97.0% among 71 leading farmers, and from 62.8% to 79.6% countywide (93,074 households); this was accompanied by resource and economic benefits.",nonCancer
2188,Mixed Monolayers of Spiropyrans Maximize Tunneling Conductance Switching by Photoisomerization at the Molecule-Electrode Interface in EGaIn Junctions.,"This paper describes the photo-induced switching of conductance in tunneling junctions comprising self-assembled monolayers of a spiropyran moiety using eutectic Ga-In top contacts. Despite separation of the spiropyran unit from the electrode by a long alkyl ester chain, we observe an increase in the current density J of a factor of 35 at 1 V when the closed form is irradiated with UV light to induce the ring-opening reaction, one of the highest switching ratios reported for junctions incorporating self-assembled monolayers. The magnitude of switching of hexanethiol mixed-monolayers was higher than that of pure spiropyran monolayers. The first switching event recovers 100% of the initial value of J and, in the mixed-monolayers, subsequent dampening is not the result of degradation of the monolayer. The observation of increased conductivity is supported by zero-bias DFT calculations showing a change in the localization of the density of states near the Fermi level as well as by simulated transmission spectra revealing positive resonances that broaden and shift towards the Fermi level in the open form.",nonCancer

734,KRAS G12D Mutation Subtype Is A Prognostic Factor for Advanced Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma.,"There is no molecular biomarker available in the clinical practice to assess the prognosis of advanced pancreatic carcinoma. This multicenter prospective study aimed to investigate the role of KRAS mutation subtypes within the primary tumor to determine the prognosis of advanced pancreatic cancer. The exon-2 KRAS mutation status was tested on endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy material (primary tumor; restriction fragment-length polymorphism plus sequencing and TaqMan allelic discrimination) of patients with proven locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma. We used the Kaplan-Meier method, log-rank test, and Cox's model to evaluate the impact of KRAS status on the overall survival (OS), adjusting for age, stage of disease, clinical performance status, CA 19-9 levels, and treatment. A total of 219 patients (men: 116; mean age: 67±9.4 years) were included: 147 harbored a codon-12 KRAS mutation (G12D: 73; G12V: 53; G12R: 21) and 72 had a wild-type KRAS. There was no difference in the OS between patients with a mutant KRAS (8 months; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 8.7-12.3) and the wild-type (9 months; 95% CI: 8.7-12.8; hazard ratio (HR): 1.03; P=0.82). However, the patients with a G12D mutation had a significantly shorter OS (6 months; 95% CI: 6.4-9.7) compared with the other patients (OS: 9 months; 95% CI: 10-13; HR: 1.47; P=0.003; i.e., wild type: 9 months, G12V: 9 months, G12R: 14 months). Similar results were observed in the subgroup of 162 patients who received chemotherapy (HR: 1.66; P=0.0013; G12D (n=49): 8 months, wild type (n=56): 10 months, G12V (n=38): 10 months, G12R (n=19): 14 months). Multivariate analyses identified KRAS G12D as an independent predictor for worse prognosis within the entire series (HR: 1.44; P=0.01) and in the subgroup of patients that received chemotherapy (HR: 1.84; P=0.02). The KRAS G12D mutation subtype is an independent prognostic marker for advanced pancreatic ductal carcinoma. Codon and amino-acid-specific mutations of KRAS should be considered when evaluating the prognoses as well as in trials testing drugs that target RAS and downstream RAS pathways.",cancer
2166,Mast cells promote melanoma colonization of lungs.,"Mast cells have been implicated in malignant processes, mainly through clinical correlative studies and by experiments performed using animals lacking mast cells due to defective c-kit signaling. However, mast cell-deficient mouse models based on c-kit defects have recently been questioned for their relevance. Here we addressed the effect of mast cells in a tumor setting by using transgenic Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice, in which the deficiency of mast cells is independent of c-kit defects. Melanoma cells (B16.F10) were administered either subcutaneously or intravenously into Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice or Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ littermate controls, followed by the assessment of formed tumors. In the subcutaneous model, mast cells were abundant in the tumor stroma of control mice but were absent in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ mice. However, the absence of mast cells did not affect tumor size. In contrast, after intravenous administration of B16.F10 cells, melanoma colonization of the lungs was markedly reduced in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals. Decreased melanoma colonization of the lungs in Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ animals was accompanied by increased inflammatory cell recruitment into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, suggesting that mast cells suppress inflammation in this setting. Further, qPCR analysis revealed significant alterations in the expression of Twist and E-cadherin in lungs of Mcpt5-Cre+ R-DTA+ vs. control Mcpt5-Cre- R-DTA+ animals, suggesting an impact of mast cells on epithelial-mesenchymal transition. In conclusion, this study reveals that mast cells promote melanoma colonization of the lung.",nonCancer

624,MicroRNA-218 is a prognostic indicator in colorectal cancer and enhances 5-fluorouracil-induced apoptosis by targeting BIRC5.,"One major reason for the failure of advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) treatment is the occurrence of chemoresistance to fluoropyrimidine (FU)-based chemotherapy. Various reports showed that ectopic expression and function of microRNAs (miRNAs) played key roles to mediate apoptosis at the post-transcriptional level. To further explore the possible mechanisms, we evaluated the prognostic effect of miR-218 in patients with CRC receiving 5-FU-based treatment and investigated the proapoptotic role of miR-218 in vitro. Primary tumour specimens and adjacent non-tumour sites were used to determine miR-218 expression distribution and explore its potential prognostic value in response to 5-FU-based treatment in patients with CRC. HCT116 and HT29 cells were transfected with precursor miR-218 or negative control, followed by assays to investigate its influence on apoptosis, cell proliferation and pathways involved in molecular mechanisms of chemoresistance to 5-FU. Results showed that high miR-218 expression was associated with positive response to firstline 5-FU treatment in CRC patients. MiR-218 promoted apoptosis, inhibited cell proliferation and caused cell cycle arrest in CRC cells by suppressing BIRC5 expression. Furthermore, miR-218 enhanced 5-FU cytotoxicity in CRC cells by suppressing the 5-FU targeted enzyme, thymidylate synthase (TS). In conclusion, we demonstrated that high miR-218 expression had a positive prognostic value in 5-FU-based treatments for CRC patients and discovered a novel mechanism mediated by miR-218 to promote apoptosis and to function synergistically with 5-FU to promote chemosensitivity by suppressing BIRC5 and TS in CRC. These suggest the unique potential of miR-218 as a novel candidate for developing miR-218-based therapeutic strategies in CRC.",cancer

We aimed to evaluate whether mutant forms of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) (mEGFR and mKRAS) are useful biomarkers in resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We retrospectively reviewed data from 841 patients who underwent surgery and molecular testing for NSCLC between 2007 and 2012. mEGFR was observed in 103 patients (12.2%), and mKRAS in 265 (31.5%). The median overall survival (OS) and time to recurrence (TTR) were significantly lower for mKRAS (OS: 43 months; TTR: 19 months) compared with mEGFR (OS: 67 months; TTR: 24 months) and wild-type patients (OS: 55 months; disease-free survival (DFS): 24 months). Patients with KRAS G12V exhibited worse OS and TTR compared with the entire cohort (OS: KRAS G12V: 26 months vs 60 months; DFS: KRAS G12V: 15 months vs 24 months). These results were confirmed using multivariate analyses (non-G12V status, hazard ratio (HR): 0.43 (confidence interval: 0.28-0.65), P<0.0001 for OS; HR: 0.67 (0.48-0.92), P=0.01 for TTR). Risk of recurrence was significantly lower for non-KRAS G12V (HR: 0.01, (0.001-0.08), P<0.0001). mKRAS and mEGFR may predict survival and recurrence in early stages of NSCLC.

Besides its relevance in the pathogenesis of the disease, this hybrid gene represents a specific tumor marker that is rapidly detectable by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in the RNA extracted from leukemic blasts. Several studies have highlighted the clinical relevance of PML/RAR alpha detection, which provides a specific diagnosis, prognostic information, and prediction of relapse when monitoring residual disease during the follow-up. In fact, this hybrid gene is detected in 100% of APLs. Rare cases of patients with a morphological diagnosis of FAB M3 AML who lack the specific PML/RAR alpha abnormality have been reported as being unresponsive to differentiation treatment. Finally, all the studies reported so far on PCR monitoring in APL have documented that the identification of small amounts of residual disease at remission strongly predicts impending relapse. Thus, RT-PCR of the hybrid PML/RAR alpha gene is currently performed prospectively as part of cooperative clinical trials aimed at better addressing post-remission treatment in APL.",cancer

Afatinib, an irreversible ERBB family blocker, has shown efficacy in a phase 2 study in this setting. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of afatinib compared with methotrexate as second-line treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC progressing on or after platinum-based therapy. In this open-label, phase 3, randomised controlled trial conducted in 101 centres in 19 countries, we enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with histologically or cytologically confirmed HNSCC that was recurrent, metastatic, or both who had progressed on or after first-line platinum-based therapy, were not amenable for salvage surgery or radiotherapy, and who had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. Previous treatment with more than one systemic regimen in this setting was not allowed; previous treatment with EGFR-targeted antibody therapy (but not EGFR-targeted tyrosine-kinase inhibitors) was allowed. We randomly assigned eligible patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) or intravenous methotrexate (40 mg/m(2) per week), stratified by ECOG performance status and previous EGFR-targeted antibody therapy for recurrent or metastatic disease.

Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment allocation; independent review of tumour response was done in a blinded manner. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival as assessed by an independent, central imaging review committee. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population and safety analyses were done in patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This ongoing study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01345682. Between Jan 10, 2012, and Dec 12, 2013, we enrolled 483 patients and randomly assigned 322 to afatinib and 161 to methotrexate. After a median follow-up of 6·7 months (IQR 3·1-9·0), progression-free survival was longer in the afatinib group than in the methotrexate group (median 2·6 months [95% CI 2·0-2·7] for the afatinib group vs 1·7 months [1·5-2·4] for the methotrexate group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·80 [95% CI 0·65-0·98], p=0·030). The most frequent grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse events were rash or acne (31 [10%] of 320 patients in the afatinib group vs none of 160 patients in the methotrexate group), diarrhoea (30 [9%] vs three [2%]), stomatitis (20 [6%] vs 13 [8%]), fatigue (18 [6%] vs five [3%]), and neutropenia (1 [<1%] vs 11 [7%]); serious adverse events occurred in 44 (14%) of afatinib-treated patients and 18 (11%) of methotrexate-treated patients. Afatinib was associated with significant improvements in progression-free survival and had a manageable safety profile. These findings provide important new insights into the treatment of this patient population and support further investigations with irreversible ERBB family blockers in HNSCC.

2247,Intraparotid Neurofibroma of the Facial Nerve: A Case Report.,"Intraparotid neurofibromas of the facial nerve are extremely rare and mostly associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).|This is a case of a healthy 40-year-old man, which underwent surgery for a preoperatively diagnosed benign parotid gland lesion. After identification of the facial nerve main trunk, a single large mass (6 x 3 cm) incorporating the upper nerve division was observed. The nerve portion involved in the mass could not be dissected and was inevitably sacrificed with immediate neuroraphy of the upper division of the facial nerve with 6/0 prolene. The final histopathology revealed the presence of a neurofibroma. Complete left side facial nerve paralysis was observed immediately postoperatively but the function of the lower half was returned within 4 months and the upper half was returned after 1 year. Currently, after 3 years of follow up, there are no signs of recurrence and normal facial nerve function is observed.|Neurofibroma should be considered as the diagnosis in a patient demonstrating a parotid mass. In cases where it is diagnosed intraoperatively, excision of part of the nerve with the mass will be inevitable though it can be successfully repaired by end to end anastomosis.",nonCancer
1798,Effects of Complementary Combination Therapy of Korean Red Ginseng and Antiviral Agents in Chronic Hepatitis B.,"Chronic hepatitis B management is commonly targeted at reducing viral replication. However, the currently available antiviral therapies are associated with some problems, including resistance and numerous adverse effects. Ginseng has been reported to be effective for treating viral infections such as influenza and human immunodeficiency virus. However, there are currently few studies on the effects of ginseng in chronic hepatitis B. Thus, this study investigated the effects of ginseng together with antiviral agents in chronic hepatitis B.|This was a prospective, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial, and single-center study. Thirty-eight patients were enrolled. The control group (n = 19) was administered antiviral agents alone. The experimental group (n = 19) was administered antiviral agents along with Korean Red Ginseng powder capsules (each dose is 1 gram (two capsules), a one-day dose is 3 grams). The baseline characteristics did not differ between the two groups. Differences in several non-invasive fibrosis serologic markers (type IV collagen, hyaluronic acid, transforming growth factor-β) and in the hepatitis B virus DNA levels were compared between the groups.|The non-invasive fibrosis serologic markers were further decreased in the experimental group, with significant differences after treatment observed for hyaluronic acid (p = 0.032) and transforming growth factor-β (p = 0.008), but not for type IV collagen (p = 0.174).|This study suggests the possibility of Korean Red Ginseng as a complementary therapy for chronic hepatitis B.",nonCancer
992,A common variant in MTHFR influences response to chemoradiotherapy and recurrence of rectal cancer.,"An important determinant of the pathogenesis and prognosis of various diseases is inherited genetic variation. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), variations at a single base position, have been identified in both protein-coding and noncoding DNA sequences, but the vast majority of millions of those variants are far from being functionally understood. Here we show that a common variant in the gene MTHFR [rs1801133 (C>T)] not only influences response to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer, but it also influences recurrence of the disease itself. More specifically, patients with the homozygous ancestral (wild type) genotype (C/C) were 2.91 times more likely (291% increased benefit) to respond to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy {95% CI: [1.23, 6.89]; P=0.0150} and 3.25 times more likely (325% increased benefit) not to experience recurrence of the disease {95% CI: [1.37, 7.72]; P=0.0079} than patients with either the heterozygous (C/T) or the homozygous mutation (T/T) genotype. These results identify MTHFR as an important genetic marker and open up new, pharmacogenomic strategies in the treatment and management of rectal cancer.",cancer
1759,Virtual Laboratory and Imaging: an online simulation tool to enhance hospital disaster preparedness training experience.,"Hospitals play a pivotal role as basic healthcare providers during mass casualty incidents (MCIs). Radiological studies and emergency laboratory test are of high importance for the management of hospital patients. However, it is known that during these events, they can generate significant bottlenecks. Appropriate request of such tests is of utmost importance to not generate delays in the patient flow. The aim of this paper is to describe a software designed to increase the realism of hospital-based MCI training through a realistic reproduction of radiology and laboratory departments.|In this paper, we present a Virtual Laboratory and Imaging system that we designed with the goal of increasing the realism of full-scale mass casualty simulations. The system is able to dynamically manage the speed and load of virtual departments while collecting data on usage and load, and provide data useful for the after-event debriefing. We tested this system in two pilot simulations involving, respectively, 105 and 89 simulated casualties.|The system, by measuring the number of requests and exams' turnaround time, enabled an objective measurement of the laboratory and radiology workload during simulated MCIs. It was possible to identify bottlenecks and consequently use these data for after-action debriefing.|The tool not only increased the simulation realism by adding the radiology and laboratory departments but also provided valuable data that could be used for educational and organizational purposes.",nonCancer
343,MET amplification leads to gefitinib resistance in lung cancer by activating ERBB3 signaling.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib are effective treatments for lung cancers with EGFR activating mutations, but these tumors invariably develop drug resistance. Here, we describe a gefitinib-sensitive lung cancer cell line that developed resistance to gefitinib as a result of focal amplification of the MET proto-oncogene. inhibition of MET signaling in these cells restored their sensitivity to gefitinib. MET amplification was detected in 4 of 18 (22%) lung cancer specimens that had developed resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib. We find that amplification of MET causes gefitinib resistance by driving ERBB3 (HER3)-dependent activation of PI3K, a pathway thought to be specific to EGFR/ERBB family receptors. Thus, we propose that MET amplification may promote drug resistance in other ERBB-driven cancers as well.",cancer
182,Exon 19 deletion mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor are associated with prolonged survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with gefitinib or erlotinib.,"Somatic mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been detected in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and are associated with sensitivity to treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. Our study explored the relationship between the two most common types of somatic EGFR mutations, exon 19 deletions and the L858R point mutation, and outcomes of patients following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib. Tumor specimens obtained before treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib were analyzed for EGFR mutations. Patients with exon 19 deletion or L858R mutations were identified. The response rate, time to progression, and overall survival were determined for the two groups. We identified 36 patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation who were treated with gefitinib or erlotinib. Patients with an exon 19 deletion had a significantly longer overall survival compared with patients with an L858R mutation (38 versus 17 months; P = 0.04). There were also trends toward higher response rate (73% versus 50%) and improved time to progression (24 versus 10 months) for the patients with an exon 19 deletion, although these were not independently significant in a multivariate analysis. A difference in response rate for patients treated with gefitinib compared with erlotinib was also noted [18 of 23 (78%) versus 3 of 9 (33%); P = 0.04]. No obvious difference in time to progression or overall survival was noted between gefitinib- and erlotinib-treated patients. Patients with NSCLC and EGFR exon 19 deletions have a longer survival following treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib compared with those with the L858R mutation. Pooling of greater numbers of patients and completion of prospective trials are needed to further define the predictive and prognostic roles of different EGFR mutations with respect to treatment with gefitinib, erlotinib, and other EGFR inhibitors.",cancer

Its potential anticancer activity has been validated in preclinical in vitro and in vivo models. We studied the activity of IPI-504 after epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in patients with advanced, molecularly defined non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC, prior treatment with EGFR TKIs, and tumor tissue available for molecular genotyping were enrolled in this prospective, nonrandomized, multicenter, phase II study of IPI-504 monotherapy. The primary outcome was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary aims included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and analysis of activity by molecular subtypes. Seventy-six patients were enrolled between December 2007 and May 2009 from 10 United States cancer centers. An ORR of 7% (five of 76) was observed in the overall study population, 10% (four of 40) in patients who were EGFR wild-type, and 4% (one of 28) in those with EGFR mutations. Although both EGFR groups were below the target ORR of 20%, among the three patients with an ALK gene rearrangement, two had partial responses and the third had prolonged stable disease (7.2 months, 24% reduction in tumor size). The most common adverse events included grades 1 and 2 fatigue, nausea, and diarrhea. Grade 3 or higher liver function abnormalities were observed in nine patients (11.8%). IPI-504 has clinical activity in patients with NSCLC, particularly among patients with ALK rearrangements.",cancer

Recently, different polymorphisms in the mdr-1 gene have been identified and their consequences for the function of P-glycoprotein, as well as for the treatment response to P-glycoprotein substrates, are being clarified. We analyzed the allelic frequencies at polymorphic sites G2677T/A and C3435T in ovarian cancer patients with good or poor response to treatment with paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin in order to evaluate their predictive values. Fifty-three patients were included in the study; 28 of them had been relapse-free for at least 1 year and 25 had progressive disease or relapsed within 12 months. A reference material consisting of 200 individuals was also analyzed. The genotypes of each single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) were determined using Pyrosequencing. The G2677T/A SNP was found to significantly correlate with treatment outcome. The probability of responding to paclitaxel treatment was higher in homozygously mutated patients (T/T or T/A; Fisher's exact test; P < 0.05). The frequency of the T or A alleles was also higher in the group of patients who had a good response (P < 0.05). There was also a dose-dependent influence of the number of mutated alleles on the response to paclitaxel treatment (chi2 test for linear-by-linear association; P = 0.03). However, the C3435T SNP was not found to correlate to treatment outcome. The mdr-1 polymorphism G2677T/A in exon 21 correlates with the paclitaxel response in ovarian cancer and may be important for the function of P-glycoprotein and resistance to paclitaxel and provide useful information for individualized therapy.",cancer

A 1:1:1 propensity-matched analysis of 5760 patients was performed to compare in-hospital outcomes among patients with S-ICD with those of patients with single-chamber (SC)-ICD and dual-chamber (DC)-ICD.|Analysis of trends in S-ICD adoption as a function of total ICD implants and comparison of in-hospital outcomes (death, complications, and defibrillation threshold [DFT] testing) among S-ICD and TV-ICD recipients.|Of the 393 734 ICD implants evaluated during the study period, 3717 were S-ICDs (0.9%). A total of 109 445 (27.8%) of the patients were female; the mean (SD) age was 67.03 (13.10) years. Use of ICDs increased from 0.2% during the fourth quarter of 2012 to 1.9% during the first quarter of 2015. Compared with SC-ICD and DC-ICD recipients, those with S-ICDs were more often younger, female, black, undergoing dialysis, and had experienced prior cardiac arrest. Among 2791 patients with S-ICD who underwent DFT testing, 2588 (92.7%), 2629 (94.2%), 2635 (94.4%), and 2784 (99.7%) were successfully defibrillated (≤65, ≤70, ≤75, and ≤80 J, respectively). In the propensity-matched analysis of 5760 patients, in-hospital complication rates associated with S-ICDs (0.9%) were comparable to those of SC-ICDs (0.6%) (P = .27) and DC-ICD rates (1.5%) (P = .11). Mean (SD) length of stay after S-ICD implantation was comparable to that after SC-ICD implantation (1.1 [1.5] vs 1.0 [1.2] days; P = .77) and less than after DC-ICD implantation (1.1 [1.5] vs 1.2 [1.5] days; P < .001).|The use of S-ICDs is rapidly increasing in the United States.

756,ALK mutations confer differential oncogenic activation and sensitivity to ALK inhibition therapy in neuroblastoma.,"Genetic studies have established anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), a cell surface receptor tyrosine kinase, as a tractable molecular target in neuroblastoma. We describe comprehensive genomic, biochemical, and computational analyses of ALK mutations across 1,596 diagnostic neuroblastoma samples. ALK tyrosine kinase domain mutations occurred in 8% of samples--at three hot spots and 13 minor sites--and correlated significantly with poorer survival in high- and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma. Biochemical and computational studies distinguished oncogenic (constitutively activating) from nononcogenic mutations and allowed robust computational prediction of their effects. The mutated variants also showed differential in vitro crizotinib sensitivities. Our studies identify ALK genomic status as a clinically important therapeutic stratification tool in neuroblastoma and will allow tailoring of ALK-targeted therapy to specific mutations.",cancer
994,The HOXB13 G84E Mutation Is Associated with an Increased Risk for Prostate Cancer and Other Malignancies.,"A rare nonconservative substitution (G84E) in the HOXB13 gene has been shown to be associated with risk of prostate cancer. DNA samples from male patients included in the Mayo Clinic Biobank (MCB) were genotyped to determine the frequency of the G84E mutation and its association with various cancers. Subjects were genotyped using a custom TaqMan (Applied Biosystems) assay for G84E (rs138213197). In addition to donating a blood specimen, all MCB participants completed a baseline questionnaire to collect information on medical history and family history of cancer. Forty-nine of 9,012 male patients were carriers of G84E (0.5%). Thirty-one percent (n = 2,595) of participants had been diagnosed with cancer, including 51.1% of G84E carriers compared with just 30.6% of noncarriers (P = 0.004). G84E was most frequently observed among men with prostate cancer compared with men without cancer (P < 0.0001). However, the mutation was also more commonly observed in men with bladder cancer (P = 0.06) and leukemia (P = 0.01). G84E carriers were more likely to have a positive family history of prostate cancer in a first-degree relative compared to noncarriers (36.2% vs. 16.0%, P = 0.0003). Our study confirms the association between the HOXB13 G84E variant and prostate cancer and suggests a novel association between G84E and leukemia and a suggestive association with bladder cancer. Future investigation is warranted to confirm these associations in order to improve our understanding of the role of germline HOXB13 mutations in human cancer. The associations between HOXB13 and prostate, leukemia, and bladder suggest that this gene is important in carcinogenesis.",cancer
537,Complete loss of STAG2 expression is an indicator of good prognosis in patients with bladder cancer.,"Stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) is an important member of cohesin, a conserved complex holding the sister chromatid together. Recent whole-genome sequencing studies have identified that genetic alterations of stag2 are common in bladder cancer (BC). The prognostic implications of STAG2 expression in BC remain unclear; we therefore analyzed its associations with the histopathological characteristics and clinical outcome in a Chinese population. We used immunohistochemistry assay to determine STAG2 protein expression in tumor tissues from 125 BC patients. STAG2 expression was analyzed according to clinicopathological features and patients' survival. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to identify predictors for recurrence-free survival (RFS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). STAG2 expression was detected in 79.2 % of BC tissues, and 20.8 % of the tumor tissues had a complete loss of STAG2 protein expression. This STAG2-negative result was associated with a lower tumor histological grade with P = 0.009. The log-rank analysis revealed that the complete loss of STAG2 expression was associated with a lower risk of recurrence (P = 0.023) and a diminished risk of death (P = 0.034), especially in the subgroup of muscle-invasive BC (P = 0.043 for RFS and P = 0.087 for CSS). In multivariable Cox regression models, the loss of STAG2 expression remained a beneficial factor for RFS and CSS of BC patients. Univariate and multivariate analyses' results indicated that the complete loss of STAG2 expression was predictive for better RFS and CSS, suggesting its potential value as a prognostic biomarker.",cancer
333,Inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase pathway for the treatment of patients with metastatic metaplastic breast cancer.,"Mesenchymal/metaplastic breast cancers (MpBCs) are often triple-negative (TNBC), and chemo-refractory, and can harbor phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3kinase) alterations; thus, therapy with mTor inhibitors may demonstrate activity. Patients with mesenchymal/MpBC treated with temsirolimus-based regimens were evaluated. Mutational analyses [polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based DNA sequencing method, mass spectrometric detection (Sequenom MassARRAY), or next-generation sequencing] as well as loss of phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) (immunohistochemistry) were performed (archived tissue when available). Twenty-three patients (one of whom was on two separate trials) were treated using temsirolimus-containing regimens: temsirolimus alone (n = 1 patient) or combined with the following: liposomal doxorubicin and bevacizumab (DAT, n = 18); liposomal doxorubicin (DT, n = 1); paclitaxel and bevacizumab (TAT, n = 2); paclitaxel (TT, n = 1); carboplatin and bevacizumab (CAT, n = 1). Response rate [complete response (CR) + partial response (PR)] was 25% across all regimens; 32% in the anthracycline-based regimens [DAT and DT (CR = 2, PR = 4; N = 19)]. An additional two patients achieved stable disease (SD) ≥6 months [total SD ≥6 months/CR/PR = 8 (33%)]. Molecular aberrations in the PI3K pathway were common: PIK3CA mutation = 6/15 (40%), PTEN mutation = 3/11 (27%), and PTEN loss = 2/11 (18%). A point mutation in the NF2 gene (K159fs*16; NF2 alterations can activate mTor) was found in one patient who attained CR (3+ years). Of the eight patients who achieved SD ≥6 months/CR/PR, all 4 patients with available tissue had a molecular aberration that activate the PIK3CA/Akt/mTOR axis: PIK3CA mutation = 2; PTEN loss = 1; NF2 aberration = 1. DAT has activity in MpBCs including complete CRs. Molecular aberrations that can activate the PI3 K/Akt/mTOR axis are common in MpBC.",cancer
383,Genomic Correlate of Exceptional Erlotinib Response in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"Randomized clinical trials demonstrate no benefit for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in unselected patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, a patient with stage IVA HNSCC received 13 days of neoadjuvant erlotinib and experienced a near-complete histologic response. To determine a mechanism of exceptional response to erlotinib therapy in HNSCC. Single patient with locally advanced HNSCC who received erlotinib monotherapy in a window-of-opportunity clinical trial (patients scheduled to undergo primary cancer surgery are treated briefly with an investigational agent). Whole-exome sequencing of pretreatment tumor and germline patient samples was performed at a quaternary care academic medical center, and a candidate somatic variant was experimentally investigated for mediating erlotinib response. A brief course of erlotinib monotherapy followed by surgical resection. Identification of pretreatment tumor somatic alterations that may contribute to the exceptional response to erlotinib. Hypotheses were formulated regarding enhanced erlotinib response in preclinical models harboring the patient tumor somatic variant MAPK1 E322K following the identification of tumor somatic variants. No EGFR alterations were observed in the pretreatment tumor DNA. Paradoxically, the tumor harbored an activating MAPK1 E322K mutation (allelic fraction 0.13), which predicts ERK activation and erlotinib resistance in EGFR-mutant lung cancer. The HNSCC cells with MAPK1 E322K exhibited enhanced EGFR phosphorylation and erlotinib sensitivity compared with wild-type MAPK1 cells. Selective erlotinib use in HNSCC may be informed by precision oncology approaches.",cancer
1105,hVps37A Status affects prognosis and cetuximab sensitivity in ovarian cancer.,"Although prognostic and predictive factors in ovarian cancer have been extensively studied for decades, only few have been identified and introduced to clinical practice. Here, we evaluate hVps37A (HCRP1) as a possible novel predictive marker for ovarian cancer. hVps37A was originally described as a member of the membrane-trafficking ESCRT-I complex mediating the internalization and degradation of ubiquitinated membrane receptors. We analyzed an ovarian cancer tissue microarray for HCRP1, EGFR, and HER2 expression. We used a tetracycline inducible ovarian cancer cell culture model to show the effects of hVps37A knockdown in vitro and in vivo. In addition, we studied the effects of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors cetuximab and lapatinib on ovarian cancer cells under conditions of hVps37A knockdown. We find that hVps37A is significantly downregulated in ovarian cancer and modifies the prognostic value of EGFR and HER2 expression. In addition, hVps37A downregulation in ovarian cancer cells leads to cytoplasmic pEGFR retention and hyperactivation of downstream pathways and is associated with enhanced xenograft growth in nude mice and invasion of the collagen matrix. Furthermore, due to subsequent sustained Akt- and MAPK-pathway activation, hVps37A-deficient cells become irresponsive to inhibition by the therapeutic antibody cetuximab. We propose that hVps37A status could become a novel prognostic and therapeutic marker for EGFR or HER2 driven tumors.",cancer
55,BRAFV600E mutation and its association with clinicopathological features of colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying causative genetic mutations. The B-type Raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) plays an important role in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascade during CRC. The presence of BRAFV600E mutation can determine the response of a tumor to chemotherapy. However, the association between the BRAFV600E mutation and the clinicopathological features of CRC remains controversial. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on the clinicopathological characteristics of CRC. We identified studies that examined the effect of BRAFV600E mutation on CRC within the PubMed, ISI Science Citation Index, and Embase databases. The effect of BRAFV600E on outcome parameters was estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each study using a fixed effects or random effects model. 25 studies with a total of 11,955 CRC patients met inclusion criteria. The rate of BRAFV600 was 10.8% (1288/11955). The BRAFV600E mutation in CRC was associated with advanced TNM stage, poor differentiation, mucinous histology, microsatellite instability (MSI), CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). This mutation was also associated with female gender, older age, proximal colon, and mutL homolog 1 (MLH1) methylation. This meta-analysis demonstrated that BRAFV600E mutation was significantly correlated with adverse pathological features of CRC and distinct clinical characteristics. These data suggest that BRAFV600E mutation could be used to supplement standard clinical and pathological staging for the better management of individual CRC patients, and could be considered as a poor prognostic marker for CRC.",cancer
1380,An XPA gene splicing mutation resulting in trace protein expression in an elderly xeroderma pigmentosum group A patient without neurological abnormalities.,"A certain relationship between XPA gene mutations and the severity of symptoms has been observed in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum group A (XP-A). Patients with mutations within the DNA-binding domain usually exhibit severe symptoms, whereas splicing mutations in the same domain sometimes cause very mild symptoms. This inconsistency can be explained by a small amount of functional XPA protein produced from normally spliced transcripts. We herein report the case of an adult Japanese XP-A patient with unusually mild symptoms. We identified a homozygous c.529G>A mutation in exon 4 of the XPA gene, which resulted in aberrant splicing with a 29-bp deletion in exon 4 causing a frameshift. Intact mRNA was observable, but a Western blot analysis failed to detect any normal XPA protein. We therefore evaluated the DNA repair capacity in normal cells in which the XPA expression was artificially diminished. The repair capacity was still present in cells with trace levels of the XPA protein. The repair capacity of the cells derived from our patient with mild symptoms was poor by comparison, but still significant compared to that of the cells derived from an XP-A patient with severe symptoms. These results provide strong evidence that a trace level of XPA protein can still exert a relatively strong repair capacity, resulting in only a mild phenotype.

1384,"The Storytelling Aspect of Interpersonal Relations: Understanding ""Relating"" from a Mentalization Point of View.","Improving a patient's ability to form and maintain satisfactory interpersonal relations is an important goal in many therapies. A mentalization-based approach to treatment is ideally suited to achieve this end to the extent it's designed to help improve a patient's ability to form more nuanced guesses about why others act as they do, based on a more accurate ""read"" of that individual's beliefs and desires. Interpersonal difficulties often issue when patients remain insistent on their own interpretation of another's motives that fly in the face of that individual's understanding of what is ""driving"" them. Helping patients explore the basis upon which they'd formed their conclusions about others goes a ways toward opening their mind to the possibility that things are a bit more complicated than first imaged. This in turn leads to greater curiosity and willingness to explore their own narratives and perceptions.",nonCancer
444,The RAC1 P29S hotspot mutation in melanoma confers resistance to pharmacological inhibition of RAF.,"Following mutations in BRAF and NRAS, the RAC1 c.85C>T single-nucleotide variant (SNV) encoding P29S amino acid change represents the next most frequently observed protein-coding hotspot mutation in melanoma. However, the biologic and clinical significance of the RAC1 P29S somatic mutation in approximately 4% to 9% of patients remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that melanoma cell lines possessing the RAC1 hotspot variant are resistant to RAF inhibitors (vemurafenib and dabrafenib). Enforced expression of RAC1 P29S in sensitive BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines confers resistance manifested by increased viability, decreased apoptosis, and enhanced tumor growth in vivo upon treatment with RAF inhibitors. Conversely, RNAi-mediated silencing of endogenous RAC1 P29S in a melanoma cell line with a co-occurring BRAF V600 mutation increased sensitivity to vemurafenib and dabrafenib. Our results suggest RAC1 P29S status may offer a predictive biomarker for RAF inhibitor resistance in melanoma patients, where it should be evaluated clinically.",cancer

The prognostic value of HEF1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to assess the association between the expression of HEF1, the clinical/pathological parameters and survival in HCC. In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the protein expression of HEF1 in 123 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their adjacent normal liver tissues. Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression model were used to analyze the data. Overexpression of HEF1 protein was observed in HCC tissue when compared with their adjacent non-malignant liver tissue. High expression of HEF1 correlated with higher advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion (P<0.05). In univariate and multivariate analysis, the expression of HEF1 was identified as an independent prognostic factor in the 123 patients with HCC. In subgroup analysis, high expression of HEF1 correlated with a poorer prognosis in advanced (TNM III+IV) stages (P<0.05). These findings demonstrated the potential value of detecting the expression of HEF1 by immunohistochemistry as a prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with HCC.",cancer
2206,Use of procalcitonin in clinical oncology: a literature review.,"The use of procalcitonin (PCT) as an early marker of infectious episodes in cancer patients is still controversial. We performed a MEDLINE search of peer-reviewed articles published between January 1990 and December 2015, and finally we analysed 15 articles. PCT seems to have a good diagnostic value of infectious episodes in cancer patients and its accuracy seems greater if we consider major events, such as bloodstream infections and sepsis. Serial evaluations of this protein seem to be more accurate in the diagnostic phase and useful to predict outcome and response to antibacterial treatment. On the other hand, some issues have yet to be solved, such as the use of a validated method of determination, the definition of a standard cut-off, and the heterogeneity among different settings of patients (e.g. early versus advanced-stage cancer, or haematological versus solid tumours). However, it is credible to think that PCT use in everyday clinical practice, preferably in combination with other clinical or laboratory tests, might be of help in finding and detecting early infectious complications in cancer patients.",nonCancer
94,Advanced ovarian cancer: what should be the standard of care?,"The standard treatment of advanced ovarian cancer is rapidly changing. As we begin to understand that epithelial ovarian cancer is a heterogeneous disease, our treatment strategies are evolving to include novel biologic drugs that specifically exploit altered pathways. Surgery remains an essential component in the treatment of ovarian cancer; however, the importance of surgical specialization and defining ""optimal cytoreduction"" as no visible residual disease has been further validated. Ongoing studies are defining the role of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the upfront treatment of advanced ovarian cancer. In addition, clinical trials are evaluating intraperitoneal, dose dense, antiangiogenic drugs as well as targeted maintenance therapies which will establish new standards of care in the near future.",cancer
1634,Monitoring interferon β treatment response with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis.,"The aim of this study is to compare the white matter of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients with healthy controls and to monitor the response to the treatment with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).Fifteen healthy controls and 36 recently diagnosed MS patients never treated with interferon β were included in this study. In the patient group, MRS was performed before treatment, at 6th and 12th month after the initiation of treatment and once in control group. Patient group was divided into 3 interferon groups randomly. Physical examination findings were recorded as Expanded Disability Status Scale scores before treatment, at 6th and 12th month of interferon treatment.At the end of 1 year follow up, 26 of 36 patients completed the study. In patients' white matter lesions, N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) ratios were lower than control group's white matters. NAA/Cr ratios were higher in control group's white matter than patient's normal appearing white matter but this difference was not statistically significant. There was no difference in choline/creatine (Cho/Cr) ratios between 2 groups. In follow-up period, NAA/Cr and Cho/Cr ratios obtained from patients' white matter lesions and normal appearing white matter did not change statistically.This study showed that in MS patients' white matters, especially in white matter lesions, neuron viability is reduced compared with healthy controls' normal white matter; and in the patients treated with interferon β NAA/Cr ratios remained stable. These stable levels of metabolite ratios in the patients who received interferon β therapy can be explained with either the shortness of the follow-up period post-treatment or may reflect a positive effect of the beta interferon therapy on the progress of MS.",nonCancer
2440,Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma of the spleen: A case report and review of the literature.,"Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma (FDCS), which originates in antigen-presenting cells of the B-cell follicles of the lymph nodes, is an uncommon disease, particularly in a splenic location. In a number of cases, FDCS may easily be confused with other solid tumors and be underdiagnosed. The present study reports a case in which such as tumor occurred in a 64-year-old woman. The patient presented with an abdominal mass, and computed tomography was performed. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed a diagnosis of FDCS. The patient underwent surgical treatment and had a good remission. At the time of writing, the patient was in good condition. The present study also discusses the clinical characteristics, treatment methods and prognosis of FDCS, with particular reference to the main points of the imaging diagnosis.",nonCancer
960,Reversible and adaptive resistance to BRAF(V600E) inhibition in melanoma.,"Treatment of BRAF(V600E) mutant melanoma by small molecule drugs that target the BRAF or MEK kinases can be effective, but resistance develops invariably. In contrast, colon cancers that harbour the same BRAF(V600E) mutation are intrinsically resistant to BRAF inhibitors, due to feedback activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Here we show that 6 out of 16 melanoma tumours analysed acquired EGFR expression after the development of resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors. Using a chromatin-regulator-focused short hairpin RNA (shRNA) library, we find that suppression of sex determining region Y-box 10 (SOX10) in melanoma causes activation of TGF-β signalling, thus leading to upregulation of EGFR and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-β (PDGFRB), which confer resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors. Expression of EGFR in melanoma or treatment with TGF-β results in a slow-growth phenotype with cells displaying hallmarks of oncogene-induced senescence. However, EGFR expression or exposure to TGF-β becomes beneficial for proliferation in the presence of BRAF or MEK inhibitors. In a heterogeneous population of melanoma cells having varying levels of SOX10 suppression, cells with low SOX10 and consequently high EGFR expression are rapidly enriched in the presence of drug, but this is reversed when the drug treatment is discontinued. We find evidence for SOX10 loss and/or activation of TGF-β signalling in 4 of the 6 EGFR-positive drug-resistant melanoma patient samples. Our findings provide a rationale for why some BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant melanoma patients may regain sensitivity to these drugs after a 'drug holiday' and identify patients with EGFR-positive melanoma as a group that may benefit from re-treatment after a drug holiday.",cancer
928,The AXL receptor tyrosine kinase is associated with adverse prognosis and distant metastasis in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is a frequently recurrent deadly cancer for which no efficient targeted drug exists. AXL is an adverse prognostic factor in some cancers. Strong clinical evidence to support the prognostic role of AXL in ESCC is lacking. A total of 116 patients diagnosed with operable primary ESCC were enrolled. Both AXL and HER2 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in esophageal tissue and were correlated with the clinical outcome of patients. The efficacy of the AXL targeted drug foretinib was also evaluated in ESCC cells. Expression of AXL was found in about 80 % of ESCC tissue, and was significantly correlated with progression of tumor (P<0.001), increased risk of death (Hazard ratio HR [95 % CI=2.09[1.09-4.04], P=0.028], and distant metastasis (odds ratio OR [95 %CI]=3.96 (1.16-13.60), P=0.029). The adverse clinical impact of AXL was more evident when cumulatively expressed with HER2. In cell model, ESCC cells were more sensitive to AXL inhibitor foretinib than to the HER2 inhibitor lapatinib. Meanwhile, the AXL inhibitor foretinib showed a synergistic effect with HER2 inhibitors and the potential to overcome drug resistance to lapatinib. We thus concluded that AXL is a strong adverse prognostic factor for ESCC. Therapeutic agents targeting AXL have great potential to improve prognosis of ESCC patients.",cancer
549,Receptor tyrosine kinases exert dominant control over PI3K signaling in human KRAS mutant colorectal cancers.,"Therapies inhibiting receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are effective against some human cancers when they lead to simultaneous downregulation of PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling. However, mutant KRAS has the capacity to directly activate ERK and PI3K signaling, and this is thought to underlie the resistance of KRAS mutant cancers to RTK inhibitors. Here, we have elucidated the molecular regulation of both the PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways in KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cells and identified combination therapies that lead to robust cancer cell apoptosis. KRAS knockdown using shRNA suppressed ERK signaling in all of the human KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines examined. However, no decrease, and actually a modest increase, in AKT phosphorylation was often seen. By performing PI3K immunoprecipitations, we determined that RTKs, often IGF-IR, regulated PI3K signaling in the KRAS mutant cell lines. This conclusion was also supported by the observation that specific RTK inhibition led to marked suppression of PI3K signaling and biochemical assessment of patient specimens. Interestingly, combination of RTK and MEK inhibitors led to concomitant inhibition of PI3K and MEK signaling, marked growth suppression, and robust apoptosis of human KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro and upon xenografting in mice. These findings provide a framework for utilizing RTK inhibitors in the treatment of KRAS mutant colorectal cancers.",cancer
1782,Gold deposited on a Ge(0 0 1) surface: DFT calculations.,"The atomic geometry, stability and electronic properties of self-organized Au induced nanowires on a Ge(0 0 1) surface are investigated based on the density-functional theory in the generalized gradient approximation and the stoichiometry of Au. According to the formation energy and the simulated STM image, the Ge atoms substituted by the Au atoms have been confirmed as occurring at a Au coverage lower than 0.25 Ml. The STM image with single and double dimer vacancies looks like the Au atoms have penetrated the subsurface. The energetically favorable dimer-row arrayed structures at 0.50 Ml and 0.75 Ml Au coverages have a 4  ×  1, 4  ×  2 or c(8  ×  2) transition symmetry, which comprise a flat Au-Au homodimer row and an alternating various buckling phase Ge-Ge or Au-Ge dimer row. The c(8  ×  2) zigzag-shaped protruding chains of shallow-groove STM images are highly consistent with the observations, but a long-range order dimer-row arrayed structure formation requires sufficient mobile energy to complete mass transport of the substituted Ge atoms in order to avoid the re-adsorption of these atoms; otherwise a deep-groove structure reconstruction is sequentially formed. A quasi-1D electron-like energy trough aligns in the direction perpendicular to the nanowire of the dimer-row arrayed structure in the c(8  ×  2) phase on a 0.75 Ml Au/Ge(0 0 1) surface, which is contributed by the Au-Ge dimer rows and the subsurface Ge atoms below them. The bottom energy of the energy trough is consistent with angle-resolved photo-emission spectroscopy studies (Schäfer et al 2008 Phys. Rev. Lett. 101 236802, Meyer et al 2011 Phys. Rev.

73,Distribution and levels of cell surface expression of CD33 and CD123 in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Owing to the more recent positive results with the anti-CD33 immunotoxin gemtuzumab ozogamicin, therapy against acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs) targeting CD33 holds many promises. Here, CD33 and CD123 expression on AML blasts was studied by flow cytometry in a cohort of 319 patients with detailed information on French-American-British/World Health Organization (FAB/WHO) classification, cytogenetics and molecular aberrations. AMLs of 87.8% express CD33 and would therefore be targetable with anti-CD33 therapies. Additionally, 9.4% of AMLs express CD123 without concomitant CD33 expression. Thus, nearly all AMLs could be either targeted via CD33 or CD123. Simultaneous presence of both antigens was observed in 69.5% of patients. Most importantly, even AMLs with adverse cytogenetics express CD33 and CD123 levels comparable to those with favorable and intermediate subtypes. Some patient groups with unfavorable alterations, such as FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD) mutations, high FLT3-ITD mutant/wild-type ratios and monosomy 5 are even characterized by high expression of CD33 and CD123. In addition, blasts of patients with mutant nucleophosmin (NPM1) revealed significantly higher CD33 and CD123 expression pointing toward the possibility of minimal residual disease-guided interventions in mutated NPM1-positive AMLs. These results stimulate the development of novel concepts to redirect immune effector cells toward CD33- and CD123-expressing blasts using bi-specific antibodies or engineered T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors.",cancer
1061,"Phase I Dose-Escalation Study of JNJ-42756493, an Oral Pan-Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor, in Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors.","JNJ-42756493 is an orally administered pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor. This first-in-human study evaluates the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics and defines the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of JNJ-42756493. Eligible patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of JNJ-42756493 from 0.5 to 12 mg administered continuously daily or JNJ-42756493 10 or 12 mg administered intermittently (7 days on/7 days off). Sixty-five patients were enrolled. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included hyperphosphatemia (65%), asthenia (55%), dry mouth (45%), nail toxicity (35%), constipation (34%), decreased appetite (32%), and dysgeusia (31%). Twenty-seven patients (42%) experienced grade ≥ 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, and one dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 ALT elevation was observed at 12 mg daily. Maximum-tolerated dose was not defined. Nine milligrams daily was considered as the initial RP2D; however, tolerability was improved with intermittent schedules, and 10 mg administered on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule was considered the final RP2D. Pharmacokinetics were linear, dose proportional, and predictable, with a half-life of 50 to 60 hours. Dose-dependent elevations in serum phosphate, a manifestation of pharmacodynamic effect, occurred in all patients starting at 4 mg daily. Among 23 response-evaluable patients with tumor FGFR pathway alterations, four confirmed responses and one unconfirmed partial response were observed in patients with glioblastoma and urothelial and endometrial cancer (all with FGFR2 or FGFR3 translocations); 16 patients had stable disease. JNJ-42756493 administered at 10 mg on a 7-days-on/7-days-off schedule achieved exposures at which clinical responses were observed, demonstrated pharmacodynamic biomarker activity, and had a manageable safety profile.",cancer
449,Phase III study of afatinib or cisplatin plus pemetrexed in patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations.,"The LUX-Lung 3 study investigated the efficacy of chemotherapy compared with afatinib, a selective, orally bioavailable ErbB family blocker that irreversibly blocks signaling from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/ErbB1), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/ErbB2), and ErbB4 and has wide-spectrum preclinical activity against EGFR mutations. A phase II study of afatinib in EGFR mutation-positive lung adenocarcinoma demonstrated high response rates and progression-free survival (PFS). In this phase III study, eligible patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma were screened for EGFR mutations. Mutation-positive patients were stratified by mutation type (exon 19 deletion, L858R, or other) and race (Asian or non-Asian) before two-to-one random assignment to 40 mg afatinib per day or up to six cycles of cisplatin plus pemetrexed chemotherapy at standard doses every 21 days. The primary end point was PFS by independent review. Secondary end points included tumor response, overall survival, adverse events, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). A total of 1,269 patients were screened, and 345 were randomly assigned to treatment. Median PFS was 11.1 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.78; P = .001). Median PFS among those with exon 19 deletions and L858R EGFR mutations (n = 308) was 13.6 months for afatinib and 6.9 months for chemotherapy (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.65; P = .001). The most common treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash/acne, and stomatitis for afatinib and nausea, fatigue, and decreased appetite for chemotherapy. PROs favored afatinib, with better control of cough, dyspnea, and pain. Afatinib is associated with prolongation of PFS when compared with standard doublet chemotherapy in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations.",cancer
170,IDH1 mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes are associated with an unfavorable prognosis.,"Myelodysplastic syndromes are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic stem cell disorders with a high propensity to transform into acute myeloid leukemia. Heterozygous missense mutations in IDH1 at position R132 and in IDH2 at positions R140 and R172 have recently been reported in acute myeloid leukemia. However, little is known about the incidence and prognostic impact of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes. We examined 193 patients with myelodysplastic syndromes and 53 patients with acute myeloid leukemia arising from myelodysplastic syndromes for mutations in IDH1 (R132), IDH2 (R172 and R140), and NPM1 by direct sequencing. We found that mutations in IDH1 occurred with a frequency of 3.6% in myelodysplastic syndromes (7 mutations in 193 patients) and 7.5% in acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (4 mutations in 53 patients). Three mutations in codon R140 of IDH2 and one mutation in codon R172 were found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia following myelodysplastic syndromes (7.5%). No IDH2 R140 or R172 mutations were identified in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. The presence of IDH1 mutations was associated with a shorter overall survival (HR 3.20; 95% CI 1.47-6.99) and a higher rate of transformation into acute myeloid leukemia (67% versus 28%, P=0.04). In multivariate analysis when considering karyotype, transfusion dependence and International Prognostic Scoring System score, IDH1 mutations remained an independent prognostic marker in myelodysplastic syndromes (HR 3.57; 95% CI 1.59-8.02; P=0.002). These results suggest that IDH1 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, and may become useful as a poor risk marker in these patients. These findings await validation in prospective trials.",cancer
118,KRAS mutation status is predictive of response to cetuximab therapy in colorectal cancer.,"The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (anti-EGFR) cetuximab has been proven to be efficient in metastatic colorectal cancer. The molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical response to this drug remain unknown. Genetic alterations of the intracellular effectors involved in EGFR-related signaling pathways may have an effect on response to this targeted therapy. In this study, tumors from 30 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated by cetuximab were screened for KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutation by direct sequencing and for EGFR copy number by chromogenic in situ hybridization. Eleven of the 30 patients (37%) responded to cetuximab. A KRAS mutation was found in 13 tumors (43%) and was significantly associated with the absence of response to cetuximab (KRAS mutation in 0% of the 11 responder patients versus 68.4% of the 19 nonresponder patients; P = 0.0003). The overall survival of patients without KRAS mutation in their tumor was significantly higher compared with those patients with a mutated tumor (P = 0.016; median, 16.3 versus 6.9 months). An increased EGFR copy number was found in 3 patients (10%) and was significantly associated with an objective tumor response to cetuximab (P = 0.04). In conclusion, in this study, KRAS mutations are a predictor of resistance to cetuximab therapy and are associated with a worse prognosis. The EGFR amplification, which is not as frequent as initially reported, is also associated with response to this treatment.",cancer
932,Loss of cohesin complex components STAG2 or STAG3 confers resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma.,"The protein kinase B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) is an oncogenic driver and therapeutic target in melanoma. Inhibitors of BRAF (BRAFi) have shown high response rates and extended survival in patients with melanoma who bear tumors that express mutations encoding BRAF proteins mutant at Val600, but a vast majority of these patients develop drug resistance. Here we show that loss of stromal antigen 2 (STAG2) or STAG3, which encode subunits of the cohesin complex, in melanoma cells results in resistance to BRAFi. We identified loss-of-function mutations in STAG2, as well as decreased expression of STAG2 or STAG3 proteins in several tumor samples from patients with acquired resistance to BRAFi and in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cell lines. Knockdown of STAG2 or STAG3 expression decreased sensitivity of BRAF(Val600Glu)-mutant melanoma cells and xenograft tumors to BRAFi. Loss of STAG2 inhibited CCCTC-binding-factor-mediated expression of dual specificity phosphatase 6 (DUSP6), leading to reactivation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling (via the MAPKs ERK1 and ERK2; hereafter referred to as ERK). Our studies unveil a previously unknown genetic mechanism of BRAFi resistance and provide new insights into the tumor suppressor function of STAG2 and STAG3.",cancer
2514,Comparison of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography and standard ultrasonography in liver cancer microwave ablation.,"Primary liver cancer has a high incidence and high mortality rates, and currently the only viable option is surgery, although there are a number of difficulties related to this method. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential advantages of the real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) for microwave ablation of primary liver cancer. One hundred patients with primary liver cancer were included in the study. The patients were divided into the ordinary ultrasonography and the CEUS groups. For the ordinary ultrasonography group, the ordinary ultrasonography-guided microwave ablation method was used, while microwave ablation under the guidance of CEUS was conducted for the CEUS group. The size of lesions and clearness of the tumor boundary prior to surgery in the two groups were compared. Additionally, postoperative complications and the survival rate were monitored. Lesion boundary areas measured by CEUS were significantly larger than those measured with ordinary ultrasonography. The incidence rate of postoperative pain, fever, intra-abdominal hemorrhage and infection and other complications in the ordinary ultrasonography group were significantly higher than that in the CEUS group. The tumor recurrence rate in the CEUS group was significantly lower than that in the ordinary ultrasonography group. Seventy-two percent of patients in the CEUS group showed no progress, compared to 48% of in the ordinary ultrasonography group. The progress-free survival rate in the CEUS group after 6 months was significantly higher than that in the ordinary ultrasonography group. Disease-free survival time in the CEUS group was considerably longer than the control group. In conclusion, the guidance of real-time CEUS on the primary liver cancer microwave ablation treatment can achieve good intra-operative results. It offers a real-time guidance effect, improves survival time and reduces the incidence of complications.",nonCancer
223,Integrated multimodal genetic testing of Ewing sarcoma--a single-institution experience.,"Ewing sarcoma (ES) is an aggressive malignant small round cell tumor that arises in bone or soft tissue of adolescents and young adults. A characteristic molecular finding in ES is EWSR1 gene fusion with ETS (erythroblast transformation-specific) family genes including FLI1 (~90%) and ERG (>5%). Here we report our experience using integrated clinicopathologic, cytogenetic, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analyses of 32 pediatric patients with ES diagnosed in a single institution between 2005 and 2011. Diagnostic EWSR1 rearrangements were detected in 30 (93.8%) of 32 patients. Cytogenetics detected t(11;22) (n = 14) and t(21;22) (n = 1) in 15 (46.9%) patients. FISH detected EWSR1 rearrangements in 27 (96.4%) of 28 patients tested. RT-PCR was positive in 27 (84.4%) of 32 patients, including 24 EWSR1-FLI1 and 3 EWSR1-ERG. RT-PCR defined breakpoints and fusion partners in 7 cases with EWSR1 rearrangements detected by FISH. Sanger sequencing further delineated breakpoints in 21 (77.8%) of 27 RT-PCR positive cases. In summary, conventional cytogenetic analysis provided a global view but had a lower detection rate and longer turnaround time than other methods. FISH is a rapid method and theoretically can detect all EWSR1 rearrangements, but it cannot identify all partners and is not completely specific for ES. RT-PCR and sequencing are more sensitive and useful in identifying fusion partners and refining breakpoints; however, these methods can be compromised by poor RNA preservation and primer design. In conclusion, an integrated approach that uses all methods capable of detecting EWSR1 rearrangements has value in the workup of suspected cases of ES.",cancer

Eighty SNPs in miRNA binding sites of cancer related genes selected from 18,500 miRNA:target bindings in crosslinking, ligation, and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) data were investigated in 379 advanced NSCLC patients using a sequenom mass spectrometry-based genotype assay. qRT-PCR and luciferase assay were conducted to examine functional relevance of potentially functional SNPs in miRNA binding sites. Of the 80 SNPs analyzed, 16 SNPs were significantly associated with the clinical outcomes after chemotherapy. Among these, ANAPC1 rs3814026C>T, ETS2 rs461155A>G, SORBS1 rs7081076C>A and POLR2A rs2071504C>T could predict both chemotherapy response and survival. Notably, ETS2 rs461155A>G was significantly associated with decreased ETS2 mRNA expression in both tumor and paired normal lung tissues (Ptrend = 4 × 10-7, and 3 × 10-4, respectively). Consistently, a decreased expression of the reporter gene for the G allele of rs461155 compared with the A allele was observed by luciferase assay. These findings suggest that the four SNPs, especially ETS2 rs461155A>G, could be used as biomarkers predicting the clinical outcomes of NSCLC patients treated with first-line paclitaxel-cisplatin chemotherapy.",cancer

We performed exome sequencing of eight aCMLs and identified somatic alterations of SETBP1 (encoding a p.Gly870Ser alteration) in two cases. Targeted resequencing of 70 aCMLs, 574 diverse hematological malignancies and 344 cancer cell lines identified SETBP1 mutations in 24 cases, including 17 of 70 aCMLs (24.3%; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 16-35%). Most mutations (92%) were located between codons 858 and 871 and were identical to changes seen in individuals with Schinzel-Giedion syndrome. Individuals with mutations had higher white blood cell counts (P = 0.008) and worse prognosis (P = 0.01). The p.Gly870Ser alteration abrogated a site for ubiquitination, and cells exogenously expressing this mutant exhibited higher amounts of SETBP1 and SET protein, lower PP2A activity and higher proliferation rates relative to those expressing the wild-type protein. In summary, mutated SETBP1 represents a newly discovered oncogene present in aCML and closely related diseases.",cancer

Cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) plays a key role in the process of metabolizing tamoxifen to its active moiety, endoxifen. Patients with variants of the CYP2D6 gene may not receive the full benefit of tamoxifen treatment. The CYP2D6*10 variant (the most common variant in Asians) was analyzed to optimize the prescription of tamoxifen in China. To ensure referring clinicians have accurate information for genotype-guided tamoxifen treatment, the Chinese National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL) organized a national proficiency testing (PT) to evaluate the performance of laboratories providing CYP2D6*10 genotyping. Ten genomic DNA samples with CYP2D6 wild-type or CYP2D6*10 variants were validated by PCR-sequencing and sent to 28 participant laboratories. The genotyping results and pharmacogenomic test reports were submitted and evaluated by NCCL experts. Additional information regarding the number of samples tested, the accreditation/certification status, and detecting technology was also requested. Thirty-one data sets were received, with a corresponding analytical sensitivity of 98.2% (548/558 challenges; 95% confidence interval: 96.7-99.1%) and an analytic specificity of 96.5% (675/682; 95% confidence interval: 97.9-99.5%). Overall, 25/28 participants correctly identified CYP2D6*10 status in 10 samples; however, two laboratories made serious genotyping errors. Most of the essential information was included in the 20 submitted CYP2D6*10 test reports. The majority of Chinese laboratories are reliable for detecting the CYP2D6*10 variant; however, several issues revealed in this study underline the importance of PT schemes in continued external assessment and provision of guidelines.",nonCancer
2123,Physiological aspects of Toll-like receptor 4 activation in sepsis-induced acute kidney injury.,"Sepsis-induced acute kidney injury (SI-AKI) is common and associated with high mortality. Survivors are at increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The precise mechanism underlying SI-AKI is unknown and no curative treatment exists. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activates the innate immune system in response to exogenous microbial products. The result is an inflammatory reaction aimed at clearing a potential infection. However, the consequence may also be organ dysfunction as the immune response can cause collateral damage to host tissue. The purpose of this review is to describe the basis for how ligand binding to TLR4 has the potential to cause renal dysfunction and the mechanisms by which this may take place in gram-negative sepsis. In addition, we highlight areas for future research that can further our knowledge of the pathogenesis of SI-AKI in relation to TLR4 activation. TLR4 is expressed in the kidney. Activation of TLR4 causes cytokine and chemokine release as well as renal leukocyte infiltration. It also results in endothelial and tubular dysfunction in addition to altered renal metabolism and circulation. From a physiological standpoint inhibiting TLR4 in large-animal experimental SI-AKI significantly improves renal function. Thus, current evidence indicates that TLR4 has the ability to mediate SI-AKI by a number of mechanisms. The strong experimental evidence supporting a role of TLR4 in the pathogenesis of SI-AKI in combination with the availability of pharmacological tools to target TLR4 warrants future human studies.

Some DFSP progress to a higher-grade fibrosarcomatous form, with rapid growth and increased risk of metastasis. Imatinib provides clinical benefit in approximately 50% of patients with unresectable or metastatic DFSP. However, efficacious medical therapies have not been developed for imatinib-resistant DFSP. We established a model of imatinib-resistant DFSP and evaluated CDK4/6 inhibition as a genomically credentialed targeted therapy. DFSP105, an imatinib-resistant human cell line, was established from a fibrosarcomatous DFSP (FS-DFSP), and was studied by SNP arrays and sequencing to identify targetable genomic alterations. Findings were validated in vitro and in vivo, and confirmed in a series including 12 DFSP and 6 FS-DFSP. SNP analysis of DFSP105 revealed a homozygous deletion encompassing CDKN2A and CDKN2B. The resultant p16 loss implicated CDK4/6 as a potential therapeutic target in DFSP. We further demonstrated CDKN2A homozygous deletion in 1 of 12 conventional DFSP and 2 of 6 FS-DFSP, whereas p16 expression was lost in 4 of 18 DFSP. In vitro treatment of DFSP105 with two structurally distinct selective CDK4/6 inhibitors, PD-0332991 and LEE011, led to inhibition of RB1 phosphorylation and inhibition of proliferation (GI50 160 nmol/L and 276 nmol/L, respectively). In vivo treatment of DFSP105 with PD-0332991 (150 mg/kg) inhibited xenograft growth in mice, in comparison with imatinib-treated or -untreated tumors. In conclusion, CDKN2A deletion can contribute to DFSP progression. CDK4/6 inhibition is a preclinically effective treatment against p16-negative, imatinib-resistant FS-DFSP, and should be evaluated as a therapeutic strategy in patients with unresectable or metastatic imatinib-resistant DFSP.",cancer
189,Somatic mutations of the histone methyltransferase gene EZH2 in myelodysplastic syndromes.,"In myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), deletions of chromosome 7 or 7q are common and correlate with a poor prognosis. The relevant genes on chromosome 7 are unknown. We report here that EZH2, located at 7q36.1, is frequently targeted in MDS. Analysis of EZH2 deletions, missense and frameshift mutations strongly suggests that EZH2 is a tumor suppressor. As EZH2 functions as a histone methyltransferase, abnormal histone modification may contribute to epigenetic deregulation in MDS.",cancer
571,Single nucleotide polymorphism in the microRNA-199a binding site of HIF1A gene is associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma risk and worse clinical outcomes.,"Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1α) is over-expressed in many cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and correlated with poor prognosis. We aim to determine the effect of germline genetic variants on the regulation of the homeostasis of the miRNA-gene regulatory loop in HIF1A gene and PDAC risk. HIF1A rs2057482 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was genotyped in 410 PDAC cases and 490 healthy controls. The CC genotype SNP HIF1A is significantly correlated with PDAC risk (OR = 1.719, 95% CI: 1.293-2.286) and shorter overall survival (OS, P<0.0001) compared with the CT/TT alleles group. The C/T variants of rs2057482, a SNP located near the miR-199a binding site in HIF1A, could lead to differential regulation of HIF1A by miR-199a. Specifically, the C allele of rs2057482 weakened miR-199a-induced repression of HIF-1α expression on both mRNA and protein levels. In the PDAC tissue, individuals with the rs2057482-CC genotype expressed significantly higher levels of HIF-1α protein than those with the rs2057482-CT/TT genotype (P<0.0001). Both the CC genotype of SNP HIF1A and increased HIF-1α expression are significantly associated with shorter OS of patients with PDAC. After adjusted by TNM staging, differentiation grade, and the levels of CA19-9, both SNP HIF1A and HIF-1α expression retained highly significance on OS (P<0.0001). Taken together, our study demonstrates that host genetic variants could disturb the regulation of the miR-199a/HIF1A regulatory loop and alter PDAC risk and poor prognosis. In conclusion, the rs2057482-CC genotype increases the susceptibility to PDAC and associated with cancer progression.",cancer
2376,Association between OPN genetic variations and nephrolithiasis risk.,"Osteopontin (OPN) has an important role in urolithiasis. However, few studies have explored the association between OPN genetic variants and urolithiasis risk. In the present study, three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs28357094, rs11439060 and rs11730582) located on the promoter of OPN were genotyped in a total of 480 individuals, including 230 nephrolithiasis patients and 250 matched healthy controls, and the associations between these SNPs and nephrolithiasis risk in different genetic models was assessed. No significant differences were identified in the genotype and allele frequencies of OPN rs28357094 or rs11730582 (P=0.805 for rs28357094; P=0.577 for rs11730582, respectively). However, carriers with the OPN rs11439060 insertion (ins) types (ins/deletion and ins/ins) were overrepresented in urolithiasis patients compared with the controls [odds ratio (OR), 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.08-2.22]. In the stratified analysis, the increased risk was more evident among younger subjects (adjusted OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.01-2.81), females (2.15; 1.14-4.08), overweight subjects (1.80; 1.07-3.05), normotensive subjects (2.48; 1.02-6.00), abnormal blood sugar subjects (1.58; 1.08-2.30), smokers (1.63; 1.02-2.60), and ever-drinkers (1.98; 1.10-3.60).. These findings revealed that the OPN rs11439060 polymorphism may act as genetic biomarker for the detection of high-risk nephrolithiasis patients.",nonCancer
2222,Antimicrobial Activity of Peganum Harmala L. on Streptococcus mutans Compared to 0.2% Chlorhexidine.,"Dental caries is one the most prevalent diseases that affects humans throughout their lives. Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans) is recognized as the most important microorganism during tooth cariogenicity. Reducing this germ in oral cavity can reduce the rate of tooth decays in humans.|The present study compared the antimicrobial activity of ethanolic extract of Peganum harmala L. seeds and 0.2% chlorhexidine on S. mutans.|Agar diffusion technique and micro broth dilution method were employed to test the antimicrobial effects of these two agents on S. mutans. Moreover, the cytotoxicity of ethanolic extract of P. harmala was studied on Vero cells by MTT (thiazolyl blue tetrazolium dye) colorimetric method. The data were analyzed with descriptive methods.|Concentrations of 50, 25, and 12.5 mg/mL of the extract made inhibition zones of bacterial growth around the wells; but, lower concentrations could not inhibit the growth of S. mutans. Besides, the antimicrobial effect of 0.2% chlorhexidine was more than 50 mg/mL of the extract. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the extract on S. mutans was 1.83±0.6 mg/mL and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was 4.3±1 mg/mL. The MIC and MBC for 0.2% chlorhexidine were reported to be 0.19 mg/mL, and 0.78 mg/mL, respectively. The extract concentrations more than 0.5 mg/mL were toxic and caused more than 50% Vero cell death.|Despite the remarkable antimicrobial effects of high concentrations of P. harmala on S. mutans, high cell toxicity of this plant would restrict its in vivo therapeutic use.",nonCancer
153,Loss of PTEN is not associated with poor survival in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients of the temozolomide era.,"Pre-temozolomide studies demonstrated that loss of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN held independent prognostic significance in GBM patients. We investigated whether loss of PTEN predicted shorter survival in the temozolomide era. The role of PTEN in the PI3K/Akt pathway is also reviewed. Patients with histologically proven newly diagnosed GBM were identified from a retrospective database between 2007 and 2010. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to calculate the independent effects of PTEN expression, age, extent of resection, Karnofsky performance scale (KPS), and treatment on overall survival. Sixty-five percent of patients were men with median age of 63 years, and 70% had KPS≥80. Most patients (81%) received standard treatment (temozolomide with concurrent radiation). A total of 72 (47%) patients had retained PTEN expression. Median overall survival (OS) was 19.1 months (95% CI: 15.0-22.5). Median survival of 20.0 months (95% CI: 15.0-25.5) and 18.2 months (95% CI: 13.0-25.7) was observed in PTEN retained and PTEN loss patients, respectively (p = .71). PTEN loss patients were also found to have amplifications of EGFR gene more frequently than patients with retained PTEN (70.8% vs. 47.8%, p = .01). Multivariate analysis showed that older age (HR 1.64, CI: 1.02-2.63, p = .04), low KPS (HR 3.57, CI: 2.20-5.79, p<.0001), and lack of standard treatment (HR 3.98, CI: 2.38-6.65, p<.0001) yielded worse survival. PTEN loss was not prognostic of overall survival (HR 1.31, CI: 0.85-2.03, p = .22). Loss of expression of PTEN does not confer poor overall survival in the temozolomide era. These findings imply a complex and non-linear molecular relationship between PTEN, its regulators and effectors in the tumorigenesis of glioblastoma. Additionally, there is evidence that temozolomide may be more effective in eradicating GBM cancer cells with PTEN loss and hence, level the outcomes between the PTEN retained and loss groups.",cancer
329,Tumors with AKT1E17K Mutations Are Rational Targets for Single Agent or Combination Therapy with AKT Inhibitors.,"AKT1(E17K) mutations occur at low frequency in a variety of solid tumors, including those of the breast and urinary bladder. Although this mutation has been shown to transform rodent cells in culture, it was found to be less oncogenic than PIK3CA mutations in breast epithelial cells. Moreover, the therapeutic potential of AKT inhibitors in human tumors with an endogenous AKT1(E17K) mutation is not known. Expression of exogenous copies of AKT1(E17K) in MCF10A breast epithelial cells increased phosphorylation of AKT and its substrates, induced colony formation in soft agar, and formation of lesions in the mammary fat pad of immunodeficient mice. These effects were inhibited by the allosteric and catalytic AKT inhibitors MK-2206 and AZD5363, respectively. Both AKT inhibitors caused highly significant growth inhibition of breast cancer explant models with AKT1(E17K) mutation. Furthermore, in a phase I clinical study, the catalytic Akt inhibitor AZD5363 induced partial responses in patients with breast and ovarian cancer with tumors containing AKT1(E17K) mutations. In MGH-U3 bladder cancer xenografts, which contain both AKT1(E17K) and FGFR3(Y373C) mutations, AZD5363 monotherapy did not significantly reduce tumor growth, but tumor regression was observed in combination with the FGFR inhibitor AZD4547. The data show that tumors with AKT1(E17K) mutations are rational therapeutic targets for AKT inhibitors, although combinations with other targeted agents may be required where activating oncogenic mutations of other proteins are present in the same tumor.",cancer
2097,Modeling anti-IL-6 therapy using breast cancer patient-derived xenografts.,"The pleiotropic cytokine IL-6 accelerates the progression of breast cancer in a variety of preclinical models through the activation of the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) signaling pathway. However, the proportion of breast cancers sensitive to anti-IL-6 therapies is not known. This study evaluates the efficacy of anti-IL-6 therapies using breast cancer patient derived xenografts (PDXs). During the generation of our collection of PDXs, we showed that the successful engraftment of tumor tissue in immunodeficient mice correlates with bad prognosis. Four PDXs out of six were resistant to anti-IL-6 therapies and the expression of IL-6, its receptor or the levels of phospho-STAT3 (the active form of the signal transducer) did not correlate with sensitivity. Using cell cultures established from the PDXs as well as samples from in vivo treatments, we showed that only tumors in which the activation of STAT3 depends on IL-6 respond to the blocking antibodies. Our results indicate that only a fraction of breast tumors are responsive to anti-IL-6 therapies. In order to identify responsive tumors, a functional assay to determine the dependence of STAT3 activation on IL-6 should be performed.",nonCancer

In the adefovir (ADV) group, six patients receiving combined therapy were DNA-positive after more than 3 years of therapy. Ultra-deep pyrosequencing was used to analyze the dynamics of multi-drugs resistance mutations.|At baseline, all 46 treatment-naïve patients harbored rtA181V/T substitutions (1.2%-4.6%) and rtN236T substitutions (1.6%-6.1%). In the ADV group, eight patients with long-term treatment were consecutively HBV DNA-positive for more than 3 years. During treatment, the rtA181T resistance-associated site appeared with increasing frequency in six of eight patients (NOs. 1-6), and two patients (NOs.4 and 8) carrying the rtA181T resistance mutations increasingly showed high levels of rtN236T. One patient (NO. 8) experienced virological breakthrough. Other known pre-existing mutations showed no dynamic fluctuations, including in rtA194T, rtP177G, rtF249A, and rtD263E. In addition to the common substitutions, some previously unknown amino acid substitutions, such as rtD134N, rtL145M/S, rtF151Y/L, rtR153Q, and rtS223A, should be further studied.|HBV-resistance substitutions conferring to nucleoside analogs are present at baseline.

1716,Differences in virologic and immunologic response to antiretroviral therapy among HIV-1 infected infants and children.,"Virologic and immunologic responses to antiretroviral treatment (ART) in infants may differ from older children due to immunologic, clinical or epidemiologic characteristics.|Longitudinal ART responses were modeled and compared in HIV-infected infants and children enrolled in cohorts in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants were enrolled soon after HIV diagnosis, started on ART, and followed for two years. Viral load decline was compared between infant and child cohorts using a nonlinear mixed effects model and CD4% reconstitution using a linear mixed effects model.|Among 121 infants, median age at ART was 3.9 months; among 124 children, median age was 4.8 years. At baseline, viral load (VL) was higher among infant than children (6.47 vs. 5.91 log10 copies/ml, P < 0.001). Infants were less likely than children to suppress viral load to <250 copies/ml following 6 months of ART (32% infants vs. 73% children P < 0.0001). CD4% was higher at baseline in infants than children (19% vs. 7.3%, P < 0.001). Older children had more rapid CD4% reconstitution than infants, but failed to catch up to infant CD4%.|Despite substantially higher CD4% at ART initiation, viral suppression was significantly slower among infants than older children.

1243,Characteristics of lung cancers harboring NRAS mutations.,"We sought to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of patients with lung cancer harboring NRAS mutations. We used preclinical models to identify targeted therapies likely to be of benefit against NRAS-mutant lung cancer cells. We reviewed clinical data from patients whose lung cancers were identified at six institutions or reported in the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC) to harbor NRAS mutations. Six NRAS-mutant cell lines were screened for sensitivity against inhibitors of multiple kinases (i.e., EGFR, ALK, MET, IGF-1R, BRAF, PI3K, and MEK). Among 4,562 patients with lung cancers tested, NRAS mutations were present in 30 (0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.94%); 28 of these had no other driver mutations. 83% had adenocarcinoma histology with no significant differences in gender. While 95% of patients were former or current smokers, smoking-related G:C>T:A transversions were significantly less frequent in NRAS-mutated lung tumors than KRAS-mutant non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC; NRAS: 13% (4/30), KRAS: 66% (1772/2733), P < 0.00000001]. Five of 6 NRAS-mutant cell lines were sensitive to the MEK inhibitors, selumetinib and trametinib, but not to other inhibitors tested. NRAS mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Although NRAS mutations are more common in current/former smokers, the types of mutations are not those classically associated with smoking.",cancer
599,"Pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.","In patients with metastatic breast cancer that is positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), progression-free survival was significantly improved after first-line therapy with pertuzumab, trastuzumab, and docetaxel, as compared with placebo, trastuzumab, and docetaxel. Overall survival was significantly improved with pertuzumab in an interim analysis without the median being reached. We report final prespecified overall survival results with a median follow-up of 50 months. We randomly assigned patients with metastatic breast cancer who had not received previous chemotherapy or anti-HER2 therapy for their metastatic disease to receive the pertuzumab combination or the placebo combination. The secondary end points of overall survival, investigator-assessed progression-free survival, independently assessed duration of response, and safety are reported. Sensitivity analyses were adjusted for patients who crossed over from placebo to pertuzumab after the interim analysis. The median overall survival was 56.5 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.3 to not reached) in the group receiving the pertuzumab combination, as compared with 40.8 months (95% CI, 35.8 to 48.3) in the group receiving the placebo combination (hazard ratio favoring the pertuzumab group, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; P<0.001), a difference of 15.7 months. This analysis was not adjusted for crossover to the pertuzumab group and is therefore conservative. Results of sensitivity analyses after adjustment for crossover were consistent. Median progression-free survival as assessed by investigators improved by 6.3 months in the pertuzumab group (hazard ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58 to 0.80). Pertuzumab extended the median duration of response by 7.7 months, as independently assessed. Most adverse events occurred during the administration of docetaxel in the two groups, with long-term cardiac safety maintained. In patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the addition of pertuzumab to trastuzumab and docetaxel, as compared with the addition of placebo, significantly improved the median overall survival to 56.5 months and extended the results of previous analyses showing the efficacy of this drug combination.

1265,Induction of p53-dependent senescence by the MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3a in mouse cells of fibroblast origin.,"Cellular senescence is emerging as an important in vivo anticancer response elicited by multiple stresses, including currently used chemotherapeutic drugs. Nutlin-3a is a recently discovered small-molecule antagonist of the p53-destabilizing protein murine double minute-2 (MDM2) that induces cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells with functional p53. Here, we report that nutlin-3a induces cellular senescence in murine primary fibroblasts, oncogenically transformed fibroblasts, and fibrosarcoma cell lines. No evidence of drug-induced apoptosis was observed in any case. Nutlin-induced senescence was strictly dependent on the presence of functional p53 as revealed by the fact that cells lacking p53 were completely insensitive to the drug, whereas cells lacking the tumor suppressor alternative reading frame product of the CDKN2A locus underwent irreversible cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, irreversibility was achieved in neoplastic cells faster than in their corresponding parental primary cells, suggesting that nutlin-3a and oncogenic signaling cooperate in activating p53. Our current results suggest that senescence could be a major cellular outcome of cancer therapy by antagonists of the p53-MDM2 interaction, such as nutlin-3a.",cancer
263,IKZF1 (Ikaros) deletions in BCR-ABL1-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia are associated with short disease-free survival and high rate of cumulative incidence of relapse: a GIMEMA AL WP report.,"The causes of the aggressive nature of BCR-ABL1-positive adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are unknown. To identify, at the submicroscopic level, oncogenic lesions that cooperate with BCR-ABL1 to induce ALL, we performed an investigation of genomic copy number alterations using single nucleotide polymorphism array, genomic polymerase chain reaction, and sequencing of candidate genes. Eighty-three patients with de novo adult Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) -positive ALL were enrolled onto institutional (n = 17) or Gruppo Italiano Malattie Ematologiche Maligne dell'Adulto Working Party delle Leucemia Acute (n = 66) clinical trials. Treatments included tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) alone, conventional chemotherapy, or a combination of TKI and chemotherapy. A 7p12 deletion of IKZF1 (Ikaros) was identified in 52 (63%) of 83 patients. The pattern of deletion varied among different patients, but the two most common deletion types were loss of exons 4 to 7 in 31 (37%) of 83 patients and loss of exons 2 to 7 in 17 (20%) of 83 patients. Disease-free survival (DFS) was shorter in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10 v 32 months, respectively; P = .02). Furthermore, a significantly shorter cumulative incidence of relapse was recorded in patients with IKZF1 deletion versus patients with IKZF1 wild type (10.1 v 56.1 months, respectively; P = .001). Multivariate analysis confirmed the negative prognostic impact of IKZF1 deletion on DFS (P = .04). We conclude that IKZF1 deletions are likely to be a genomic alteration that significantly affects the prognosis of Ph-positive ALL in adults.",cancer
2042,Criticality and Adaptivity in Enzymatic Networks.,"The contrast between the stochasticity of biochemical networks and the regularity of cellular behavior suggests that biological networks generate robust behavior from noisy constituents. Identifying the mechanisms that confer this ability on biological networks is essential to understanding cells. Here we show that queueing for a limited shared resource in broad classes of enzymatic networks in certain conditions leads to a critical state characterized by strong and long-ranged correlations between molecular species. An enzymatic network reaches this critical state when the input flux of its substrate is balanced by the maximum processing capacity of the network. We then consider enzymatic networks with adaptation, when the limiting resource (enzyme or cofactor) is produced in proportion to the demand for it. We show that the critical state becomes an attractor for these networks, which points toward the onset of self-organized criticality. We suggest that the adaptive queueing motif that leads to significant correlations between multiple species may be widespread in biological systems.",nonCancer
576,FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication tyrosine kinase inhibitors display a nonoverlapping profile of resistance mutations in vitro.,"FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors have shown activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Secondary mutations in target kinases can cause clinical resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition. We have previously shown that sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating FLT3 mutations. We therefore intended to determine whether different FLT3 inhibitors would produce distinct profiles of secondary, FLT3 resistance mutations. Using a cell-based screening approach, we generated FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-expressing cell lines resistant to the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614, PKC412, and sorafenib. Interestingly, the profile of resistance mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain (TK2) with exchanges of D835 predominating. In contrast, PKC412 exclusively produced mutations within tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) at position N676. A mutation at N676 recently has been reported in a case of PKC412-resistant AML. TK1 mutations exhibited a differential response to SU5614, sorafenib, and sunitinib but strongly impaired response to PKC412. TK2 exchanges identified with SU5614 were sensitive to PKC412, sunitinib, or sorafenib, with the exception of Y842D, which caused a strong resistance to sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib also produced a highly distinct profile of resistance mutations with no overlap to SU5614 or PKC412, including F691L in TK1 and exchanges at position Y842 of TK2. Thus, different FLT3 kinase inhibitors generate distinct, nonoverlapping resistance profiles. This is in contrast to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which display overlapping resistance profiles. Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to prevent FLT3 resistance mutations in the setting of FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",cancer
553,Optimal adjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer in 2015.,"The introduction of trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer changed the natural course of early-stage disease. Currently, one year of trastuzumab given concurrently with a taxane and following an anthracycline regimen is the preferred standard of care in Europe. The first attempt to escalate this approach, though the implementation of dual HER2 blockade with lapatinib added to trastuzumab, as assessed by the ALTTO trial, failed to improve further clinical outcomes; clinical assessment of the adjuvant trastuzumab/pertuzumab regimen is still ongoing in the APHINITY trial. Negative results were also reported for the addition of bevacizumab to adjuvant trastuzumab treatment within the context of the BETH study. Similarly, efforts to de-escalate through shortening the duration of adjuvant trastuzumab treatment failed (the PHARE trial), whereas others are still ongoing. Of note, evidence supports the use of lighter chemotherapy regimens with one year of adjuvant trastuzumab as backbone, for women with small HER2-positive breast tumors, where the omission of anthracyclines did not compromise the clinical outcome. Despite the successes achieved so far, a proportion of women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, will still experience disease recurrence. The identification of these women is urgently needed, as well as the identification of predictive biomarkers to dictate the optimal treatment strategy. So far, HER2 expression status has been the only validated predictive biomarker for this patient population. Despite the clear association of pCR achieved through neoadjuvant trastuzumab-based chemotherapy with clinical outcome, results from neoadjuvant trials have not been always consistent with what was seen in the adjuvant setting. Similarly, inconsistent results have been reported for the predictive ability of alterations affecting the PI3K signaling pathway or the quantification of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes. In the era of personalized oncology, rigorous translational and clinical collaborative efforts are needed to further advance the field of treatment of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.",cancer
144,Potential application of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations as prognostic indicators in non-promyelocytic acute myeloid leukemia: a meta-analysis.,"Recurrent mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase isoforms 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) have recently been studied in adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A meta-analysis was performed to demonstrate their controversial prognostic impacts. The associations of IDH1 or IDH2 mutations with other molecular abnormalities were also investigated. In patients with AML, IDH1/2 mutations were significantly associated with normal karyotype and isolated trisomy 8 (p < .05). After adjusting for well-studied prognostic factors, IDH1 mutation seems to be associated with subtle but significantly inferior event-free survival (EFS) (p = 0.02) and possible adverse overall survival (OS) (p = 0.13) in patients with AML, especially in the favorable genotype subset with mutated NPM1 but without FLT3-ITD mutation (p < 0.05). Longer OS (p = 0.01) and better EFS tendency (p = 0.18) are implicated in patients with IDH2 mutations, which suggests that IDH2 mutations appear to confer a favorable prognosis. Moreover, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may play a more important role in abnormal cytogenetics subgroups such as isolated trisomy 8. Screening of IDH1/2 mutations could help to identify patients at high risk within some subsets of AML.",cancer
18,Frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations are different in histological types and sites of origin of cutaneous melanoma: a meta-analysis.,"There have been conflicting data regarding the prevalence and clinicopathological characteristics of BRAF and NRAS mutations in primary cutaneous melanoma. To solve this controversy, this study used a meta-analysis to evaluate the frequencies of BRAF and NRAS mutations, and the relationship between these mutations and clinicopathological parameters of cutaneous melanoma. Data from studies published between 1989 and 2010 were combined. The BRAF and NRAS mutations were reported in 36 and 31 studies involving 2521 and 1972 patients, respectively. The effect sizes of outcome parameters were calculated by odds ratios (OR). BRAF and NRAS mutations were reported in 41% and 18% of cutaneous melanomas, respectively. The mutations were associated with histological subtype and tumour site, but not with age and sex. The BRAF mutation was frequently detected in patients with superficial spreading melanoma (OR=2·021; P<0·001) and in melanomas arising in nonchronic sun-damaged skin (OR=2·043; P=0·001). In contrast, the NRAS mutation was frequently evident in patients with nodular melanoma (OR=1·894; P<0·001) and in melanomas arising in chronic sun-damaged skin (OR=1·887; P=0·018). This pooled analysis shows that the incidences of BRAF and NRAS mutations in cutaneous melanomas differ according to histological type and tumour location based on the degree of sun exposure.",cancer

1312,"Novel cis-[(NHC)(1)(NHC)(2)(L)Cl]platinum(ii) complexes - synthesis, structures, and anticancer activities.","A general synthesis of novel platinum(ii) complexes bearing two different, cis-oriented, N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands is presented. Easily accessible cis-[Pt(II)(NHC)(DMSO)] precursor complexes were converted to either cis-[Pt(II)(NHC)2Cl2] complexes such as 5a and 5b, or to novel mixed cis-[Pt(II)(NHC)(1)(NHC)(2)Cl2] complexes such as 5c-h by successive introduction of the individual carbene ligands. The 'symmetric' complexes 5a and 5b were also converted to cationic cis-[Pt(II)(NHC)2(PPh3)Cl](+)Cl(-) complexes 8a and 8b. The structures of the ten new complexes, comprising benzylated and alkylated imidazol-2-ylidene ligands, were analysed by (1)H, (13)C and (195)Pt NMR spectroscopy and also by X-ray diffraction for 5a, 5d, 5h, and 8a. The neutral complexes 5 were cytotoxic against a panel of seven human cancer cell lines with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, while the cationic complexes 8 reached even nanomolar IC50 values. Complex 5h carrying the substitution pattern of the natural antitumoral agent Combretastatin A-4 showed a conspicuous specificity for cancer cell lines sensitive to this drug. In electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the cis-biscarbene complexes 5b and 8b led to an unwinding or aggregation of plasmid DNA, while the trans-biscarbene complex 1b showed no such effect.",nonCancer
607,Trastuzumab treatment in patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma overexpressing HER2/neu.,"To study the effect of trastuzumab in patients with progressive or recurrent metastatic endometrial carcinoma shown by immunohistochemistry to overexpress the HER2/neu receptor. Disease progression was examined in 2 patients who met the study criteria, had c-erbB2 gene amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization, and were treated with trastuzumab following radiation treatment and/or salvage chemotherapy. The clinical responses to trastuzumab as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy were confirmed in both patients by serial CT scans and serum CA-125 evaluations. These patients with progressive or recurrent metastatic disease experienced relief from their symptoms and prolonged survival with no significant toxicity observed. Trastuzumab may be a viable therapeutic option as single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in patients with advanced, recurrent, and/or metastatic endometrial carcinomas overexpressing HER2/neu.",cancer
2145,Induced Hypothermia in Neurocritical Care: A Review.,"Induced hypothermia (IH) continues to become a more prevalent treatment modality in neurocritical care. Reducing core temperature has been shown to protect brain tissue during injury and disease. IH has been particularly beneficial in the medical management of refractory intracranial hypertension and malignant cerebral edema. These pathologies are often the result of diffuse cerebral edema after traumatic brain injury, malignant ischemic stroke, or intracerebral hemorrhage. Although there are many benefits to IH, it is not without complications. Chief among these is shivering, which decreases oxygen delivery to brain tissue, increases metabolic demands, and consequently reduces nutrient delivery. This article will review indications for IH administration, methods of providing IH, nursing responsibilities, and identifying and/or managing complications.",nonCancer
468,Insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) as a biomarker for resistance to the tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib in non-small cell lung cancer.,"The insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) pathway is known to play a role in the acquisition of resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, its exact role in TKI resistance has so far remained unclear. Here, we interrogated the hypothesis that the IGF-1R may serve as a biomarker for, and may play a role in, intrinsic resistance to the EGFR-specific TKI gefitinib in NSCLC. Total-IGF-1R and phosphorylated (p)-IGF-1R expression levels were related to gefitinib sensitivity in 23 NSCLC cell lines. This sensitivity was re-evaluated after knocking down IGF-1R expression and after IGF-1R up-regulation through exogenous IGF-1 expression. The utility of IGF-1R expression as a predictive biomarker was also evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 98 primary NSCLC samples from patients treated with gefitinib. Seventeen of the cell lines tested were resistant to gefitinib, whereas 3 cell lines were sensitive. The three remaining cell lines showed intermediate values. Thirteen resistant cell lines were found to be positive for total-IGF-1R expression, while all the sensitive cell lines were negative, resulting in a positive predictive value (PPV) of 81% for total-IGF-1R to predict resistance. Seven resistant cell lines exhibited high p-IGF-1R levels, whereas all 3 sensitive cell lines were negative for p-IGF-1R, resulting in a PPV of 100% for p-IGF-1R to predict resistance. Neither a knock-down of IGF-1R expression nor an activation of the IGF1-R pathway through exogenous IGF-1 expression affected gefitinib sensitivity. In primary NSCLC tissues, IGF-1R expression was found to be significantly higher in patients with progressive disease, i.e., showing gefitinib resistance, as compared to those with a complete or partial response. IGF-1R acts as a predictor for resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC cell lines and NSCLC patients, but does not seem to play a role in the intrinsic resistance to this drug. High total-IGF-1R and p-IGR-1R levels may predict such a resistance. Since the underlying mechanism does not appear to be related to proliferation induction, alternative pathways should be explored.",cancer
772,Loss of CDKN2A expression is a frequent event in primary invasive melanoma and correlates with sensitivity to the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991 in melanoma cell lines.,"We have investigated the potential for the p16-cyclin D-CDK4/6-retinoblastoma protein pathway to be exploited as a therapeutic target in melanoma. In a cohort of 143 patients with primary invasive melanoma, we used fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect gene copy number variations (CNVs) in CDK4, CCND1, and CDKN2A and immunohistochemistry to determine protein expression. CNVs were common in melanoma, with gain of CDK4 or CCND1 in 37 and 18% of cases, respectively, and hemizygous or homozygous loss of CDKN2A in 56%. Three-quarters of all patients demonstrated a CNV in at least one of the three genes. The combination of CCND1 gain with either a gain of CDK4 and/or loss of CDKN2A was associated with poorer melanoma-specific survival. In 47 melanoma cell lines homozygous loss, methylation or mutation of CDKN2A gene or loss of protein (p16(INK) (4A) ) predicted sensitivity to the CDK4/6 inhibitor PD0332991, while RB1 loss predicted resistance.",cancer
1789,The Impact of Interpersonal and Noninterpersonal Trauma on Psychological Symptoms in Refugees: The Moderating Role of Gender and Trauma Type.,"Research findings have documented a relationship between the number of types of traumatic events to which refugees were exposed and psychological disorders. It is unclear, however, if gender moderates the impact of trauma on refugee mental health. The participants in this study were 60 male and 31 female refugees and asylum-seekers resettled in Australia. Participants had a mean age of 34.54 years (SD = 9.70), and were from a variety of countries including Iraq, Iran, and Sri Lanka. We conducted a multigroup path analysis to test if the relationship between psychological outcomes of exposure to trauma (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] symptoms, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression) was different as a function of the type of traumatic exposure (interpersonal vs. noninterpersonal) or as a function of gender. We found a significant relationship between interpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (β = .77) and anxiety symptoms (β = .32) in women, and a significant association between noninterpersonal trauma exposure and PTSD symptoms (β = .59), anxiety (β =.49), and depression symptoms (β = .32) in men. For men, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = 0.14 to 1.01; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = -0.53 to 0.43. For women, the effect sizes of the relationship between exposure to specific types of noninterpersonal trauma and psychological symptoms ranged from d = -0.79 to 0.67; for exposure to interpersonal trauma, they ranged from d = -0.09 to 1.46. These results suggested supporting refugees in their efforts to overcome the psychological impact of trauma, including the allocation of resources in clinical services to support the psychological recovery of refugees.",nonCancer
2322,Isolation of an antimicrobial compound produced by bacteria associated with reef-building corals.,"Bacterial communities associated with healthy corals produce antimicrobial compounds that inhibit the colonization and growth of invasive microbes and potential pathogens. To date, however, bacteria-derived antimicrobial molecules have not been identified in reef-building corals. Here, we report the isolation of an antimicrobial compound produced by Pseudovibrio sp. P12, a common and abundant coral-associated bacterium. This strain was capable of metabolizing dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP), a sulfur molecule produced in high concentrations by reef-building corals and playing a role in structuring their bacterial communities. Bioassay-guided fractionation coupled with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectrometry (MS), identified the antimicrobial as tropodithietic acid (TDA), a sulfur-containing compound likely derived from DMSP catabolism. TDA was produced in large quantities by Pseudovibrio sp., and prevented the growth of two previously identified coral pathogens, Vibrio coralliilyticus and V. owensii, at very low concentrations (0.5 μg/mL) in agar diffusion assays. Genome sequencing of Pseudovibrio sp. P12 identified gene homologs likely involved in the metabolism of DMSP and production of TDA. These results provide additional evidence for the integral role of DMSP in structuring coral-associated bacterial communities and underline the potential of these DMSP-metabolizing microbes to contribute to coral disease prevention.",nonCancer
695,PACMEL: a phase 1 dose escalation trial of trametinib (GSK1120212) in combination with paclitaxel.,"We sought to determine the maximal tolerated dose of the MEK inhibitor trametinib with weekly paclitaxel, with a view to exploring the combination's activity in melanoma lacking a BRAF V600 mutation. In this phase 1 study we used a fixed dose of paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 intravenous (IV) on days 1, 8 and 15 of each 4 week cycle) and escalated the dose of trametinib (to a maximum 2mg orally (PO) daily), following a 3+3 design. Eligible patients had advanced melanoma and could have received up to two previous lines of treatment for metastatic disease. 15 patients were enrolled, all but one of whose melanoma was wild type for BRAF at codon 600. The maximal monotherapy dose of trametinib proved tolerable with weekly paclitaxel. The most frequent adverse events observed were rash and fatigue. Six (40%) partial responses were reported, including four of eight patients with NRAS mutations. Median progression free survival was 5.5 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-7.8 months) and overall survival, 14.1 months (95% CI 4.6-not reached). Trametinib can safely be given with weekly paclitaxel at the full monotherapy dose. In this small group promising progression free and overall survival were observed in patients with melanoma lacking a V600 BRAF mutation.",cancer
1191,K-ras oncogene activation as a prognostic marker in adenocarcinoma of the lung.,"The capability of activated oncogenes to induce malignant transformation of immortalized cells in vitro has suggested that they have a similar role in the pathogenesis of human tumors. We previously found that activation of the K-ras oncogene by a point mutation in codon 12 occurs in about one third of human lung adenocarcinomas. We studied the clinical importance of this oncogene-activation in 69 patients with lung adenocarcinoma in whom complete resection of the tumor was possible. The polymerase chain reaction was used to amplify ras-specific sequences of DNA isolated from frozen or paraffin-embedded tumor samples. Ras point mutations were subsequently detected and classified with the use of mutation-specific oligonucleotide probes. Nineteen of the tumors harbored a point mutation in codon 12 of the K-ras oncogene. There was no association between the K-ras point mutation and the age at diagnosis, sex, or presence of previous or concurrent neoplasms. Tumors positive for K-ras point mutations tended to be smaller and less differentiated than those without mutations. The K-ras codon-12 point mutation was a strong (and unfavorable) prognostic factor: 12 of the 19 patients with K-ras point-mutation-positive tumors died during the follow-up period, as compared with 16 of the 50 patients with no mutation in the K-ras oncogene (P = 0.002). This difference in prognosis was also reflected in the duration of disease-free survival (P = 0.038) and in the number of deaths due to cancer (P less than 0.001). The presence of K-ras point mutations defines a subgroup of patients with lung adenocarcinoma in whom the prognosis is very poor and disease-free survival is not usually long despite radical resection and a small tumor load.",cancer
1087,Dual disruption of DNA repair and telomere maintenance for the treatment of head and neck cancer.,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP) and the Mre11, Rad50, and Nbs1 (MRN) complex are key regulators of DNA repair, and have been recently shown to independently regulate telomere length. Sensitivity of cancers to PARPi is largely dependent on the BRCAness of the cells. Unfortunately, the vast majority of cancers are BRCA-proficient. In this study, therefore, we investigated whether a targeted molecular ""hit"" on the MRN complex, which is upstream of BRCA, can effectively sensitize BRCA-proficient head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) to PARP inhibitor (PARPi). Human HNSCC cell lines and a mouse model with HNSCC xenografts were used in this study. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to evaluate the effects and underlying mechanisms of dual molecular disruption of PARP and the MRN complex, using a pharmacologic inhibitor and a dominant-negative Nbs1 expression vector, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that downregulation of the MRN complex disrupts homologous recombination, and, when combined with PARPi, leads to accumulation of lethal DNA double-strand breaks. Moreover, we show that PARPi and MRN complex disruption induces significantly shortening telomere length. Together, our results demonstrate that dual disruption of these pathways causes significant cell death in BRCA-proficient tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Our study, for the first time, elucidates a novel mechanism for MRN complex and PARP inhibition beyond DNA repair, demonstrating the feasibility of a dual disruption approach that extends the utility of PARPi to the treatment of BRCA-proficient cancers.",cancer
1148,Clinicopathologic analysis of breast cancers with PIK3CA mutations in Japanese women.,"Somatic mutations of PIK3CA, which encodes the p110alpha catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, have recently been shown to play an important role in the pathogenesis and progression of human breast cancers. In this study, the frequency of PIK3CA mutations and their relationship with clinicopathologic and biological variables were investigated in Japanese breast cancers. Mutational analysis of PIK3CA was done in 188 primary breast cancers of Japanese women. Relationship of these mutations with various clinicopathologic variables [histologic type, tumor size, histologic grade, lymph node status, estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha and progesterone receptor status, and prognosis], biological variables [phospho-AKT (pAKT) and HER2 expression determined by immunohistochemistry], and p53 mutation status was studied. Missense mutations of PIK3CA were found in 44 of 158 invasive ductal carcinomas, 4 of 10 invasive lobular carcinomas, 1 of 4 mucinous carcinomas, 2 of 2 squamous carcinomas, and 2 of 2 apocrine carcinomas, but no mutation was found in 12 noninvasive ductal carcinomas. PIK3CA-mutated tumors were found to be more likely to be ER-alpha positive (P < 0.05) and pAKT positive (P < 0.05). There was no significant association between PIK3CA mutations and p53 mutation status. PIK3CA mutations were significantly (P < 0.05) associated with a favorable prognosis, and multivariate analysis showed that PIK3CA mutation status was a significant (P < 0.05) prognostic factor independent of the other conventional prognostic factors. The frequency of PIK3CA mutations in Japanese breast cancers is similar to that of Caucasian breast cancers. Association of PIK3CA mutations with positive pAKT and positive ER-alpha suggests that PIK3CA mutations might exert their effects through activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT/ER-alpha pathway. PIK3CA mutations seem to have a potential to be used as an indicator of favorable prognosis.",cancer
1100,Association between high levels of expression of the TRK gene and favorable outcome in human neuroblastoma.,"The nerve growth factor receptor is expressed in some neuroblastomas, in which its primary component is encoded by the TRK protooncogene. To determine the relation of the expression of TRK messenger RNA in neuroblastomas to other clinical and laboratory variables, we studied frozen tumor samples from 77 patients. In addition, we tested two primary neuroblastomas that expressed TRK for responsiveness to nerve growth factor. TRK expression strongly correlated with favorable tumor stage (I, II, and IVS vs. III and IV), younger age (< 1 year vs. > or = 1 year), normal N-myc copy number, and low level of N-myc expression. N-myc amplification (indicated by a high copy number) correlated with advanced tumor stage, older age, an adrenal site of the primary tumor, low level of expression of TRK, and high level of expression of N-myc. Analysis of five-year cumulative-survival rates demonstrated an association of a very favorable outcome with a high level of TRK expression (86 percent vs. 14 percent) and with normal N-myc copy number (84 percent vs. 0 percent). Univariate analysis showed that these two variables were the most powerful predictors of outcome (chi-square = 51.30, P < 0.001; and chi-square = 93.61, P < 0.001, respectively). TRK expression still had significant prognostic value when the analysis was restricted to tumors without N-myc amplification. In primary cultures of neuroblastoma cells expressing TRK, exposure to nerve growth factor induced early gene expression and neurite outgrowth, but deprivation of nerve growth factor led to neuronal cell death. A high level of expression of the TRK proto-oncogene in a neuroblastoma is strongly predictive of a favorable outcome. A tumor with a functional nerve growth factor receptor may be dependent on the neurotrophin nerve growth factor for survival and may regress in its absence, allowing a new approach to the treatment of certain patients with neuroblastoma.",cancer
212,Targeting the BRAF V600E mutation in multiple myeloma.,"In multiple myeloma, there has been little progress in the specific therapeutic targeting of oncogenic mutations. Whole-genome sequencing data have recently revealed that a subset of patients carry an activating mutation (V600E) in the BRAF kinase. To uncover the clinical relevance of this mutation in multiple myeloma, we correlated the mutation status in primary tumor samples from 379 patients with myeloma with disease outcome. We found a significantly higher incidence of extramedullary disease and a shorter overall survival in mutation carriers when compared with controls. Most importantly, we report on a patient with confirmed BRAF V600E mutation and relapsed myeloma with extensive extramedullary disease, refractory to all approved therapeutic options, who has rapidly and durably responded to low doses of the mutation-specific BRAF inhibitor vermurafenib. Collectively, we provide evidence for the development of the BRAF V600E mutation in the context of clonal evolution and describe the prognostic and therapeutic relevance of this targetable mutation.",cancer
173,Prognostic role of PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer: cohort study and literature review.,"Mutations in PIK3CA [the gene encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)] play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis. Experimental evidence suggests that PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations trigger different biologic effects, and that concomitant mutations in both exons 9 and 20 synergistically enhance tumorigenic effects. Thus, we hypothesized that PIK3CA exon 9 and exon 20 mutations might have differential effects on clinical outcome in colorectal cancer, and that concomitant PIK3CA exon 9 and 20 mutations might confer aggressive tumor behavior. We sequenced PIK3CA by pyrosequencing in 1,170 rectal and colon cancers in two prospective cohort studies, and found 189 (16%) PIK3CA mutated tumors. Mortality HR according to PIK3CA status was computed using Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for clinical and molecular features, including microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, LINE-1 methylation, and BRAF and KRAS mutations. Compared with PIK3CA wild-type cases, patients with concomitant PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 experienced significantly worse cancer-specific survival [log-rank P = 0.031; multivariate HR = 3.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.28-9.62] and overall survival (log-rank P = 0.0008; multivariate HR = 2.68; 95% CI: 1.24-5.77). PIK3CA mutation in either exon 9 or 20 alone was not significantly associated with patient survival. No significant interaction of PIK3CA mutation with BRAF or KRAS mutation was observed in survival analysis. Coexistence of PIK3CA (the PI3K p110α subunit) exon 9 and 20 mutations, but not PIK3CA mutation in either exon 9 or 20 alone, is associated with poor prognosis of colorectal cancer patients.",cancer
435,AR-V7 and resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone in prostate cancer.,"The androgen-receptor isoform encoded by splice variant 7 lacks the ligand-binding domain, which is the target of enzalutamide and abiraterone, but remains constitutively active as a transcription factor. We hypothesized that detection of androgen-receptor splice variant 7 messenger RNA (AR-V7) in circulating tumor cells from men with advanced prostate cancer would be associated with resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. We used a quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assay to evaluate AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells from prospectively enrolled patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who were initiating treatment with either enzalutamide or abiraterone. We examined associations between AR-V7 status (positive vs. negative) and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rates (the primary end point), freedom from PSA progression (PSA progression-free survival), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival, and overall survival. A total of 31 enzalutamide-treated patients and 31 abiraterone-treated patients were enrolled, of whom 39% and 19%, respectively, had detectable AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells. Among men receiving enzalutamide, AR-V7-positive patients had lower PSA response rates than AR-V7-negative patients (0% vs. 53%, P=0.004) and shorter PSA progression-free survival (median, 1.4 months vs. 6.0 months; P<0.001), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (median, 2.1 months vs. 6.1 months; P<0.001), and overall survival (median, 5.5 months vs. not reached; P=0.002). Similarly, among men receiving abiraterone, AR-V7-positive patients had lower PSA response rates than AR-V7-negative patients (0% vs. 68%, P=0.004) and shorter PSA progression-free survival (median, 1.3 months vs. not reached; P<0.001), clinical or radiographic progression-free survival (median, 2.3 months vs. not reached; P<0.001), and overall survival (median, 10.6 months vs. not reached, P=0.006). The association between AR-V7 detection and therapeutic resistance was maintained after adjustment for expression of full-length androgen receptor messenger RNA. Detection of AR-V7 in circulating tumor cells from patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer may be associated with resistance to enzalutamide and abiraterone. These findings require large-scale prospective validation. (Funded by the Prostate Cancer Foundation and others.).",cancer
1645,Genetically determined ancestry is more informative than self-reported race in HIV-infected and -exposed children.,"The Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study (PHACS), the largest ongoing longitudinal study of perinatal HIV-infected (PHIV) and HIV-exposed, uninfected (PHEU) children in the United States, comprises the Surveillance Monitoring of Antiretroviral Therapy [ART] Toxicities (SMARTT) Study in PHEU children and the Adolescent Master Protocol (AMP) that includes PHIV and PHEU children ≥7 years. Although race/ethnicity is often used to assess health outcomes, this approach remains controversial and may fail to accurately reflect the backgrounds of ancestry-diverse populations as represented in the PHACS participants.In this study, we compared genetically determined ancestry (GDA) and self-reported race/ethnicity (SRR) in the PHACS cohort. GDA was estimated using a highly discriminative panel of 41 single nucleotide polymorphisms and compared to SRR. Because SRR was similar between the PHIV and PHEU, and between the AMP and SMARTT cohorts, data for all unique 1958 participants were combined.According to SRR, 63% of study participants identified as Black/African-American, 27% White, and 34% Hispanic. Using the highest percentage of ancestry/ethnicity to identify GDA, 9.5% of subjects were placed in the incorrect superpopulation based on SRR. When ≥50% or ≥75% GDA of a given superpopulation was required, 12% and 25%, respectively, of subjects were placed in the incorrect superpopulation based on SRR, and the percent of subjects classified as multiracial increased. Of 126 participants with unidentified SRR, 71% were genetically identified as Eurasian.GDA provides a more robust assessment of race/ethnicity when compared to self-report, and study participants with unidentified SRR could be assigned GDA using genetic markers. In addition, identification of continental ancestry removes the taxonomic identification of race as a variable when identifying risk for clinical outcomes.",nonCancer

Cytogenetic and molecular alterations are strong prognostic factors, which have been used to individualize treatment. Here, we studied the impact of TP53 mutations on the outcome of AML patients with adverse cytogenetic risk treated with allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Samples of 97 patients with AML and adverse-risk cytogenetics who had received a HSCT within three randomized trials were analysed. Complete sequencing of the TP53 coding region was performed using next generation sequencing. The median age was 51 years. Overall, TP53 mutations were found in 40 patients (41%). With a median follow up of 67 months, the three-year probabilities of overall survival (OS) and event-free survival for patients with TP53 wild type were 33% [95% confidence interval (CI), 21% to 45%] and 24% (95% CI, 13% to 35%) compared to 10% (95% CI, 0% to 19%) and 8% (95% CI, 0% to 16%) (P = 0·002 and P = 0·007) for those with mutated TP53, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the TP53-mutation status had a negative impact on OS (Hazard Ratio = 1·7; P = 0·066).

1515,Evaluation of cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of pesticide mixtures on lymphocytes.,"The cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of pesticide mixtures viz. endosulfan + chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos + profenofos, and endosulfan + profenofos were evaluated on cultured human peripheral blood lymphocytes using assays for cell viability, and genotoxicity using chromosomal aberrations test and comet assay. The LC50 values for cytotoxicity were 3.50 μM, 4.18 μM, and 10.5 μM for profenofos, endosulfan, and chlorpyrifos respectively. When combined in equimolar concentrations, the LC50 values for cytotoxicity were 1.4 μM, 1.8 μM, and 2.0 μM for endosulfan + chlorpyrifos, chlorpyrifos + profenofos, and endosulfan + profenofos, respectively. Higher concentrations of individual pesticides (0.5-4.0 μM) but very low concentrations of pesticide mixtures caused significant DNA damage. Additive index values indicated a synergistic effect of toxicity for endosulfan + chlorpyrifos combination (1.12 TTU). The binary mixture of chlorpyrifos + profenofos showed an additive toxicity (0.46 TTU) while an antagonistic effect was observed for endosulfan + profenofos combination. Synergism could be due to these complementary pesticides simultaneously acting in different ways, magnifying their efficacy, whereas an additive interaction would imply that the chemicals are acting by the same mechanism and at the same target. Analysis of toxicity of pesticide mixtures may serve as important biomarker for occupational and household exposure to pesticides, with different modes of action.",nonCancer
1210,Good response to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma of complex epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations with the classical mutation pattern.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are usually detected in lung adenocarcinoma and are associated with a response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, not all EGFR mutations have similarly high clinical response rates. This study aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and response to gefitinib in lung adenocarcinoma patients with complex EGFR mutations. Three hundred thirty-nine specimens of lung adenocarcinoma from patients treated with gefitinib were collected for EGFR sequencing. Nineteen patients with complex EGFR mutations were enrolled for the study after excluding three patients with the EGFR T790M mutation, which confers resistance to gefitinib. Among the 19 patients, 12 had complex mutations with the classical mutation pattern (L858R or deletion in exon 19). When compared with those without the classical mutation pattern, patients with this mutation pattern had a higher response rate (83% versus 29%), longer progression-free survival duration (median, 12.7 months versus 4.9 months), and longer overall survival time (median, 24.7 months versus 12.3 months) after gefitinib treatment. Comparing patients harboring complex EGFR mutations with a classical mutation pattern with those harboring single classical mutations, there were no statistical differences in the response rate (83% versus 73%), progression-free survival time (median, 12.7 months versus 8.1 months,) or overall survival time (median, 24.7 months versus 16.4 months). Patients with complex EGFR mutations with the classical mutation pattern had the same response rate, progression-free survival duration, and overall survival time as those with single classical mutations. EGFR TKIs may be the choice of treatment for this type of lung adenocarcinoma.",cancer

All patients evaluated by the general surgery department through outpatient clinics, clinical video teleconferencing, and e-consultations from October 2011 through September 2014 were included. Patients evaluated through the emergency department or as inpatient consults were excluded.|The surgery service and systems redesign service held a value stream analysis in FY 2013, culminating in multiple rapid process improvement workshops. Multidisciplinary teams identified systemic inefficiencies and strategies to improve interdepartmental and patient communication to reduce canceled consultations and cases, diagnostic rework, and no-shows. High-priority triage with enhanced operating room flexibility was instituted to reduce scheduling wait times. General surgery department pilot projects were then implemented mid-FY 2013.|Planned outcome measures included wait time, clinic and telehealth volume, number of no-shows, and operative volume. Paired t tests were used to identify differences in outcome measures after the institution of reforms.|Following rapid process improvement workshop project rollouts, mean (SD) patient wait times for elective general surgical procedures decreased from 33.4 (8.3) days in FY 2012 to 26.0 (9.5) days in FY 2013 (P = .02). In FY 2014, mean (SD) wait times were half the value of the previous FY at 12.0 (2.1) days (P = .07). This was a 3-fold decrease from wait times in FY 2012 (P = .02). Operative volume increased from 931 patients in FY 2012 to 1090 in FY 2013 and 1072 in FY 2014. Combined clinic, telehealth, and e-consultation encounters increased from 3131 in FY 2012 to 3460 in FY 2013 and 3517 in FY 2014, while the number of no-shows decreased from 366 in FY 2012 to 227 in FY 2014 (P = .02).|Improvement in the overall surgical patient experience can stem from multidisciplinary collaboration among systems redesign personnel, clinicians, and surgical staff to reduce systemic inefficiencies. Monitoring and follow-up of system efficiency measures and the employment of lean practices and process improvements can have positive short- and long-term effects on wait times, clinical throughput, and patient care and satisfaction.",nonCancer
12,High molecular response rate of polycythemia vera patients treated with pegylated interferon alpha-2a.,"V617F JAK2 mutation is a reliable molecular marker of polycythemia vera (PV), potentially useful to monitor the effect of treatments in this disease. In a phase 2 study of pegylated (peg) IFN-alpha-2a in PV, we performed prospective sequential quantitative evaluation of the percentage of mutated JAK2 allele (%V617F) by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The %V617F decreased in 24 (89%) of 27 treated patients, from a mean of 49% to a mean of 27% (mean decrease of 44%; P < .001), and no evidence for a plateau was observed. In one patient, mutant JAK2 was no longer detectable after 12 months. In 3 patients homozygous for the mutation, reappearance of 50% of wild-type allele was observed during treatment. The results seem to confirm the hypothesis that IFN-alpha preferentially targets the malignant clone in PV and show that %V617F assessment using a quantitative method may provide the first tool to monitor minimal residual disease in PV. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00241241.",cancer
2087,Environmental chemicals modulate polar bear (Ursus maritimus) peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and adipogenesis in vitro.,"We studied interactions between polar bear peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (pbPPARG) and selected compounds using a luciferase reporter assay and predictions through molecular docking. Furthermore, we studied adipogenesis by liver and adipose tissue extracts from a polar bear and three synthetic mixtures of contaminants in murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and polar bear adipose tissue-derived stem cells (pbASCs). PCB153 and p,p'-DDE antagonized pbPPARG, although their predicted receptor-ligand affinity was weak. PBDEs, tetrabromobisphenol A, and PCB170 had a weak agonistic effect on pbPPARG, while hexabromocyclododecane, bisphenol A, oxychlordane, and endosulfan were weak antagonists. pbPPARG-mediated luciferase activity was suppressed by synthetic contaminant mixtures reflecting levels measured in polar bear adipose tissue, as were transcript levels of PPARG and the PPARG target gene fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) in pbASCs. Contaminant extracts from polar bear tissues enhanced triglyceride accumulation in murine 3T3-L1 cells and pbASCs, whereas triglyceride accumulation was not affected by the synthetic mixtures. Chemical characterization of extracts using non-target methods revealed presence of exogenous compounds that have previously been reported to induce adipogenesis. These compounds included phthalates, tonalide, and nonylphenol. In conclusion, major legacy contaminants in polar bear adipose tissue exert antagonistic effects on PPARG, but adipogenesis by a mixture containing emerging compounds may be enhanced through PPARG or other pathways.",nonCancer
188,Prognostic significance of Bcl-2 protein expression and Bcl-2 gene rearrangement in diffuse aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.,"The prognostic significance of Bcl-2 protein expression and bcl-2 gene rearrangement in diffuse large cell lymphomas (DLCL) is controversial. Bcl-2 protein expression prevents apoptosis and may have an important role in clinical drug resistance. The presence of a bcl-2 gene rearrangement in de novo DLCL suggests a possible follicle center cell origin and perhaps a distinct clinical behavior more akin to low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The purpose of this study was to determine the impact of Bcl-2 protein expression and bcl-2 gene rearrangement (mbr and mcr) on survival of a cohort of patients with DLCL who were uniformly evaluated and treated with effective chemotherapy. Patients included the original MACOP-B cohort (n = 121) and the initial 18 patients treated with the VACOP-B regimen (total = 139). All patients had advanced-stage disease, were 16 to 70 years old, and corresponded to Working Formulation categories F, G, or H. No patients had prior treatment, discordant lymphoma, or human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity. Paraffin sections from diagnostic biopsies were analyzed for bcl-2 gene rearrangement including mbr and mcr breakpoints by polymerase chain reaction and Bcl-2 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. With a median follow-up of 81 months, overall (OS), disease-free (DFS), and relapse-free survival (RFS) were measured to determine the prognostic significance of these parameters. Analyzable DNA was present in 118 of 139 (85%) cases, with 14 demonstrating a bcl-2 rearrangement (11 mbr, 3 mcr). All 14 of these bcl-2 gene rearrangement-positive cases were found in the 102 patients with a B-cell immunophenotype, but the presence of this rearrangement had no significant influence on survival. Bcl-2 protein expression was interpretable in 116 of 139 (83%) cases, with immunopositivity detected in 54 of 116 (47%). Using a cut-off of greater than 10% Bcl-2 immunopositive tumor cells for analysis, positive Bcl-2 protein expression was seen in 28 of 116 (24%) patients and the presence of this expression correlated with decreased 8-year OS (34% v 60%, P < .01), DFS (32% v 66%, P < .001), and RFS (25% v 59%, P < .001). Bcl-2 protein expression remained significant in multivariate analysis that included the clinical international prognostic index factors and immunophenotype (P < .02). In conclusion, although bcl-2 gene rearrangement status could not be shown to have an impact on outcome, Bcl-2 protein expression is a strong significant predictor of OS, DFS, and RFS in DLCLs.",cancer
295,Genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 Arg399Gln is associated with survival in non-small-cell lung cancer patients treated with gemcitabine/platinum.,"Elevated DNA-repair capacity has been related to chemoresistance of platinum doublet chemotherapy in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We evaluated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms of DN- repair genes excision repair cross-complementing group 1 (ERCC1), ERCC2, x-ray repair cross-complementing group 1 (XRCC1), XRCC3, and RRM1 associate with treatment outcome in NSCLC patients receiving gemcitabine plus platinum as their first-line chemotherapy. Genotyping for eight polymorphisms in five DNA-repair genes was performed with the GenomeLab nucleotide polymorphismstream Genotyping System in 62 advanced NSCLC patients in a training set and 45 patients in a validation set treated with gemcitabine/platinum. In the training set, the wild-type genotype of XRCC1 Arg399Gln (G/G) was associated with decreased median overall survival (OS) (22 months, 95% confidence interval [CI], 10-34 months versus not reached, log-rank test, p = 0.005) than those carrying variant genotypes (G/A+A/A). In addition, there was a statistically significant longer median OS in patients carrying wild-type ERCC2 Asp312Asn genotype (G/G) (51 months, 95% CI, 19-82 months versus 10 months, log-rank test, p < 0.001) than those carrying heterozygous variant genotypes (G/A). In the multivariate Cox model, we found a significant effect of XRCC1 Arg399Gln (G/A+A/A versus G/G, hazard ratio [HR] 0.290; 95%CI, 0.12-0.705, p = 0.006) and ERCC2 Asp312Asn (G/A versus G/G, HR 14.04; 95% CI, 2.253-87.513, p = 0.005) polymorphisms on patients' OS. In the validation set, only XRCC1 399 Genetic polymorphism of XRCC1 Arg399Gln may be a candidate for contributing interindividual difference in the OS of gemcitabine/platinum-treated advanced NSCLC patients.",cancer
2423,"Antiproliferative/cytotoxic effects of molecular iodine, povidone-iodine and Lugol's solution in different human carcinoma cell lines.","Clinical trials have revealed that molecular iodine (I2) has beneficial effects in fibrocystic breast disease and in cyclic mastalgia. Likewise, povidone-iodine (PVP-I), which is widely used in clinical practice as an antiseptic agent following tumour surgery, has been demonstrated to have cytotoxic effects on colon cancer and ascites tumour cells. Our previous study indicated that the growth of breast cancer and seven other human malignant cell lines was variably diminished by I2 and iodolactones. With the intention of developing an iodine-based anticancer therapy, the present investigations extended these studies by comparing the cytotoxic capacities of I2, potassium iodide (KJ), PVP-I and Lugol's solution on various human carcinoma cell lines. Upon staining the cell nuclei with Hoechst 33342, the cell densities were determined microscopically. While KJ alone did not affect cell proliferation, it enhanced the antiproliferative activity of I2. In addition, PVP-I significantly inhibited the proliferation of human MCF-7 breast carcinoma, IPC melanoma, and A549 and H1299 lung carcinoma cells in a concentration corresponding to 20 µM I2. Likewise, Lugol's solution in concentrations corresponding to 20-80 µM I2 were observed to reduce the growth of MCF-7 cells. Experiments with fresh human blood samples revealed that the antiproliferative activity of PVP-I and I2 is preserved in blood plasma to a high degree. These findings suggest that PVP-I, Lugol's solution, and a combination of iodide and I2 may be potent agents for use in the development of antitumour strategies.",nonCancer
2367,Myxoid chondrosarcoma of the mandible in a 22-year-old man: A case report.,"This study describes a case of myxoid chondrosarcoma of the mandible in a 22-year-old male patient. A tumour in the buccal gingiva of the lower left premolar region had been identified 2 years earlier. Whole-jaw panoramic radiographs showed a hypodense shadow in the mesiodistal area near the roots of teeth 34 and 35. A maxillofacial computed tomography scan revealed a mass in the lower left premolar soft tissue, with a shadow indicating bone destruction, a clear boundary and uniform density. The preliminary diagnosis at the outpatient department was 34-35 epulis. The patient underwent surgery for 34-35 gingival tumour resection, 34 and 35 extraction, and 34 and 35 immediate implantation. The postoperative pathological examination revealed a cellular type extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma of the lower left mandible. Under general anaesthesia, the patient underwent lower left mandibular block and segmental resection, submandibular triangle dissection and vessel disassociation, and musculocutaneous flap repair in the oral and maxillofacial defect area. After 9 months of follow-up, the patient had no complaints of discomfort, and tumour recurrence was not observed on imaging examinations.",nonCancer

(stage IV) with mutated epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFRm+) treated with gefitinib (gef) or with chemotherapy (CT) under real-world conditions. Methods: 285 EGFRm+ pts. of the non-interventional REASON study treated with gef (n = 206) or CT (n = 79) as first-line therapy or with gef (n = 213) or CT (n = 61) in any line throughout the course of therapy were analyzed according to age, gender, smoking history and histology. Results: Compared with CT, patients treated with gef showed prolongation of PFS and OS in all subgroups. PFS was significantly increased in women and non-smokers. OS was significantly increased in women, non-smokers, (ex)-smokers, patients with adenocarcinoma and elderly patients when treated with gef compared to CT. Female gender turned out to be an independent positive predictive factor for OS in patients treated with gef (HRmale: 1.74, p = 0.0009). Conclusion: A clinical benefit of gef was shown for all analyzed clinical subgroups of EGFRm+ pts. This was confirmed for the female gender in a multivariate analysis.",nonCancer
1088,Binimetinib inhibits MEK and is effective against neuroblastoma tumor cells with low NF1 expression.,"Novel therapies are needed for children with high-risk and relapsed neuroblastoma. We hypothesized that MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) inhibition with the novel MEK1/2 inhibitor binimetinib would be effective in neuroblastoma preclinical models. Levels of total and phosphorylated MEK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were examined in primary neuroblastoma tumor samples and in neuroblastoma cell lines by Western blot. A panel of established neuroblastoma tumor cell lines was treated with increasing concentrations of binimetinib, and their viability was determined using MTT assays. Western blot analyses were performed to examine changes in total and phosphorylated MEK and ERK and to measure apoptosis in neuroblastoma tumor cells after binimetinib treatment. NF1 protein levels in neuroblastoma cell lines were determined using Western blot assays. Gene expression of NF1 and MEK1 was examined in relationship to neuroblastoma patient outcomes. Both primary neuroblastoma tumor samples and cell lines showed detectable levels of total and phosphorylated MEK and ERK. IC50 values for cells sensitive to binimetinib ranged from 8 nM to 1.16 μM, while resistant cells did not demonstrate any significant reduction in cell viability with doses exceeding 15 μM. Sensitive cells showed higher endogenous expression of phosphorylated MEK and ERK. Gene expression of NF1, but not MEK1, correlated with patient outcomes in neuroblastoma, and NF1 protein expression also correlated with responses to binimetinib. Neuroblastoma tumor cells show a range of sensitivities to the novel MEK inhibitor binimetinib. In response to binimetinib, sensitive cells demonstrated complete loss of phosphorylated ERK, while resistant cells demonstrated either incomplete loss of ERK phosphorylation or minimal effects on MEK phosphorylation, suggesting alternative mechanisms of resistance. NF1 protein expression correlated with responses to binimetinib, supporting the use of NF1 as a biomarker to identify patients that may respond to MEK inhibition. MEK inhibition therefore represents a potential new therapeutic strategy for neuroblastoma.",cancer
2326,"A comparison of blood gases, biochemistry, and hematology to ecomorphology in a health assessment of pinfish (Lagodon rhomboides).","Despite the promise of hematological parameters and blood chemistry in monitoring the health of marine fishes, baseline data is often lacking for small fishes that comprise central roles in marine food webs. This study establishes blood chemistry and hematological baseline parameters for the pinfish Lagodon rhomboides, a small marine teleost that is among the most dominant members of near-shore estuarine communities of the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico. Given their prominence, pinfishes are an ideal candidate species to use as a model for monitoring changes across a wide range of near-shore marine communities. However, pinfishes exhibit substantial morphological differences associated with a preference for feeding in primarily sea-grass or sand dominated habitats, suggesting that differences in the foraging ecology of individuals could confound health assessments. Here we collect baseline data on the blood physiology of pinfish while assessing the relationship between blood parameters and measured aspects of feeding morphology using data collected from 37 individual fish. Our findings provide new baseline health data for this important near shore fish species and find no evidence for a strong linkage between blood physiology and either sex or measured aspects of feeding morphology. Comparing our hematological and biochemical data to published results from other marine teleost species suggests that analyses of trends in blood value variation correlated with major evolutionary transitions in ecology will shed new light on the physiological changes that underlie the successful diversification of fishes.",nonCancer
1551,Respiratory Outcome after Preterm Birth: A Long and Difficult Journey.,"Despite notable advances in the survival and management of preterm infants in recent decades, chronic lung disease remains a common complication. Approximately one in three infants born preterm (< 32 weeks of gestation) are hospitalized with respiratory problems (mainly due to infections) in their first 2 years of life, and the risk of childhood wheezing is three times higher in this population. By comparison with infants born at term, there seems to be a higher incidence of respiratory morbidity in those born preterm, even in the absence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and in late-preterm babies. Although long-term follow-up data are still not collected systematically, there is evidence of preterm infants' respiratory symptoms, lung function impairments, and radiological abnormalities, tending to persist throughout childhood and into early adulthood. Respiratory conditions associated with preterm birth are often diagnosed and treated as asthma, but the pathophysiological patterns of BPD and asthma are very different. Future research should focus on characterizing preterm infants' pathological pulmonary features by gestational age at birth, and presence or absence of BPD. Improving our current knowledge of the respiratory disorder associated with prematurity might hopefully prompt targeted follow-up protocols, and novel prevention strategies and treatment approaches.",nonCancer
1342,"Structural, Culinary, Nutritional and Anti-Nutritional Properties of High Protein, Gluten Free, 100% Legume Pasta.","Wheat pasta has a compact structure built by a gluten network entrapping starch granules resulting in a low glycemic index, but is nevertheless unsuitable for gluten-intolerant people. High protein gluten-free legume flours, rich in fibers, resistant starch and minerals are thus a good alternative for gluten-free pasta production. In this study, gluten-free pasta was produced exclusively from faba, lentil or black-gram flours. The relationship between their structure, their cooking and Rheological properties and their in-vitro starch digestion was analyzed and compared to cereal gluten-free commercial pasta. Trypsin inhibitory activity, phytic acid and α-galactosides were determined in flours and in cooked pasta. All legume pasta were rich in protein, resistant starch and fibers. They had a thick but weak protein network, which is built during the pasta cooking step. This particular structure altered pasta springiness and increased cooking losses. Black-gram pasta, which is especially rich in soluble fibers, differed from faba and lentil pasta, with high springiness (0.85 vs. 0.75) and less loss during cooking. In comparison to a commercial cereal gluten-free pasta, all the legume pasta lost less material during cooking but was less cohesive and springy. Interestingly, due to their particular composition and structure, lentil and faba pasta released their starch more slowly than the commercial gluten-free pasta during the in-vitro digestion process. Anti-nutritional factors in legumes, such as trypsin inhibitory activity and α-galactosides were reduced by up to 82% and 73%, respectively, by pasta processing and cooking. However, these processing steps had a minor effect on phytic acid. This study demonstrates the advantages of using legumes for the production of gluten-free pasta with a low glycemic index and high nutritional quality.",nonCancer

The increased pulmonary blood flow that results from left-to-right ductal shunting can produce an acute deterioration in lung function and some data suggest that it may increase the risk of chronic lung damage. However, there is no clear evidence that prophylactic or early closure of the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) results in a clear reduction in bronchopulmonary dysplasia. For this reason, and because of the side effects of the available therapies to close the ductus, there is a wide variation in the approach to the PDA in this population and most clinicians will intervene to close the ductus only in cases of significant shunt with hemodynamic decompensation.",nonCancer

We therefore examined the expression and mutations of KIT in 4 primary and 24 metastatic acral and mucosal melanomas. Immunohistochemistry revealed moderate or strong KIT protein expression in 13 (48%) tumors. Sequence analysis revealed K642E and D820Y mutations in two metastases. Amplification of KIT was identified by real-time PCR in 4 tumors, including one that had K642E. Western blot analysis showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor in 8 (62%) of 13 cryopreserved samples, indicating the frequent pathological activation of the receptor in vivo. Phosphorylation of KIT protein was detected in 2 tumors harboring KIT mutations, as well as in one tumor with KIT gene amplification. Furthermore, 5 tumors without detectable KIT gene aberrations showed phosphorylation of the KIT receptor. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) in melanoma cells as well as stromal cells suggests SCF/KIT autocrine and paracrine activation in these tumors. Finally, we found significant growth suppressive effects of sunitinib in two acral melanoma cell lines; one harboring the D820Y mutation and one showing SCF-dependent KIT activation. These results show pathological activation of KIT in a substantial number of metastatic tumors of acral and mucosal melanomas, and suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of sunitinib for these melanomas.",cancer

1453,"Dual ions implantation of zirconium and nitrogen into magnesium alloys for enhanced corrosion resistance, antimicrobial activity and biocompatibility.","Biodegradable magnesium-based alloys have shown great potential for medical applications due to their superior biological performances and mechanical properties. However, on one hand, some side effects including inferior biocompatibility, a local high-alkaline environment and gas cavities caused by a rapid corrosion rate, hinder their clinical application. On the other hand, it is also necessary to endow Mg alloys with antibacterial properties, which are crucial for clinic orthopedic applications. In this study, Zr and N ions are simultaneously implanted into AZ91 Mg alloys by plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII). A modified layer with a thickness of approximately 80nm is formed on the surface of AZ91 Mg alloys, and the hydrophobicity and roughness of these AZ91 Mg alloys obviously increase after Zr and N implantation. The in vitro evaluations including corrosion resistance tests, antimicrobial tests and cytocompatibility and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity tests, revealed that the dual ions implantation of Zr and N not only enhanced the corrosion resistance of the AZ91 Mg alloy but also provided better antimicrobial properties in vitro. Furthermore, the formation of biocompatible metal nitrides and metal oxides layer in the near surface of the Zr-N-implanted AZ91 Mg alloy provided a favorable implantation surface for cell adhesion and growth, which in return further promoted the bone formation in vivo. These promising results suggest that the Zr-N-implanted AZ91 Mg alloy shows potential for future application in the orthopedic field.",nonCancer

711,Structural insight into selectivity and resistance profiles of ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,"Oncogenic ROS1 fusion proteins are molecular drivers in multiple malignancies, including a subset of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The phylogenetic proximity of the ROS1 and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) catalytic domains led to the clinical repurposing of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved ALK inhibitor crizotinib as a ROS1 inhibitor. Despite the antitumor activity of crizotinib observed in both ROS1- and ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, resistance due to acquisition of ROS1 or ALK kinase domain mutations has been observed clinically, spurring the development of second-generation inhibitors. Here, we profile the sensitivity and selectivity of seven ROS1 and/or ALK inhibitors at various levels of clinical development. In contrast to crizotinib's dual ROS1/ALK activity, cabozantinib (XL-184) and its structural analog foretinib (XL-880) demonstrate a striking selectivity for ROS1 over ALK. Molecular dynamics simulation studies reveal structural features that distinguish the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains and contribute to differences in binding site and kinase selectivity of the inhibitors tested. Cell-based resistance profiling studies demonstrate that the ROS1-selective inhibitors retain efficacy against the recently reported CD74-ROS1(G2032R) mutant whereas the dual ROS1/ALK inhibitors are ineffective. Taken together, inhibitor profiling and stringent characterization of the structure-function differences between the ROS1 and ALK kinase domains will facilitate future rational drug design for ROS1- and ALK-driven NSCLC and other malignancies.",cancer

The results showed that Xuebijing injection ameliorated the pathological changes in liver tissues caused by sepsis, and reduced the sepsis-induced elevation in serum ALT and AST levels. Furthermore, Xuebijing injection markedly downregulated the expression of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin (IL)-6, and upregulated the expression of IL-10. More importantly, SOCS1 expression levels at the protein and mRNA levels were further increased by Xuebijing. These findings demonstrate that Xuebijing injection can significantly alleviate liver injury in CLP-induced septic rats via the regulation of inflammatory cytokine secretion and the promotion of SOCS1 expression. The protective effects of Xuebijing injection suggest its therapeutic potential in the treatment of CLP-induced liver injury.",nonCancer
629,Prognostic Subgroups among Patients with Stage II Colon Cancer.,"Colon cancer has traditionally been treated surgically. However, many cases of colon cancer are systemic at the time of diagnosis, and apparently curative surgery is followed at a later date by tumor recurrence as a consequence of circulating tumor cells before the surgery. Adjuvant medical therapies are designed to prevent recurrences after surgical resection. The current standard for clinical prognostication relies principally on pathological staging. In early-stage colon cancers (stages I and II), all the tumor is contained within the wall of the colon. Less than 10% of patients with stage I disease have a recurrence, and adjuvant chemotherapy is . . .",cancer
1217,A phase 2 trial of ponatinib in Philadelphia chromosome-positive leukemias.,"Ponatinib is a potent oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor of unmutated and mutated BCR-ABL, including BCR-ABL with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor-refractory threonine-to-isoleucine mutation at position 315 (T315I). We conducted a phase 2 trial of ponatinib in patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph-positive ALL). We enrolled 449 heavily pretreated patients who had CML or Ph-positive ALL with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib or who had the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. Ponatinib was administered at an initial dose of 45 mg once daily. The median follow-up was 15 months. Among 267 patients with chronic-phase CML, 56% had a major cytogenetic response (51% of patients with resistance to or unacceptable side effects from dasatinib or nilotinib and 70% of patients with the T315I mutation), 46% had a complete cytogenetic response (40% and 66% in the two subgroups, respectively), and 34% had a major molecular response (27% and 56% in the two subgroups, respectively). Responses were observed regardless of the baseline BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation status and were durable; the estimated rate of a sustained major cytogenetic response of at least 12 months was 91%. No single BCR-ABL mutation conferring resistance to ponatinib was detected. Among 83 patients with accelerated-phase CML, 55% had a major hematologic response and 39% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 62 patients with blast-phase CML, 31% had a major hematologic response and 23% had a major cytogenetic response. Among 32 patients with Ph-positive ALL, 41% had a major hematologic response and 47% had a major cytogenetic response. Common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (in 37% of patients), rash (in 34%), dry skin (in 32%), and abdominal pain (in 22%). Serious arterial thrombotic events were observed in 9% of patients; these events were considered to be treatment-related in 3%. A total of 12% of patients discontinued treatment because of an adverse event. Ponatinib had significant antileukemic activity across categories of disease stage and mutation status.

1295,Pediatric Neuromodulation Comes of Age.,"This special issue surveys recent work and underscores the challenges of psychiatric brain stimulation research with child and adolescent populations. The field of child and adolescent psychopharmacology is replete with examples of potential pitfalls in the assumption that ""children are little adults."" Arguably, younger age portends more neurobiological and descriptive heterogeneity in research pursuits and clinical practice. For existing brain stimulation modalities, there are a paucity of translational models to design studies for youth and no well-studied dosing schemes. The long-term positive and negative effects of neuromodulation interventions in youth are unknown. Inherent pragmatic and ethical limitations often present barriers for participant recruitment and will necessitate innovative approaches to study design and team efforts. These challenges are not insurmountable, and sustained efforts will advance the growing field of pediatric neuromodulation.",nonCancer
2170,Thrombomodulin promotes focal adhesion kinase activation and contributes to angiogenesis by binding to fibronectin.,"Angiogenesis promotes tumor growth and metastasis. Cell adhesion molecules interact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) and increase cell adhesion and migration during angiogenesis. Thrombomodulin (TM) is a cell surface transmembrane glycoprotein expressed in endothelial cells. However, the function and significance of TM in cell-matrix interactions and angiogenesis remain unclear. Here, we first demonstrated that recombinant lectin-like domain of TM interacts with an ECM protein, fibronectin, and identified the N-terminal 70-kDa domain of fibronectin as the TM-binding site. Exogenous expression of TM in TM-deficient A2058 melanoma cells enhanced cell adhesion and migration on fibronectin and invasion on Matrigel. In addition, TM increased focal adhesion kinase (FAK) phosphorylation and matrix metalloproteinase-9 production. In mice bearing subcutaneous B16F10 melanoma tumors, immunofluorescence analysis indicated that TM was highly expressed and co-localized with fibronectin on the tumor vasculature. The interaction between TM and fibronectin in tumor blood vessels was also validated by the proximity ligation assay. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells, up-regulation of TM by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a tumor angiogenic factor, promoted cell adhesion and tube formation, whereas TM knockdown by RNA interference attenuated VEGF-induced cell adhesion and tube formation. In summary, TM promotes angiogenesis by enhancing cell adhesion, migration, and FAK activation through interaction with fibronectin. TM may represent a novel target for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis.",nonCancer

1455,Posterior Corneal Characteristics of Cataract Patients with High Myopia.,"To evaluate the characteristics of the posterior corneal surface in patients with high myopia before cataract surgery.|We performed a cross-sectional study at the Eye and ENT Hospital of Fudan University, Shanghai, China. Corneal astigmatism and axial length were measured with a rotating Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam) and partial coherence interferometry (IOLMaster) in a high-myopia study group of 167 eyes (axial length ≥ 26 mm) and a control group of 150 eyes (axial length > 20 mm and < 25 mm).|Total corneal astigmatism and anterior corneal astigmatism values were higher in the high-myopia group than in the control group. There was no significant difference in posterior corneal astigmatism between the high-myopia study group and the control group. In the study group, the mean posterior corneal astigmatism (range 0 - -0.9 diopters) was -0.29 diopters (D) ± 0.17 standard deviations (SD). The steep corneal meridian was aligned vertically (60°-120°) in 87.43% of eyes for the posterior corneal surface, and did not change with increasing age. There was a significant correlation (r = 0.235, p = 0.002) between posterior corneal astigmatism and anterior corneal astigmatism, especially when the anterior corneal surface showed with-the-rule (WTR) astigmatism (r = 0.452, p = 0.000). There was a weak negative correlation between posterior corneal astigmatism and age (r = -0.15, p = 0.053) in the high-myopia group. Compared with total corneal astigmatism values, the anterior corneal measurements alone overestimated WTR astigmatism by a mean of 0.27 ± 0.18 D in 68.75% of eyes, underestimated against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism by a mean of 0.41 ± 0.28 D in 88.89% of eyes, and underestimated oblique astigmatism by a mean of 0.24 ± 0.13 D in 63.64% of eyes.|Posterior corneal astigmatism decreased with age and remained as ATR astigmatism in most cases of high myopia. There was a significant correlation between posterior corneal astigmatism and anterior corneal astigmatism when anterior corneal astigmatism was WTR. If posterior corneal astigmatism is not accounted for when selecting toric intraocular lenses for high-myopia patients, the use of anterior corneal astigmatism measurements alone will lead to overestimation of WTR astigmatism and underestimation of ATR and oblique astigmatism.",nonCancer

Phospholipase C zeta (PLCζ) and postacrosomal sheath WW domain binding protein (PAWP) are the main candidates in sperm taking responsibility for oocyte activation during fertilization. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the expression of these two genes at RNA and protein levels in globozoospermic individuals and compare the results with fertile individuals.|In this experimental study, semen samples of 21 infertile men with globozoospermia and 25 fertile men were collected. Expression of PLCζ and PAWP at RNA and protein levels were assessed and compared between two groups by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot, respectively.|Expression of both PLCζ and PAWP were significantly reduced at RNA and protein levels in infertile men with globozoospermia compared to fertile men.|This is the first study that simultaneously assessing the respective factors in a large population of globozoospermia, suggested that intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) along with artificial oocyte activation may rescue failed fertilization in routine ICSI.",nonCancer
2452,Adriamycin resistance-associated prohibitin gene inhibits proliferation of human osteosarcoma MG63 cells by interacting with oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.,"The resistance of cancer cells to chemotherapeutic agents is a major obstacle for successful chemotherapy, and the mechanism of chemoresistance remains unclear. The present study developed an adriamycin-resistant human osteosarcoma MG-63 sub-line (MG-63/ADR), and identified differentially expressed proteins that may be associated with adriamycin resistance. Two dimensional gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis and a protein identification assay were performed. Western blot analysis was used to examine the prohibitin (PHB) levels in the MG-63/ADR cells. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was utilized to detect adriamycin resistant-associated genes. Laser-scanning confocal microscope was employed to examine the colocalization of PHB with v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-myc), FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-fos), tumor protein p53 and retinoblastoma 1 (Rb). In addition, the full length of the open reading frame of human PHB was subcloned into a lentiviral vector pLVX-puro. The proliferative rate of MG-63 cells was also investigated. The overall protein expression in MG-63/ADR cells was clearly suppressed. Three notable protein regions, representing high mobility group box 1, Ras homolog gene family, member A, and PHB, were identified to be significantly altered in MG-63/ADR cells when compared with its parental cells. Therefore, PHB modulated the chemoresistance of MG-63/ADR cells by interacting with multiple oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes (c-myc, c-fos, p53 and Rb). In addition, overexpression of PHB decreases the proliferative rate of MG-63 cells. In conclusion, PHB is an adriamycin resistance-associated gene, which may inhibit the proliferation of human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells by interacting with the oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, c-myc, c-fos, p53 and Rb.",nonCancer
2493,MiR-10a improves hepatic fibrosis by regulating the TGFβl/Smads signal transduction pathway.,"The aim of the present study was to examine the expression variation of the mouse hepatic fibrosis tissue transforming growth factor (TGF)-βl/Smads signal transduction pathway and its correlation with progression of hepatic fibrosis. The promotion effect of microRNA (miR)-10a on hepatic fibrosis and its possible mechanism was also assessed. Forty healthy female 8-week-old C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into the control group (intraperitoneal injection of 5 µl/g normal saline, twice per week for 8 weeks) and the hepatic fibrosis group (intraperitoneal injection of 5 µl/g 10% CCI4 olive oil, twice per week for 8 weeks), with 20 mice per group. RT-PCR was used to test miR-10a expression in cells in the control and hepatic fibrosis groups. Cell culture and transfection of miR-10a mimics were conducted in the two groups and a Cell Counting Kit-8 was used to test the expression of TGF-β1 and Smad7 in hepatic fibroblasts. It was found that in comparison with the control group, miR-10a expression was significantly increased in the hepatic fibrosis group compared with the control group (P<0.05). The expression quantity of miR-10a was significantly increased in the transfection group compared with the control group (P<0.05). A high expression of miR-10a significantly improved TGF-β1 expression and reduced Smad7 expression in the hepatic fibrosis group (P<0.05). In conclusion, miR-10a expression was high in mouse hepatic tissues, transfection of miR-10a mimics significantly promoted the cell proliferation of hepatic fibrosis, and miR-10a improved hepatic fibrosis by regulating the TGF-βl/Smads signal transduction pathway.",nonCancer
9,"PDGFRA mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors: frequency, spectrum and in vitro sensitivity to imatinib.","Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) commonly harbor oncogenic mutations of the KIT tyrosine kinase, which is a target for the kinase inhibitor imatinib. A subset of GISTs, however, contains mutations in the homologous kinase platelet derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), and the most common of these mutations is resistant to imatinib in vitro. Little is known of the other types of PDGFRA mutations that occur in GISTs. We determined the KIT and PDGFRA mutation status of 1,105 unique GISTs using a combination of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. 66 in exon 18, 11 in exon 12, and three in exon 14. Transient expression of representative PDGFRA isoforms in CHO cells revealed imatinib sensitivity of exon 12 mutations (SPDHE566-571R and insertion ER561-562) and an exon 14 substitution (N659K). However, most isoforms with a substitution involving codon D842 in exon 18 (D842V, RD841-842KI, DI842-843IM) were resistant to the drug, with the exception of D842Y. Interestingly, other mutations in exon 18 (D846Y, N848K, Y849K and HDSN845-848P) were all imatinib sensitive. Proliferation studies with BA/F3 cell lines stably expressing selected PDGFRA mutant isoforms supported these findings. Including our cases, there are 289 reported PDGFRA-mutant GISTs, of which 181 (62.6%) had the imatinib-resistant substitution D842V. However, our findings suggest that more than one third of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations may respond to imatinib and that mutation screening may be helpful in the management of these tumors.",cancer
1065,CX-5461 is a DNA G-quadruplex stabilizer with selective lethality in BRCA1/2 deficient tumours.,"G-quadruplex DNAs form four-stranded helical structures and are proposed to play key roles in different cellular processes. Targeting G-quadruplex DNAs for cancer treatment is a very promising prospect. Here, we show that CX-5461 is a G-quadruplex stabilizer, with specific toxicity against BRCA deficiencies in cancer cells and polyclonal patient-derived xenograft models, including tumours resistant to PARP inhibition. Exposure to CX-5461, and its related drug CX-3543, blocks replication forks and induces ssDNA gaps or breaks. The BRCA and NHEJ pathways are required for the repair of CX-5461 and CX-3543-induced DNA damage and failure to do so leads to lethality. These data strengthen the concept of G4 targeting as a therapeutic approach, specifically for targeting HR and NHEJ deficient cancers and other tumours deficient for DNA damage repair. CX-5461 is now in advanced phase I clinical trial for patients with BRCA1/2 deficient tumours (Canadian trial, NCT02719977, opened May 2016).",cancer
163,Cyclin E and survival in patients with breast cancer.,"Cyclin E, a regulator of the cell cycle, affects the behavior of breast-cancer cells. We investigated whether levels of cyclin E in the tumor correlated with survival among patients with breast cancer. Tumor tissue from 395 patients with breast cancer was assayed for cyclin E, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, and the HER-2/neu oncogene with the use of Western blot analysis. Full-length, low-molecular-weight, and total cyclin E were measured. Immunohistochemical assessments of cyclin E were also made of 256 tumors. We sought correlations between levels of these molecular markers and disease-specific and overall survival. The median follow-up was 6.4 years. A high level of the low-molecular-weight isoforms of cyclin E, as detected by Western blotting, correlated strongly with disease-specific survival whether axillary lymph nodes were negative or positive for metastases (P<0.001). Among 114 patients with stage I breast cancer, none of the 102 patients with low levels of cyclin E in the tumor had died of breast cancer by five years after diagnosis, whereas all 12 patients with a high level of low-molecular-weight cyclin E had died of breast cancer within that period. In multivariate analysis, a high total cyclin E level or high levels of the low-molecular-weight forms of cyclin E were significantly correlated with poor outcome. The hazard ratio for death from breast cancer for patients with high total cyclin E levels as compared with those with low total cyclin E levels was 13.3--about eight times as high as the hazard ratios associated with other independent clinical and pathological risk factors. Levels of total cyclin E and low-molecular-weight cyclin E in tumor tissue, as measured by Western blot assay, correlate strongly with survival in patients with breast cancer.",cancer
229,MGMT promoter methylation is prognostic but not predictive for outcome to adjuvant PCV chemotherapy in anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors: a report from EORTC Brain Tumor Group Study 26951.,"O6-methylguanine-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation has been shown to predict survival of patients with glioblastomas if temozolomide is added to radiotherapy (RT). It is unknown if MGMT promoter methylation is also predictive to outcome to RT followed by adjuvant procarbazine, lomustine, and vincristine (PCV) chemotherapy in patients with anaplastic oligodendroglial tumors (AOT). In the European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer study 26951, 368 patients with AOT were randomly assigned to either RT alone or to RT followed by adjuvant PCV. From 165 patients of this study, formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue was available for MGMT promoter methylation analysis. This was investigated with methylation specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. In 152 cases, an MGMT result was obtained, in 121 (80%) cases MGMT promoter methylation was observed. Methylation strongly correlated with combined loss of chromosome 1p and 19q loss (P = .00043). In multivariate analysis, MGMT promoter methylation, 1p/19q codeletion, tumor necrosis, and extent of resection were independent prognostic factors. The prognostic significance of MGMT promoter methylation was equally strong in the RT arm and the RT/PCV arm for both progression-free survival and overall survival. In tumors diagnosed at central pathology review as glioblastoma, no prognostic effect of MGMT promoter methylation was observed. In this study, on patients with AOT MGMT promoter methylation was of prognostic significance and did not have predictive significance for outcome to adjuvant PCV chemotherapy. The biologic effect of MGMT promoter methylation or pathogenetic features associated with MGMT promoter methylation may be different for AOT compared with glioblastoma.",cancer

The key features of this noncontact investigation technique like its precise burn depth analysis and the approaches it follows to convert the probed data into a quantitative measure have also been discussed in this article. Recent Advances: The current research developments in THz regime observed in device design technologies (like THz time domain spectrometer, quantum cascade THz lasers, THz single-photon detectors, etc.) and in understanding its unique properties (like nonionizing nature, penetrability through dry dielectrics, etc.) have motivated the research world to realize THz window as a potential candidate for burn detection. Critical Issues: Application of appropriate medical measure for burn injury is primarily subjective to proper estimation of burn depth. Tool modality distinguishing between partial and full-thickness burn contributing toward correct medical care is indeed awaited. Future Directions: The overview of THz imaging as a burn assessment tool as provided in this article will certainly help in further nurturing of this emerging diagnostic technique particularly in improving its detection and accompanied image processing methods so that the minute nuances captured by the THz beam can be correlated with the physiological-anatomical changes in skin structures, caused by burn, for better sensitivity, resolution, and quantitative analysis.",nonCancer
104,Effect of c-kit mutation on prognosis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. Gain-of-function mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of the c-kit gene have been found in several GISTs. In this study, we examined the correlation between the presence of c-kit mutation and prognosis in 124 cases of GIST. DNA samples were extracted from paraffin sections. Exon 11 of the c-kit gene encoding the juxtamembrane domain and exon 17 encoding the kinase domain were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Most GISTs (89%) express the KIT protein, and missense mutations of exon 11 were found in 71 of 124 GISTs (57%). No mutations were detectable in exon 17. These 71 mutation-positive GISTs were larger in size and had more frequently invaded adjacent tissues than did the 53 mutation-negative GISTs. Histologically, the mutation-positive GISTs showed higher mitotic figures and more necrosis and hemorrhage. The patients with mutation-positive GISTs showed more frequent recurrences (P = 0.0005) and higher mortality (P = 0.0001) than did those with mutation-negative GISTs. The c-kit mutation was an independent prognostic factor for overall and cause-specific survival of the patients with GISTs. These results suggest that GISTs may be divided into mutation-positive and -negative subtypes. The prognosis was worse in patients with mutation-positive GISTs than in those with mutation-negative GISTs. Thus, mutation of the c-kit gene may be a good prognostic marker of GISTs.",cancer

2029,Identification of candidate anti-cancer molecular mechanisms of compound kushen injection using functional genomics.,"Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) has been clinically used in China for over 15 years to treat various types of solid tumours. However, because such Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations are complex mixtures of plant secondary metabolites, it is essential to explore their underlying molecular mechanisms in a systematic fashion. We have used the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line as an initial in vitro model to identify CKI induced changes in gene expression. Cells were treated with CKI for 24 and 48 hours at two concentrations (1 and 2 mg/mL total alkaloids), and the effect of CKI on cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured using XTT and Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining assays respectively. Transcriptome data of cells treated with CKI or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for 24 and 48 hours were subsequently acquired using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq technology. In this report we show that CKI inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent fashion. We integrated and applied a series of transcriptome analysis methods, including gene differential expression analysis, pathway over-representation analysis, de novo identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as well as co-expression network reconstruction, to identify candidate anti-cancer molecular mechanisms of CKI. Multiple pathways were perturbed and the cell cycle was identified as the potential primary target pathway of CKI in MCF-7 cells. CKI may also induce apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via a p53 independent mechanism. In addition, we identified novel lncRNAs and showed that many of them might be expressed as a response to CKI treatment.",nonCancer

However, nurses continue to rely on personally created paper-based cognitive artifacts - their ""paper brains"" - to support handoffs, indicating a deficiency in available electronic versions.|The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop a deep understanding of nurses' paper-based cognitive artifacts in the context of a cancer specialty hospital.|After completing 73 hours of hospital unit field observations, 13 medical oncology nurses were purposively sampled, shadowed for a single shift and interviewed using a semi-structured technique. An interpretive descriptive study design guided analysis of the data corpus of field notes, transcribed interviews, images of nurses' paper-based cognitive artifacts, and analytic memos.|Findings suggest nurses' paper brains are personal, dynamic, living objects that undergo a life cycle during each shift and evolve over the course of a nurse's career. The life cycle has four phases: Creation, Application, Reproduction, and Destruction. Evolution in a nurse's individually styled, paper brain is triggered by a change in the nurse's environment that reshapes cognitive needs. If a paper brain no longer provides cognitive support in the new environment, it is modified into (adapted) or abandoned (made extinct) for a different format that will provide the necessary support.|The ""hidden lives"" - the life cycle and evolution - of paper brains have implications for the design of successful electronic tools to support nursing practice, including handoff. Nurses' paper brains provide cognitive support beyond the context of handoff. Information retrieval during handoff is undoubtedly an important function of nurses' paper brains, but tools designed to standardize handoff communication without accounting for cognitive needs during all phases of the paper brain life cycle or the ability to evolve with changes to those cognitive needs will be underutilized.",nonCancer

In the present study, the protective effects and the underlying mechanism of Shenfu injection preconditioning on a rat lung ischemia-reperfusion model was investigated. Shenfu injection is a well-known Chinese traditional medicine, which is composed of Red Radix Ginseng and Radix Aconitum carmichaelii, with ginseng saponin and aconitum alkaloids as the active ingredients. A total of 72 specific pathogen-free, healthy male Wistar rats were randomly divided into control, model and Shenfu injection (10 ml/kg injection prior to injury) groups and were assessed at the following points: Ischemia 45 min; reperfusion 60 min; and reperfusion 120 min. Blood collected from the aorta abdominalis was cryopreserved at -70°C for the analysis of malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity. Lung tissues were divided into three equal sections in order to assess the wet-to-dry (W/D) lung ratio, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression levels, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, alveolar damage, total protein and hematoxylin and eosin staining. The results demonstrated that the lung W/D weight ratio, TNF-α expression levels and SOD activity in the Shenfu group were significantly lower at 120 min reperfusion (P<0.05), as compared with the model group. MPO and MDA activity significantly decreased following reperfusion at 60 and 120 min (P<0.05), as compared with the model group. In addition, the degree of alveolar damage in the Shenfu group was significantly decreased (P<0.05), as compared with the model group. In addition, compared with the model group, the degree of alveolar damage in the Shenfu group was significantly lower (P<0.05); however, no significant changes in total protein were observed. The extent of alveolar structural damage and the proportion of interstitial neutrophils and alveolar and interstitial red blood cells were lower in the Shenfu group, as compared with the model and control groups. Therefore, the results of the present study suggested that Shenfu injection may have protective effects on lung ischemia-reperfusion injury.",nonCancer
818,p53 gene mutation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia is associated with drug resistance and is independent of MDR1/MDR3 gene expression.,"We studied 53 patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and found mutations of the p53 gene in 15%. Patients with p53 gene mutations were found to have an aggressive form of B-CLL disease characterized by advanced Rai stage, rapid lymphocyte doubling time (LDT), and resistance to chemotherapy. While 27 of 29 treated patients (93%) without p53 mutations achieved a partial remission, only one of seven treated patients (14%) with p53 mutations achieved a partial remission (P = .00009). Adjusting for prognostic factors (age, sex, race, and Rai stage), patients with p53 gene mutations had a 13-fold greater risk of death than patients without p53 mutations (P = .013). In addition to examining the clinical relevance of p53 gene mutations in B-CLL, we investigated the possible role of p53 gene regulation in the expression of the multidrug resistance genes MDR1 and MDR3. We quantitated MDR1 and MDR3 mRNA expression by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of both the MDR1 and MDR3 genes was independent of p53 gene mutation or prior drug treatment, and did not predict for clinical response.

Osteopathic practitioners treat patients of all ages: according to the Osteopathic International Alliance's 2012 survey, about one-third of all treated patients are aged between 31 and 50 years and nearly a quarter (23.4%) are pediatric patients, with 8.7% of them being younger than 2 years. In 2013 a systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) in pediatric patients with different underlying disorders, but due to the paucity and low methodological quality of the primary studies the results were inconclusive. The aim of this review is therefore to update the evidence concerning OMT in perinatal and pediatric disorders and to assess its clinical impact. Most published studies favor OMT, but the generally small sample sizes in these studies cannot support ultimate conclusions about the efficacy of osteopathic therapy in pediatric age. In turn, clinical trials of OMT in premature infants might represent an important step in the osteopathic research because they can address both cost-effectiveness issues, and an innovative, multidisciplinary approach to the management of specific pediatric diseases cared for by the same, common health care system. The available studies in neonatal settings provide evidence that OMT is effective in reducing the hospital length of stay of the treated infants, therefore, suggesting that robust cost-effectiveness analyses should be included in the future clinical trials' design to establish new possible OMT-shared strategies within the health care services provided to newborns.",nonCancer

291,An EZH2 polymorphism is associated with clinical outcome in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.,"Despite therapeutic innovations, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) is still characterized by poor prognosis and few molecular markers predict the risk of progression. Polycomb group genes (PcGs) are epigenetic modifiers involved in tumor suppressor gene silencing. PcG member EZH2 mediates gene silencing through histone-H3 lysine-27 methylation. In colorectal cancer (CRC), EZH2 overexpression predicts shorter survival. Recently, four EZH2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have been described. The present study was aimed at evaluating the correlation between EZH2 SNPs and outcome parameters in mCRC patients. DNA was extracted from blood samples of 110 mCRC patients treated with first-line 5-fluorouracil, folinic acid, irinotecan (FOLFIRI) and bevacizumab. Genotyping was carried out by real-time PCR. Genotype was used to predict objective response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). EZH2 messenger RNA levels were evaluated on lymphocytes of a parallel cohort of 50 CRC patients. One allelic variant (rs3757441 C/C versus C/T or T/T) was significantly associated with shorter PFS and OS (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). At multivariate analysis, the same variant resulted an independent predictor of PFS and OS (P < 0.05). The C/C variant was associated with significantly higher EZH2 expression (P < 0.05). An EZH2 SNP may be useful to predict clinical outcome in mCRC patients.",cancer
1755,Investigation of Motor Cortical Plasticity and Corticospinal Tract Diffusion Tensor Imaging in Patients with Parkinsons Disease and Essential Tremor.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET) are characterized with motor dysfunctions. Motor circuit dysfunctions can be complementarily investigated by paired associative stimulation (PAS)-induced long-term potentiation (LTP)-like plasticity and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the corticospinal tract (CST). Three groups of twelve subjects with moderate severity PD, ET with intention tremor and healthy controls (HC) were studied. The primary motor cortex (M1) excitability, measured by motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude and by short-interval and long-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI and LICI) was compared between the three groups before and after PAS. The DTI measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were acquired. PAS effects and DTI data were simultaneously examined between groups. PAS increased MEP amplitude in HC but not in PD and ET. SICI and LICI were significantly reduced after PAS irrespective of groups. No significant differences of the mean FA and MD were found between groups. There was no significant correlation between the PAS effects and the DTI measures. Findings suggest that both PD and ET with intention tremor have impairment of the associative LTP-like corticospinal excitability change in M1. The microstructure of the CST is not relevant to the deficiency of M1 associative plasticity in PD and ET.",nonCancer
1383,Long-Term Course of Borderline Personality Disorder.,"Information concerning the longitudinal course of Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) derives mainly from (a) long-term (10 to 25 year) retrospective follow-up studies, primarily those conducted during the 1980s/1990s, (b) brief (1 to 3 year) follow-up studies of recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of several different treatment approaches, and (c) prospective follow-up studies. The patients contacted in the retrospective studies had been treated mostly by psychoanalytically informed approaches or supportive. Though there was a significant suicide rate of 3 to 9%, about two-thirds of the BPD patients eventually achieved a global assessment score in the 60s or beyond. BPD represents a heterogeneous group of patients, whose outcome is a function of many variables, including personality traits (paranoid and narcissistic conducing to less favorable outcomes), cultural differences, socio-economic level, intelligence level, gender, and age of onset. The RCT studies focused on amelioration of the symptom components of BPD, especially tendencies to self-injury and suicide. The currently favored treatment methods showed in a large percentage of patients, a lessening of these self-destructive behaviors after a year or two of treatment. The time spans were too brief to allow assessment of improvement in key life areas (attainment of self-sufficiency in work, widening of the circle of friends, and success in forming satisfactory intimate partnerships). The prospective studies are based on reassessments at regular intervals of BPD patients and a control group with other personality disorders. Over the past 16 years the BPD patients, compared with controls, were slower to achieve remission, and more apt to show cognitive peculiarities initially-though they showed appreciable improvement over time. The ""recovered"" BPD patients, compared with the non-recovered patients, showed twice the likelihood of achieving a successful intimate relationship. At 16 years the McLean study has shown results similar (though scientifically more precise) to those of the old retrospective studies. The studies do not demonstrate the efficacy of one or another treatment approach, since, in long-term follow-up, psychotherapy, albeit essential, becomes one of a myriad of influences affecting outcome. There is general agreement that BPD patients who have experienced severe early trauma (including incest) are at greater risk for a poor outcome-as are those with prominent antisocial traits (more common in BPD males). The personality trait of agreeableness was associated with greater likelihood of favorable outcome.",nonCancer
2393,Trends in CT Request and Related Outcomes in a Pediatric Emergency Department.,"To study and to establish the overall trends of computed tomography (CT) use and associated outcomes in the pediatric emergency department (PED) at Royal Hospital, Oman, from 2010 to 2014.|The hospital electronic medical record was retrospectively searched to find children (from birth to 12 years old) who had visited the PED and the number of CT requests between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2014. The types of CT examinations ordered were analyzed according to anatomical location and were as follows; head, abdomen/pelvis, chest, cervical spine/neck, and others.|There were a total of 67 244 PED visits during the study period, 569 of which received 642 CT scans. There was a remarkable rise in CT uses per 1000 visits from 7 in 2010 to 12 in 2014. There was a 56% hike in CT requests from 87 in 2010 to 175 in 2014 while the number of pediatric emergency visits rose by about 28% from 11 721 to 15 052. Although head CT scans were the most common, cervical spine CT scans had the highest rate of increase (600%) followed by the chest (112%), head (54%) and abdomen (13%). There were no significant changes in other CT scan requests. The cost of CT scans increased from $18 096 to $36 400 during the study period, which increased the average PED cost by about $2 per visit. The average time between a CT being requested and then performed was 1.24 hours.|CT use in the pediatric emergency department has risen significantly at a rate that markedly exceeds the growth of emergency visits. This is associated with an increase in PED costs and longer waiting times.",nonCancer
231,Whole transcriptome sequencing reveals recurrent NOTCH1 mutations in mantle cell lymphoma.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), an aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, is characterized by the hallmark translocation t(11;14)(q13;q32) and the resulting overexpression of cyclin D1 (CCND1). Our current knowledge of this disease encompasses frequent secondary cytogenetic aberrations and the recurrent mutation of a handful of genes, such as TP53, ATM, and CCND1. However, these findings insufficiently explain the biologic underpinnings of MCL. Here, we performed whole transcriptome sequencing on a discovery cohort of 18 primary tissue MCL samples and 2 cell lines. We found recurrent mutations in NOTCH1, a finding that we confirmed in an extension cohort of 108 clinical samples and 8 cell lines. In total, 12% of clinical samples and 20% of cell lines harbored somatic NOTCH1 coding sequence mutations that clustered in the PEST domain and predominantly consisted of truncating mutations or small frame-shifting indels. NOTCH1 mutations were associated with poor overall survival (P = .003). Furthermore, we showed that inhibition of the NOTCH pathway reduced proliferation and induced apoptosis in 2 MCL cell lines. In summary, we have identified recurrent NOTCH1 mutations that provide the preclinical rationale for therapeutic inhibition of the NOTCH pathway in a subset of patients with MCL.",cancer
1411,Interplay of atomic randomness and Kondo effect in disordered metallic conductor La2NiSi3.,"A polycrystalline sample of La2NiSi3 was investigated by means of heat capacity, magnetic susceptibility, magnetization, electrical resistivity and magnetoresistivity measurements. The compound was basically characterized as a Pauli paramagnet with metallic-like electrical conductivity, notably reduced in magnitude and weakly temperature dependent, as is usually observed for atomically disordered systems. Furthermore, the experimental data revealed the presence of a small amount of paramagnetic impurities. As a result, the low-temperature electrical resistivity in La2NiSi3 was found to be governed by both quantum corrections due to electron-electron interactions ([Formula: see text] contribution) and spin-flip Kondo scattering ([Formula: see text] contribution). The presence of paramagnetic impurities led to an increase in s-electron spin splitting due to the s-d interactions, manifested by a B (1/2) dependence of the magnetoresistivity, anomalously observed in the present study for thermal energy being larger than the Zeeman splitting energy [Formula: see text].",nonCancer
1826,A recyclable naturally derived magnetic pyrrhotite for elemental mercury recovery from the flue gas.,"Magnetic pyrrhotite, which was derived from the thermal treatment of natural pyrite, was developed as a recyclable sorbent to recover elemental mercury (Hg0) from the flue gas as a co-benefit of the wet electrostatic precipitators (WESP). The performance of naturally derived pyrrhotite for Hg0 capture from the flue gas was much better than those of other reported magnetic sorbents for example Mn-Fe spinel and Mn-Fe-Ti spinel. The rate of pyrrhotite for gaseous Hg0 capture at 60 oC was 0.28 g g min-1 and its capacity was 0.22 mg g-1 with the breakthrough threshold of 4%. After the magnetic separation from the mixture collected by the WESP, the spent pyrrhotite can be thermally regenerated for the recycle. The experiment of 5 cycles of Hg0 capture and regeneration demonstrated that both the adsorption efficiency and the magnetization were not degraded notably. Meanwhile, the ultra-low concentration of gaseous Hg0 in the flue gas was concentrated to high concentrations of gaseous Hg0 and Hg2+ during the regeneration process, which facilitated the centralized control of mercury pollution. Therefore, the control of Hg0 emission from coal-fired plants by the recyclable pyrrhotite was cost-effective and did not have the secondary pollution.",nonCancer
273,Specific p53 mutations predict poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"In this study, we focused on p53 mutations in specific regions, including DNA-binding surface regions, to clarify the correlation between mutations within the specific regions of p53 and clinical outcomes of patients with oral cancers. We analyzed p53 mutations in 121 fresh primary oral squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism or a yeast functional assay. p53 mutations were detected in 51/121 (42%) cases. Mutation of p53 was not associated with any clinicopathological parameters; however, tumors containing specific p53 mutations, e.g. DNA-binding surface regions (L2, L3 and the LSH motif) and conserved regions (II-V), had significantly poorer prognoses than tumors with mutations outside of those regions. Moreover, locoregional failure, lymph node metastasis and the occurrence of subsequent distant metastasis were also significantly associated with mutations within DNA-binding surface regions. These data indicate that specific mutations of p53 could be important prognostic factors in oral SCCs.",cancer
241,"KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and PTEN mutations: implications for targeted therapies in metastatic colorectal cancer.","The discovery of mutant KRAS as a predictor of resistance to epidermal growth-factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies brought a major change in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer. This seminal finding also highlighted our sparse knowledge about key signalling pathways in colorectal tumours. Drugs that inhibit oncogenic alterations such as phospho-MAP2K (also called MEK), phospho-AKT, and mutant B-RAF seem promising as single treatment or when given with EGFR inhibitors. However, our understanding of the precise role these potential drug targets have in colorectal tumours, and the oncogenic dependence that tumours might have on these components, has not progressed at the same rate. As a result, patient selection and prediction of treatment effects remain problematic. We review the role of mutations in genes other than KRAS on the efficacy of anti-EGFR therapy, and discuss strategies to target these oncogenic alterations alone or in combination with receptor tyrosine-kinase inhibition.",cancer
1006,Fusion of the EWS and CHOP genes in myxoid liposarcoma.,"The translocation t(12;16)(q13;p11), which cytogenetically characterizes myxoid liposarcomas (MLS), results in a fusion of the CHOP gene in 12q13 and the FUS gene in 16p11, creating a chimeric FUS/CHOP gene. We have identified two cases of MLS with translocations giving rise to recombination between 12q13 and 22q12. The result was a fusion of the N-terminal part of the EWS gene in 22q12, involved in a number of mesenchymal tumor types, with the CHOP gene and the creation of an EWS/CHOP chimeric gene. The presence of the EWS/CHOP chimeric gene in MLS shows that (i) the N-terminal part of FUS may be replaced by the N-terminal part of EWS in a CHOP fusion oncoprotein (ii) the two N-terminal parts, when fused to certain transcription factors, have a common or very similar oncogenic potential and (iii) the tumorigenic process in MLS and the morphogenetically distinctly different EWS-associated tumor types may be related.",cancer
645,Association of matrix metalloproteinase 2 plasma level with response and survival in patients treated with bevacizumab for recurrent high-grade glioma.,"A predictive marker of bevacizumab activity is an unmet medical need. We evaluated the predictive value of selected circulating prebiomarkers involved in neoangiogenesis and invasion on patient outcome in recurrent high-grade glioma treated with bevacizumab. Analyzed in plasma were a set of 11 prebiomakers of interest (vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGF]; VEGF receptor 2; basic fibroblast growth factor; stromal cell derived factor 1; placenta growth factor; urokinase-type plasminogen activator; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; matrix metalloproteinases 2, 7, and 9; and adrenomedulline), using ELISA, at baseline and 2 weeks after bevacizumab initiation in a prospective cohort of 26 patients (Cohort 1). Correlations were validated in a separate retrospective cohort (Cohort 2; n = 50) and tested in cohort patients treated with cytotoxic agents without bevacizumab (Cohort 3; n = 34). Dosages were correlated to objective response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). In Cohort 1, high MMP2 baseline level was associated with a probability of objective response of 83.3% versus 15.4% for low MMP2 level (P = .001). In multivariate analysis, baseline level of MMP2 correlated with PFS (hazard ratio, 3.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.46-10.52; P = .007) and OS (hazard ratio, 4.62; 95% CI: 1.58-13.53; P = .005), as decrease of VEGF (P = .038 for PFS and P = .013 for OS) and MMP9 (P = .016 for PFS and P = .025 for OS). In Cohort 2, MMP2, but not MMP9, confirmed its predictive significance. In Cohort 3, no association was found between MMP2, MMP9, and outcome. In patients with recurrent high-grade glioma treated with bevacizumab, but not with cytotoxic agent, high MMP2 plasma levels are associated with prolonged tumor control and survival. MMP2 should be tested in randomized clinical trials that evaluate bevacizumab efficacy, and its biological role reassessed.",cancer
988,Detection of t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation of Ewing's sarcoma in paraffin embedded tissue by nested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.,"Ewing's sarcoma is a poorly characterized malignant tumor with a relatively uniform histologic appearance, made up of densely packed small cells with round to oval nuclei, without distinct cell borders and without any structural differentiation. Often the diagnosis has to be made by exclusion. Recently, it has been made possible to identify characteristic chromosomal rearrangements associated with certain solid tumors. More than 85% of Ewing's sarcoma and peripheral neuroectodermal tumor present a specific t(11;22)(q24;q12) balanced translocation, resulting in the production of a novel chimerical EWS/FLI-1 message. Using oligonucleotide primers derived from EWS and FLI-1 complementary DNAs, we were able to use reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) as a diagnostic tool. The described nested RT-PCR method as another supportive diagnostic method enables pathologists to differentiate small blue cell tumors not only to make correct diagnosis but also to investigate retrospective archival tumor samples, using formalin fixed paraffin embedded tissue as a source of RNA.",cancer
194,Frequent mutation of histone-modifying genes in non-Hodgkin lymphoma.,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are the two most common non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs). Here we sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from 13 DLBCL cases and one FL case to identify genes with mutations in B-cell NHL. We analysed RNA-seq data from these and another 113 NHLs to identify genes with candidate mutations, and then re-sequenced tumour and matched normal DNA from these cases to confirm 109 genes with multiple somatic mutations. Genes with roles in histone modification were frequent targets of somatic mutation. For example, 32% of DLBCL and 89% of FL cases had somatic mutations in MLL2, which encodes a histone methyltransferase, and 11.4% and 13.4% of DLBCL and FL cases, respectively, had mutations in MEF2B, a calcium-regulated gene that cooperates with CREBBP and EP300 in acetylating histones. Our analysis suggests a previously unappreciated disruption of chromatin biology in lymphomagenesis.",cancer
191,"VHL mutations and their correlation with tumour cell proliferation, microvessel density, and patient prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.","Mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) gene are considered critical for the initiation of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. The VHL protein is involved in regulation of the cell cycle and neo-vascularization. In this study, the association of VHL mutations with tumour cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and clinical outcome was analysed in 113 clear cell renal cell carcinomas. The degree of angiogenesis and tumour cell proliferation was immunohistochemically determined by counting microvessels (microvessel density, anti-CD34 antibody) and cells with proliferating activity (Ki-67 labelling index, MIB-1 antibody). Forty-eight different VHL sequence alterations were found in 38 of 113 patients (34%) by direct sequencing. Nineteen VHL mutations were frameshifts and nonsense mutations, predicted to change the open reading frame of VHL. These 'loss-of-function' mutations correlated with worse prognosis in univariate analysis (p=0.02). Tumour grade, stage, microvessel density, and tumour cell proliferation were not associated with VHL alterations. These findings may indicate that 'loss-of-function' VHL mutations are involved in the progression of a clear cell renal cell carcinoma subset, whereas regulation of angiogenesis and proliferation of renal carcinoma in vivo is apparently not directly influenced by VHL alterations.",cancer
1029,Germline mutation profile of the VHL gene in von Hippel-Lindau disease and in sporadic hemangioblastoma.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited disorder predisposing those afflicted to hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system and the retina, renal cell carcinomas, pheochromocytomas, and pancreatic tumors. The disease has been associated with mutations of the VHL gene. The screening of 92 unrelated patients with VHL disease for point mutations in this gene revealed 61 DNA variants. In addition, a search for EcoR1 rearrangements revealed germline anomalies in 5 patients. The 61 variants could be subdivided in 20 mutations predicted to alter the open reading frame (8 nonsense mutations, 8 frame shift mutations, and 4 mutations in consensus splicing sites) and 43 DNA sequence variants of a priori unknown biological consequence (4 in-frame insertions or deletions, 36 missense mutations, and 3 apparently silent variations). The 3' end of the coding sequence of the VHL gene, which encodes the Elongin binding domain was the site of 5 of 20 truncating mutations (25%) and of 18 of 41 DNA variants (44%) causing uncertain functional impairment. A similar screening in 18 patients with sporadic hemangioblastoma revealed 2 missense DNA variants. In order to corroborate this latter observation, a systematic screening for germline alteration of the VHL gene might be performed in a larger series of sporadic hemangioblastoma. If this preliminary result is confirmed, more than 10% of sporadic hemangioblastoma might be related to a mild VHL disease, thus a follow-up program similar to that recommended in cases of VHL disease should probably be discussed in the corresponding families.",cancer

490,High expression of TIMP-1 in human breast cancer tissues is a predictive of resistance to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.,"For breast cancer patients with lymph node metastasis, paclitaxel is the first-line chemotherapy drug. Clinical studies showed that some patients with breast cancer were insensitive to paclitaxel, which led to chemotherapy failure. Today, no validated markers exist for the prediction of chemotherapy sensitivity in this patient group. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1) has been shown to protect against apoptosis. Epidemiological studies have also associated elevated tumor tissue TIMP-1 levels with a poor response to cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-fluorouracil and anthracycline-based chemotherapy. Additionally, our previous study proved that TIMP-1 significantly decreased the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by enhancing degradation of cyclin B1. These data imply that TIMP-1 may be a useful predictive biomarker for chemotherapy resistance. In this retrospective study, we investigated the association between expression levels of TIMP-1 protein in the primary tumor and objective response to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy in 99 patients with breast cancer. With Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, the patients with high TIMP-1 levels were found to have significantly worse 5-year DFS (71.1 %) than the patients with low levels (88.5 %; P = 0.020). Similarly, the patients with high TIMP-1 levels had significantly worse 5-year OS (78.9 %) than patients with low levels (96.7 %; P = 0.004). In Cox's univariate and multivariate analyses, TIMP-1 was prognostic for both DFS and OS. Our data showed that elevated tumor tissue TIMP-1 levels were significantly associated with a poor response to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy, and TIMP-1 might be a potential biomarker for predicting response of breast cancer patients to paclitaxel-based chemotherapy.",cancer

Among them, Ti2Si is ferromagnetic metal with a magnetic moment of 1.37 μB/cell, while TiSi2 is an ideal catalyst for hydrogen evolution reaction with a nearly zero free energy of hydrogen adsorption. More importantly, electron-phonon coupling calculations suggest that TiSi4 is a robust 2D phonon-mediated superconductor with a transition temperature of 5.8 K and the transition temperature can be enhanced up to 11.7 K under a suitable external strain.

We tested the efficiency of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in selected patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit mutations or amplifications. Forty-three patients with metastatic melanoma harboring c-Kit aberrations were enrolled on this phase II trial. Each patient received a continuous dose of imatinib 400 mg/d unless intolerable toxicities or disease progression occurred. Fifteen patients who experienced progression of disease were allowed to escalate the dose to 800 mg/d. Forty-three patients were eligible for evaluation, and the median follow-up time was 12.0 months. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 3.5 months, and the 6-month PFS rate was 36.6%. Rate of total disease control was 53.5%: 10 patients (23.3%; 95% CI, 10.2% to 36.4%) and 13 patients (30.2%; 95% CI, 16.0% to 44.4%) achieved partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD), respectively. Eighteen patients (41.9%) demonstrated regression of tumor mass. Notably, nine of the 10 PRs were observed in patients with mutations in exons 11 or 13. The 1-year overall survival (OS) rate was 51.0%. The median PFS and OS times for patients who had PR or SD versus disease progression were 9.0 months versus 1.5 months (P < .001) and 15.0 months versus 9.0 months (P = .036), respectively. Imatinib 400 mg/d was well tolerated, and only one of the 15 patients who received dose escalation to 800 mg/d achieved SD. Imatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with metastatic melanoma harboring genetic c-Kit aberrations, with an overall response rate of 23.3%.

239,Highly frequent PIK3CA amplification is associated with poor prognosis in gastric cancer.,"The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway plays a fundamental role in cell proliferation and survival in human tumorigenesis, including gastric cancer. PIK3CA mutations and amplification are two major causes of overactivation of this pathway in human cancers. However, until this work, there was no sound investigation on the association of PIK3CA mutations and amplification with clinical outcome in gastric cancer, particularly the latter. Using direct sequencing and real-time quantitative PCR, we examined PIK3CA mutations and amplification, and their association with clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome of gastric cancer patients. PIK3CA mutations and amplification were found in 8/113 (7.1%) and 88/131 (67%) gastric cancer patients, respectively. PIK3CA amplification was closely associated with increased phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt) level. No relationship was found between PIK3CA mutations and clinicopathological characteristics and clinical outcome in gastric cancer. PIK3CA amplification was significantly positively associated with cancer-related death. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that the patients with PIK3CA amplification had significantly shorter survival times than the patients without PIK3CA amplification. Our data showed that PIK3CA mutations were not common, but its amplification was very common in gastric cancer and may be a major mechanism in activating the PI3K/Akt pathway in gastric cancer. Importantly, Kaplan-Meier survival curves revealed that PIK3CA amplification was significantly positively associated with poor survival of gastric cancer patients. Collectively, the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway may be an effective therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",cancer
749,A diverse array of cancer-associated MTOR mutations are hyperactivating and can predict rapamycin sensitivity.,"Genes encoding components of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling axis are frequently mutated in cancer, but few mutations have been characterized in MTOR, the gene encoding the mTOR kinase. Using publicly available tumor genome sequencing data, we generated a comprehensive catalog of mTOR pathway mutations in cancer, identifying 33 MTOR mutations that confer pathway hyperactivation. The mutations cluster in six distinct regions in the C-terminal half of mTOR and occur in multiple cancer types, with one cluster particularly prominent in kidney cancer. The activating mutations do not affect mTOR complex assembly, but a subset reduces binding to the mTOR inhibitor DEPTOR. mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cells expressing various activating mutations remains sensitive to pharmacologic mTOR inhibition, but is partially resistant to nutrient deprivation.

Molecular profiling of the NCI-60 cancer cell lines using five different microarray platforms showed strong negative correlations of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) expression and DNA copy number with sensitivity to l-ASP in the leukemia and ovarian cancer cell subsets. To assess whether the ovarian relationship is causal, we used RNA interference to silence ASNS in three ovarian lines and observed 4- to 5-fold potentiation of sensitivity to l-ASP with two of the lines. For OVCAR-8, the line that expresses the least ASNS, the potentiation was >500-fold. Significantly, that potentiation was >700-fold in the multidrug-resistant derivative OVCAR-8/ADR, showing that the causal relationship between ASNS expression and l-ASP activity survives development of classical multidrug resistance. Tissue microarrays confirmed low ASNS expression in a subset of clinical ovarian cancers as well as other tumor types. Overall, this pharmacogenomic/pharmacoproteomic study suggests the use of l-ASP for treatment of a subset of ovarian cancers (and perhaps other tumor types), with ASNS as a biomarker for patient selection.",cancer
37,Anti-tumor activity of motesanib in a medullary thyroid cancer model.,"Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is frequently associated with mutations in the tyrosine kinase Ret and with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2). Motesanib is an investigational, orally administered small molecule antagonist of VEGFR1, 2, and 3; platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR); Kit; and possibly Ret. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of motesanib on wildtype and mutant Ret activity in vitro and on tumor xenograft growth in a mouse model of MTC. In cellular phosphorylation assays, motesanib inhibited the activity of wild-type Ret (IC(50)=66 nM), while it had limited activity against mutant Ret C634W (IC(50)=1100 nM) or Ret M918T (IC(50)>2500 nM). In vivo, motesanib significantly inhibited the growth of TT tumor cell xenografts (expressing Ret C634W) and significantly reduced tumor blood vessel area and tumor cell proliferation, compared with control. Treatment with motesanib resulted in substantial inhibition of Ret tyrosine phosphorylation in TT xenografts and, at comparable doses, in equivalent inhibition of VEGFR2 phosphorylation in both TT xenografts and in mouse lung tissue. The results of this study demonstrate that motesanib inhibited thyroid tumor xenograft growth predominantly through inhibition of angiogenesis and possibly via a direct inhibition of VEGFR2 and Ret expressed on tumor cells. These data suggest that targeting angiogenesis pathways and specifically the VEGF pathway may represent a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of MTC.",cancer
2052,Cation Interactions and Membrane Potential Induce Conformational Changes in NaPi-IIb.,"Voltage-dependence of Na(+)-coupled phosphate cotransporters of the SLC34 family arises from displacement of charges intrinsic to the protein and the binding/release of one Na(+) ion in response to changes in the transmembrane electric field. Candidate coordination residues for the cation at the Na1 site were previously predicted by structural modeling using the x-ray structure of dicarboxylate transporter VcINDY as template and confirmed by functional studies. Mutations at Na1 resulted in altered steady-state and presteady-state characteristics that should be mirrored in the conformational changes induced by membrane potential changes. To test this hypothesis by functional analysis, double mutants of the flounder SLC34A2 protein were constructed that contain one of the Na1-site perturbing mutations together with a substituted cysteine for fluorophore labeling, as expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The locations of the mutations were mapped onto a homology model of the flounder protein. The effects of the mutagenesis were characterized by steady-state, presteady-state, and fluorometric assays. Changes in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) in response to membrane potential steps were resolved at three previously identified positions. These fluorescence data corroborated the altered presteady-state kinetics upon perturbation of Na1, and furthermore indicated concomitant changes in the microenvironment of the respective fluorophores, as evidenced by changes in the voltage dependence and time course of ΔF. Moreover, iodide quenching experiments indicated that the aqueous nature of the fluorophore microenvironment depended on the membrane potential. These findings provide compelling evidence that membrane potential and cation interactions induce significant large-scale structural rearrangements of the protein.",nonCancer
380,The relation of EGFR expression by immunohistochemical staining and clinical response of combination treatment of nimotuzumab and chemotherapy in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"The esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant pathological type and accounts for more than 80 % of esophageal cancer in China. The successful use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) treatment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma provides the rationale for introducing anti-EGFR targeting treatment in ESCC. One of our prospective phase II clinical trials analyzed the efficacy of nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR agent, combined with chemotherapy (paclitaxel and cisplatin) to treat unresectable ESCC. We analyzed the correlation of the clinical response with EGFR expression by immunohistochemical staining (IHC). Totally 55 tumor samples were analyzed. 18/55 (32.7 %) cases were with high EGFR expression while the other 37/55 (67.3 %) cases were with low to moderate EGFR expression. The expression of EGFR was not related to gender, age, tumor location, tumor differentiation and clinical stage of disease. The objective response rate (ORR) in high EGFR expression group was 55.6 % (10/18) while that in low to moderate EGFR expression group was 54.1 % (20/37) (P = 0.57). Both the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in high EGFR expression group were much shorter than those in low to moderate EGFR expression group (PFS: 5.8 ± 0.5 vs. 11.0 ± 2.8 months, P = 0.007; OS: 9.7 ± 0.5 vs. 21.5 ± 1.5 months, P = 0.03). The results showed that over-expression of EGFR was related to poor survival of ESCC. The over-expression of EGFR by IHC might not be an ideal predictive biomarker of nimotuzumab treatment. Other EGFR pathway-associated molecules should be analyzed in further studies.",cancer
1124,"Reduction of serum IGF-I levels in patients affected with Monoclonal Gammopathies of undetermined significance or Multiple Myeloma. Comparison with bFGF, VEGF and K-ras gene mutation.","Serum levels of IGF-I in patients affected with multiple myeloma (MM) have been scarcely studied. The present study is aimed to explore this point comparing 55 healthy subjects, 71 monoclonal gammopaties of uncertain significance (MGUS) and 77 overt MM patients. In the same subjects, basic FGF and VEGF, have been detected. All three mediators were analyzed in function of K-ras mutation and melphalan response. Concerning IGF-I, two representative monitoring examples have also been added. Cytokine determinations were performed by commercially available ELISA kits, while K12-ras mutation was investigated on genomic DNA isolated from bone marrow cell specimens by RFLP-PCR assay. Significant reductions of IGF-I levels were observed in MGUS and MM as compared with healthy controls. In addition, MM subjects showed significantly decreased serum IGF-I levels than MGUS. Conversely, increasing levels were observed for bFGF and VEGF, molecules significantly correlated. A multivariate analysis corrected for age and gender confirmed the significant difference only for IGF-I values (P = 0.01). K12-ras mutation was significantly associated with malignancy, response to therapy and with significantly increased serum bFGF levels. IGF-I reduction in the transition: Controls-->MGUS-->MM and changes observed over time suggest that IGF-I should be furtherly studied in future clinical trials as a possible monitoring marker for MM.",cancer
1582,Multiple Attentional Sets while Monitoring Rapid Serial Visual Presentations.,"The present study examined the flexibility of attentional sets. Previous studies have shown that the visual system can be adaptively configured to control attention suitable for a behavioural goal. Seven experiments were conducted to test whether observers are able to establish multiple attentional sets to concurrently monitor two different spatial locations. Observers identified a target letter in red or cyan among nontarget letters of other heterogeneous colours presented as a rapid serial visual stream during a feature search. A distractor display consisted of items in the periphery such that one was either the same colour as the target of the current trial, the other potential target colour, or an irrelevant colour that could never be the target. They identified an odd-ball colour letter among homogenous colours during a singleton search. The results revealed that observers maintained multiple attentional sets for detecting two singletons or for targets involving two (or three) features. However, they were unable to maintain a mixture of sets. Moreover, exposure to a distractor containing feature that corresponded to a feature of the target in the current trial was advantageous for target identification. The presence or absence of this set-specific capture depended on top-down knowledge and did not occur automatically in the singleton-detection stream. These results demonstrate a limitation in the flexibility of attentional sets. Although two singleton detections were possible, multiple attentional templates for a more complex attentional set could not be maintained concurrently when monitoring multiple rapid serial visual presentations.",nonCancer
387,A synthetic lethal interaction between K-Ras oncogenes and Cdk4 unveils a therapeutic strategy for non-small cell lung carcinoma.,"We have unveiled a synthetic lethal interaction between K-Ras oncogenes and Cdk4 in a mouse tumor model that closely recapitulates human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Ablation of Cdk4, but not Cdk2 or Cdk6, induces an immediate senescence response only in lung cells that express an endogenous K-Ras oncogene. No such response occurs in lungs expressing a single Cdk4 allele or in other K-Ras-expressing tissues. More importantly, targeting Cdk4 alleles in advanced tumors detectable by computed tomography scanning also induces senescence and prevents tumor progression. These observations suggest that robust and selective pharmacological inhibition of Cdk4 may provide therapeutic benefit for NSCLC patients carrying K-RAS oncogenes.",cancer
2205,Diagnostic and prognostic value of molecular and serological investigation of human parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy.,"To define diagnostic and prognostic markers of parvovirus B19 (B19V) fetal infection, two groups were investigated: 1) pregnant women with specific symptoms or contacts with symptomatic households (n=37); 2) mothers with pathological ultrasound findings and the relevant fetus at the time of prenatal diagnosis (n=16). In the first group, diagnosis of B19V infection was achieved using IgM detection in 29/37 (78.3%) of patients, while B19V DNA was detected in 36/37 (97.3%) of infected women. In the second group, intrauterine infection was investigated by amniocentesis (n=5), cordocentesis (n=3) or both (n=5). Median B19V DNA load in amniotic fluid was 8.2x107 copies/ml and in fetal blood was 2x109 copies/ml. Maternal blood was positive for B19V DNA (median 3.8x104 copies/ml) in 14/16 (87.5%) women examined. At time of fetal US investigation, all mothers were B19V IgG positive and B19V IgM were detected in 10/16 (62.5%), while fetal B19V IgG and IgM were detected in 1/8 (12.5%) and 5/8 (62.5%), respectively. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all B19V maternal and fetal strains belonged to genotype 1A. Diagnosis of maternal, fetal and neonatal B19V infection should be based on both IgM and DNA detection. Prognostic markers of congenital B19V infection need to be defined.",nonCancer
864,"The cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone as first-line treatment of oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer (PALOMA-1/TRIO-18): a randomised phase 2 study.","Palbociclib (PD-0332991) is an oral, small-molecule inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) 4 and 6 with preclinical evidence of growth-inhibitory activity in oestrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells and synergy with anti-oestrogens. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of palbociclib in combination with letrozole as first-line treatment of patients with advanced, oestrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer. In this open-label, randomised phase 2 study, postmenopausal women with advanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer who had not received any systemic treatment for their advanced disease were eligible to participate. Patients were enrolled in two separate cohorts that accrued sequentially: in cohort 1, patients were enrolled on the basis of their oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative biomarker status alone, whereas in cohort 2 they were also required to have cancers with amplification of cyclin D1 (CCND1), loss of p16 (INK4A or CDKN2A), or both. In both cohorts, patients were randomly assigned 1:1 via an interactive web-based randomisation system, stratified by disease site and disease-free interval, to receive continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily or continuous oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral palbociclib 125 mg, given once daily for 3 weeks followed by 1 week off over 28-day cycles. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population. Accrual to cohort 2 was stopped after an unplanned interim analysis of cohort 1 and the statistical analysis plan for the primary endpoint was amended to a combined analysis of cohorts 1 and 2 (instead of cohort 2 alone). The study is ongoing but closed to accrual; these are the results of the final analysis of progression-free survival. The study is registered with the ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00721409. Between Dec 22, 2009, and May 12, 2012, we randomly assigned 165 patients, 84 to palbociclib plus letrozole and 81 to letrozole alone. At the time of the final analysis for progression-free survival (median follow-up 29.6 months [95% CI 27.9-36.0] for the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 27.9 months [25.5-31.1] for the letrozole group), 41 progression-free survival events had occurred in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and 59 in the letrozole group. Median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 5.7-12.6) for the letrozole group and 20.2 months (13.8-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.488, 95% CI 0.319-0.748; one-sided p=0.0004). In cohort 1 (n=66), median progression-free survival was 5.7 months (2.6-10.5) for the letrozole group and 26.1 months (11.2-not estimable) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.299, 0.156-0.572; one-sided p<0.0001); in cohort 2 (n=99), median progression-free survival was 11.1 months (7.1-16.4) for the letrozole group and 18.1 months (13.1-27.5) for the palbociclib plus letrozole group (HR 0.508, 0.303-0.853; one-sided p=0.0046). Grade 3-4 neutropenia was reported in 45 (54%) of 83 patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group versus one (1%) of 77 patients in the letrozole group, leucopenia in 16 (19%) versus none, and fatigue in four (4%) versus one (1%). Serious adverse events that occurred in more than one patient in the palbociclib plus letrozole group were pulmonary embolism (three [4%] patients), back pain (two [2%]), and diarrhoea (two [2%]). No cases of febrile neutropenia or neutropenia-related infections were reported during the study. 11 (13%) patients in the palbociclib plus letrozole group and two (2%) in the letrozole group discontinued the study because of adverse events. The addition of palbociclib to letrozole in this phase 2 study significantly improved progression-free survival in women with advanced oestrogen receptor-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. A phase 3 trial is currently underway. Pfizer.",cancer
190,TET2 mutation is an unfavorable prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics.,"The studies concerning clinical implications of TET2 mutation in patients with primary acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are scarce. We analyzed TET2 mutation in 486 adult patients with primary AML. TET2 mutation occurred in 13.2% of our patients and was closely associated with older age, higher white blood cell and blast counts, lower platelet numbers, normal karyotype, intermediate-risk cytogenetics, isolated trisomy 8, NPM1 mutation, and ASXL1 mutation but mutually exclusive with IDH mutation. TET2 mutation is an unfavorable prognostic factor in patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, and its negative impact was further enhanced when the mutation was combined with FLT3-ITD, NPM1-wild, or unfavorable genotypes (other than NPM1(+)/FLT3-ITD(-) or CEBPA(+)). A scoring system integrating TET2 mutation with FLT3-ITD, NPM1, and CEBPA mutations could well separate AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics into 4 groups with different prognoses (P < .0001). Sequential analysis revealed that TET2 mutation detected at diagnosis was frequently lost at relapse; rarely, the mutation was acquired at relapse in those without TET2 mutation at diagnosis. In conclusion, TET2 mutation is associated with poor prognosis in AML patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics, especially when it is combined with other adverse molecular markers. TET2 mutation appeared to be unstable during disease evolution.",cancer
1869,The Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Blueberries in an Animal Model of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stressor-related disorder that results in a prolonged stress response. It is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus (HC). The only approved therapy for PTSD is selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), but their efficacy is marginal. Recently, we demonstrated that over-production of norepinephrine (NE) as the possible reason for the lack of efficacy of SSRIs. Hence, there is a need for novel therapeutic approaches for the treatment of PTSD. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory role of blueberries in modulating inflammatory markers and neurotransmitter levels in PTSD. Rats were fed either a blueberry enriched (2%) or a control diet. Rats were exposed to cats for one hour on days 1 and 11 of a 31-day schedule to simulate traumatic conditions. The rats were also subjected to psychosocial stress via daily cage cohort changes. At the end of the study, the rats were euthanized and the PFC and HC were isolated. Monoamines were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), gene and protein expression levels of inflammatory cytokines were also measured. In our PTSD model, NE levels were increased and 5-HT levels were decreased when compared to control. In contrast, a blueberry enriched diet increased 5-HT without affecting NE levels. The rate limiting enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase and tryptophan hydroxylase were also studied and they confirmed our findings. The enhanced levels free radicals, gene and protein expression of inflammatory cytokines seen in the PTSD group were normalized with a blueberry enriched diet. Decreased anxiety in this group was shown by improved performance on the elevated plus-maze. These findings indicate blueberries can attenuate oxidative stress and inflammation and restore neurotransmitter imbalances in a rat model of PTSD.",nonCancer
2364,Underweight status predicts a poor prognosis in elderly patients with colorectal cancer.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of underweight status on the survival of elderly patients undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 113 patients aged ≥75 years who underwent curative surgery for CRC were included. In addition to standard perioperative variables, body mass index (BMI) was assessed. The patients were categorized as underweight (BMI<18.5 kg/m(2)) or non-underweight (BMI≥18.5 kg/m(2)). The 3-year overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS) were analyzed. Of the 113 patients, 24 (21%) were underweight. The two groups were well-balanced regarding all factors evaluated. In the multivariate analysis, underweight status was an independent indicator of lower 3-year OS [hazard ratio (HR)=2.65; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.08-6.50; P=0.033] and CSS (HR=3.51, 95% CI: 1.16-10.60; P=0.025) rates. Compared with the non-underweight group, the underweight group had significantly worse 3-year OS (66.7 vs. 86.5%, respectively; P=0.017) and CSS (74.1 vs. 90.9%, respectively; P=0.025) rates. Therefore, underweight status was a significant risk factor for poor survival in elderly CRC patients. The development of effective nutritional interventions may improve the prognosis of such patients.",nonCancer

In this paper we present a simple bone marrow-like niche model, which comprises of nanomagnetically levitated stem cells cultured as multicellular spheroids within a type I collagen gel. The stem cells maintained are nestin positive and remain quiescent until regenerative demand is placed upon them. In respond to co-culture wounding they migrate and appropriately differentiate upon engraftment. This tissue engineered regeneration-responsive bone marrow-like niche model will allow for greater understanding of stem cell response to injury, but also facilitate as a testing platform for drug candidates in a multi-well plate format.",nonCancer

We hypothesized that VPA would induce significant changes in the proteome of healthy humans when given at doses lower than those used in prior animal studies.|Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained from three healthy subjects randomized to receive VPA (120 mg/kg over one hour) at baseline, 4, and 8 hours following infusion. Detailed proteomic analysis was performed using 1D gel electrophoresis, liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry.

The aim of this work was to evaluate the genetic variability of M. pachydermatis strains isolated from symptomatic dogs and cats and determine a correlation between genotype and phenotype. For this purpose eleven strains of M. pachydermatis were molecularly classified by nested-polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) based on ITS-1 and ITS-2 regions, specific for fungal rRNA genes. Furthermore, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was applied for genetic typing of M. pachydermatis isolates identifying four different genotypes. Strains belonging to genotype 1 produced the highest amount of biofilm and phospholipase activity. The inflammatory response induced by M. pachydermatis strains in immortalized human keratinocytes (HaCat cells) was significantly different when we compared the results obtained from each strain. In particular, HaCat cells infected with the strains belonging to genotypes 1 and 2 triggered the highest levels of increase in TLR-2, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, COX-2 and MMP-9 expression. By contrast, cells infected with the strains of genotype 3 and those of genotype 4 did not significantly induce TLR-2 and cytokines. The results obtained might suggest a possible association between genotype and virulence factors expressed by M. pachydermatis strains. This highlights the need for a more accurate identification of the yeast to improve the therapeutic approach and to monitor the onset of human infections caused by this emergent zoonotic pathogen.",nonCancer
2256,Cancer Cells with Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres Do Not Display a General Hypersensitivity to ATR Inhibition.,"Telomere maintenance is a hallmark of cancer as it provides cancer cells with cellular immortality. A significant fraction of tumors uses the alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) pathway to elongate their telomeres and to gain an unlimited proliferation potential. Since the ALT pathway is unique to cancer cells, it represents a potentially valuable, currently unexploited target for anti-cancer therapies. Recently, it was proposed that ALT renders cells hypersensitive to ataxia telangiectasia- and RAD3-related (ATR) protein inhibitors (Flynn et al., Science 347, 273). Here, we measured the response of various ALT- or telomerase-positive cell lines to the ATR inhibitor VE-821. In addition, we compared the effect of the inhibitor on cell viability in isogenic cell lines, in which ALT was active or suppressed. In these experiments, a general ATR inhibitor sensitivity of cells with ALT could not be confirmed. We rather propose that the observed variations in sensitivity reflect differences between cell lines that are unrelated to ALT.",nonCancer
1544,Newborn Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening Using Pulse Oximetry: Nursing Aspects.,"Congenital heart disease (CCHD) is the most common birth defect. Screening for the most critical forms (CCHD) using pulse oximetry was added to the Recommended Uniform Screening Panel in the United States in 2011. Since then, CCHD screening has become nearly universal in the United States. Nurses are ideally situated to contribute to the development of best practices for implementation and provide education to families on CCHD screening. Much of the standardization, advocacy, and development of national recommendations occurred with key input from nurses. Nurses often have responsibility for educating parents, performing the screening, interpreting the screening algorithm, and the documentation of results. The nurse role often includes implementing follow-up quality improvement initiatives to ensure that systematic and accurate screening occurs. Smooth implementation can be achieved by identifying champions early, obtaining input from a multidisciplinary team including both physician and nursing leaders, and identifying ways to integrate screening into already existing workflow. By knowing the basics of why screening is important, how to screen, current recommendations on the follow-up for positive screens and the limitations of CCHD screening, nurses can advocate for their patients and positively impact outcomes for infants born with CCHD through early identification before discharge.",nonCancer
415,MDM2 is an important prognostic and predictive factor for platin-pemetrexed therapy in malignant pleural mesotheliomas and deregulation of P14/ARF (encoded by CDKN2A) seems to contribute to an MDM2-driven inactivation of P53.,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a highly aggressive tumour that is first-line treated with a combination of cisplatin and pemetrexed. Until now, predictive and prognostic biomarkers are lacking, making it a non-tailored therapy regimen with unknown outcome. P53 is frequently inactivated in MPM, but mutations are extremely rare. MDM2 and P14/ARF are upstream regulators of P53 that may contribute to P53 inactivation. A total of 72 MPM patients were investigated. MDM2 immunoexpression was assessed in 65 patients. MDM2 and P14/ARF mRNA expression was analysed in 48 patients of the overall collective. The expression results were correlated to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). OS and PFS correlated highly significantly with MDM2 mRNA and protein expression, showing a dismal prognosis for patients with elevated MDM2 expression (for OS: Score (logrank) test: P⩽0.002, and for PFS: Score (logrank) test; P<0.007). MDM2 was identified as robust prognostic and predictive biomarker for MPM on the mRNA and protein level. P14/ARF mRNA expression reached no statistical significance, but Kaplan-Meier curves distinguished patients with low P14/ARF expression and hence shorter survival from patients with higher expression and prolonged survival. MDM2 is a prognostic and predictive marker for a platin-pemetrexed therapy of patients with MPMs. Downregulation of P14/ARF expression seems to contribute to MDM2-overexpression-mediated P53 inactivation in MPM patients.",cancer
323,PD-1 and PD-L1 Expression in NSCLC Indicate a Favorable Prognosis in Defined Subgroups.,"Immunotherapy can become a crucial therapeutic option to improve prognosis for lung cancer patients. First clinical trials with therapies targeting the programmed cell death receptor PD-1 and its ligand PD-L1 have shown promising results in several solid tumors. However, in lung cancer the diagnostic, prognostic and predictive value of these immunologic factors remains unclear. The impact of both factors was evaluated in a study collective of 321 clinically well-annotated patients with non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) using immunohistochemistry. PD-1 expression by tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was found in 22%, whereas tumor cell associated PD-L1 expression was observed in 24% of the NSCLC tumors. In Fisher's exact test a positive correlation was found for PD-L1 and Bcl-xl protein expression (p = 0.013). Interestingly, PD-L1 expression on tumor cells was associated with improved overall survival in pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas (SCC, p = 0.042, log rank test), with adjuvant therapy (p = 0.017), with increased tumor size (pT2-4, p = 0.039) and with positive lymph node status (pN1-3, p = 0.010). These observations were confirmed by multivariate cox regression models. One major finding of our study is the identification of a prognostic implication of PD-L1 in subsets of NSCLC patients with pulmonary SCC, with increased tumor size, with a positive lymph node status and NSCLC patients who received adjuvant therapies. This study provides first data for immune-context related risk stratification of NSCLC patients. Further studies are necessary both to confirm this observation and to evaluate the predictive value of PD-1 and PD-L1 in NSCLC in the context of PD-1 inhibition.",cancer
1136,Predictive biomarkers of sensitivity to the phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase inhibitor GDC-0941 in breast cancer preclinical models.,"The class I phosphatidylinositol 3' kinase (PI3K) plays a major role in proliferation and survival in a wide variety of human cancers. A key factor in successful development of drugs targeting this pathway is likely to be the identification of responsive patient populations with predictive diagnostic biomarkers. This study sought to identify candidate biomarkers of response to the selective PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941. We used a large panel of breast cancer cell lines and in vivo xenograft models to identify candidate predictive biomarkers for a selective inhibitor of class I PI3K that is currently in clinical development. The approach involved pharmacogenomic profiling as well as analysis of gene expression data sets from cells profiled at baseline or after GDC-0941 treatment. We found that models harboring mutations in PIK3CA, amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or dual alterations in two pathway components were exquisitely sensitive to the antitumor effects of GDC-0941. We found that several models that do not harbor these alterations also showed sensitivity, suggesting a need for additional diagnostic markers. Gene expression studies identified a collection of genes whose expression was associated with in vitro sensitivity to GDC-0941, and expression of a subset of these genes was found to be intimately linked to signaling through the pathway.

To identify predictive biomarkers, sensitivity to GSK1120212 was profiled for 218 solid tumor cell lines and 81 hematologic malignancy cell lines. For solid tumors, RAF/RAS mutation was a strong predictor of sensitivity. Among RAF/RAS mutant lines, co-occurring PIK3CA/PTEN mutations conferred a cytostatic response instead of a cytotoxic response for colon cancer cells that have the biggest representation of the comutations. Among KRAS mutant cell lines, transcriptomics analysis showed that cell lines with an expression pattern suggestive of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition were less sensitive to GSK1120212. In addition, a proportion of cell lines from certain tissue types not known to carry frequent RAF/RAS mutations also seemed to be sensitive to GSK1120212. Among these were breast cancer cell lines, with triple negative breast cancer cell lines being more sensitive than cell lines from other breast cancer subtypes. We identified a single gene DUSP6, whose expression was associated with sensitivity to GSK1120212 and lack of expression associated with resistance irrelevant of RAF/RAS status. Among hematologic cell lines, acute myeloid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia cell lines were particularly sensitive. Overall, this comprehensive predictive biomarker analysis identified additional efficacy biomarkers for GSK1120212 in RAF/RAS mutant solid tumors and expanded the indication for GSK1120212 to patients who could benefit from this therapy despite the RAF/RAS wild-type status of their tumors.",cancer
1214,Nilotinib rapidly reverses breakpoint cluster region-Abelson oncogene fusion gene and M244V mutations in a patient with chronic myelogenous leukemia: A case report.,"Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is a condition characterized by a balanced genetic translocation, t (9;22) (q34;q11.2), which leads to a fusion of the Abelson oncogene (ABL) from chromosome 9q34 with the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene on chromosome 22q11.2. This rearrangement is referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome. At a molecular level, this translocation results in the formation of the BCR-ABL fusion oncogene, which translates into a BCR-ABL oncoprotein. Imatinib, nilotinib and dasatinib are three tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of patients diagnosed with CML in the chronic phase (CML-CP). The present study describes the case of a patient with imatinib-resistant CML who, following two months of treatment with nilotinib, no longer exhibited detectable BCR-ABL fusion genes or M244V mutations. This suggests that nilotinib may be effective for treating CML cases in which the BCR-ABL fusion protein has an M244V mutation.",cancer
1806,The association analysis of hOGG1 genetic variants and gastric cancer risk in a Chinese population.,"Human 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (hOGG1) is known to play an important role in the prevention of carcinogenesis, including gastric cancer (GC). We performed a case-control study to investigate whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of hOGG1 are associated with GC risk in a Chinese population. Two potential functional tagSNPs (rs159153 and rs1052133) and a previously reported risk SNP (rs125701) were genotyped in 1,275 GC patients and 1,436 controls. We found that SNP rs125701 G > A was significantly associated with the increased GC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05-1.79 in additive model]. Besides, the functional studies demonstrated that the minor A allele of rs125701 significantly reduced the transcriptional activity of hOGG1 promoter and enhanced the methylation level of CpG site of cg15357639. In conclusion, our results suggested that the SNP rs125701 in hOGG1 promoter was associated with the elevated GC risk, which could act as a new potential biomarker for GC susceptibility. Further functional verification of rs125701 in GC pathogenesis is warranted.",nonCancer
483,Class III β-tubulin counteracts the ability of paclitaxel to inhibit cell migration.,"Class III β-tubulin (β3) is associated with tumor aggressiveness, resistance to therapy, and patient relapse. To elucidate its action, we tested β3's effect on cell migration. Expression of β3 in HeLa and MCF-7 did not alter the intrinsic rate of cell migration, but it prevented the inhibition of migration by low, nontoxic concentrations of paclitaxel. The effects on cell motility were confirmed in CHO cells with tetracycline regulated expression of β3. Cell migration and microtubule dynamics were inhibited by similar concentrations of paclitaxel, but required a 5-10 fold higher drug concentration when β3 was expressed. The directionality of migration was normal in paclitaxel, but cells spent more time in a ""paused"" state during which there was no net movement. These studies support a model in which paclitaxel inhibits cell migration by suppressing microtubule dynamics and β3-tubulin counteracts paclitaxel action by maintaining microtubule dynamic activity. The results provide a potential explanation for the aggressiveness of β3-expressing tumors.",cancer
50,"Dabrafenib and trametinib, alone and in combination for BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma.","Dabrafenib and trametinib were approved for use as monotherapies in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2013, and most recently, their use in combination has received accelerated FDA approval. Both drugs target the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway: dabrafenib selectively inhibits mutant BRAF that constitutively activates the pathway, and trametinib selectively inhibits MEK1 and MEK2 proteins activated by RAF kinases. The phase III study of dabrafenib in BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma reported rapid tumor regression in most patients and a 59% objective RECIST response rate. The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were improved compared with dacarbazine. Toxicities were well tolerated and different from those reported for vemurafenib, the first FDA-approved BRAF inhibitor. Efficacy has been demonstrated in other BRAF-mutant genotypes. The phase III study of trametinib in BRAF inhibitor-naïve patients with BRAF(V600E) or BRAF(V600K) also showed benefit with a prolonged median PFS and OS compared with chemotherapy. Trametinib is ineffective in patients who have progressed on BRAF inhibitors. A phase II trial of combined dabrafenib and trametinib demonstrated higher response rates and longer median PFS than dabrafenib monotherapy, with less cutaneous toxicity. Here, we review the clinical development of both drugs as monotherapies and in combination, and discuss their role in the management of BRAF-mutant melanoma.",cancer
409,Proteomic Profiling of Paclitaxel Treated Cells Identifies a Novel Mechanism of Drug Resistance Mediated by PDCD4.,"Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug effective against numerous cancers. To elucidate cellular pathways targeted by PTX and identify novel mechanisms of PTX resistance, we used a SILAC based quantitative proteomic approach to evaluate global changes of cellular protein abundance in HeLa cells. We identified 347 proteins involved in a number of biological processes including spindle assembly, mitotic exit, and extracellular adhesion whose abundance changes upon PTX treatment. Notably, the tumor suppressor PDCD4 involved in translation suppression was down-regulated by PTX. We demonstrated that PDCD4 is a cell-cycle regulated protein and that changes in its abundance are sufficient to alter PTX sensitivity in multiple human cancer cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of PDCD4-RNA complexes and RT-PCR revealed that PDCD4 mediated PTX sensitivity acts through its interaction with mRNA of UBE2S, a ubiquitin K11 linkage conjugating enzyme critical for mitotic exit. Lastly, high levels of PDCD4 in lung cancer tissues are positively correlated with the longer overall survival time of the examined lung cancer patients with PTX involved adjuvant therapy. Therefore, our proteomic screen for paclitaxel targets not only provided novel insight into the cellular resistance to paclitaxel via the PDCD4-mitotic exit regulation axis, but also offered a predictive biomarker for paclitaxel-based personalized chemotherapy in the treatment of lung cancer.",cancer
616,KDR activating mutations in human angiosarcomas are sensitive to specific kinase inhibitors.,"Angiosarcomas (AS) represent a heterogeneous group of malignant vascular tumors occurring not only in different anatomic locations but also in distinct clinical settings, such as radiation or associated chronic lymphedema. Although representing only 1% to 2% of soft tissue sarcomas, vascular sarcomas provide unique insight into the general process of tumor angiogenesis. However, no molecular candidates have been identified to guide a specific therapeutic intervention. By expression profiling, AS show distinct up-regulation of vascular-specific receptor tyrosine kinases, including TIE1, KDR, SNRK, TEK, and FLT1. Full sequencing of these five candidate genes identified 10% of patients harboring KDR mutations. A KDR-positive genotype was associated with strong KDR protein expression and was restricted to the breast anatomic site with or without prior exposure to radiation. Transient transfection of KDR mutants into COS-7 cells showed ligand-independent activation of the kinase, which was inhibited by specific KDR inhibitors. These data provide a basis for the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-directed therapy in the treatment of primary and radiation-induced AS.",cancer

However, some cases can be occasionally found without bleeding during the endoscopic screening, and the management remains unclear. The aim of this article was to report the efficacy and safety of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for silent gastric Dieulafoy lesions, which presented as protrusion lesions mimicking gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs).|Data from the patients with gastric protrusion lesions who underwent ESD from September 2008 to April 2016 in General Hospital, Tianjin Medical University, China were recorded. Seven cases with pathological diagnosis of Dieulafoy lesion without bleeding were enrolled for further analysis.|A total of 7 patients (2 males and 5 females) with mean age of 57.7 ± 4.15 years were pathologically diagnosed as Dieulafoy lesion. Four of the lesions were located in gastric antrum, 2 in the fundus, and 1 in the body of stomach, respectively. The mean sizes of the Dieulafoy lesions under white light endoscopy and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) were 1.06 ± 0.28 and 0.84 ± 0.29 cm. The origins of these lesions were submucosa (6/7, 85.7%) and muscularis propria (1/7, 14.3%). Three of them appeared with mixed echo under EUS, 3 with hypoechogenicity, and 1 with hyperechogenicity. En bloc complete resection was achieved in all the lesions by ESD with average time of 76.00 ± 16.86 minutes, and no intraoperative bleeding happened. In addition, all patients were followed up for 1 to 53 months, and no recurrence or long-term complications was observed.|Therefore, ESD can be an effective and safe treatment for silent gastric Dieulafoy lesions with clinical presentations of submucosal protrusion lesions mimicking GISTs.",nonCancer
1824,Cajanus cajan - a source of PPARγ activators leading to anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic effects.,"Cajanus cajan is an important legume crop in the human diet in many parts of the world. Due to its pharmacological properties, C. cajan is, moreover, used in traditional medicine for treating skin diseases, diabetes, inflammatory disorders and various other dysfunctions. In this study, we focused on the role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) as a potential therapeutic target of Cajanus cajan and its main compounds for the treatment of cancer, inflammation and inflammation-related disorders. The anti-inflammatory potential of C. cajan and its bioactive compounds and their cytotoxicity on the human cervical adenocarcinoma cell line HeLa, the human colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line CaCo-2 and the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MCF-7 were elucidated. C. cajan and its compounds exerted significant anti-inflammatory activity on lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, showed good cytotoxic effects on the 3 different cancer cell lines and proved PPARγ activity in vitro. The main active compounds were orientin, pinostrobin and vitexin. Cajaninstilbene acid and pinosylvin monomethylether were identified as novel PPARγ activators. Based on these data, C. cajan provides excellent beneficial medicinal attributes and may be used as a potential food or a pharmaceutical supplement.",nonCancer
315,Predictive value of epidermal growth factor receptor expression for first-line chemotherapy plus cetuximab in patients with head and neck and colorectal cancer: analysis of data from the EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies.,"The phase III EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies demonstrated that the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy significantly improved survival in the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) and KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), high EGFR expression was identified as a tumour biomarker that can predict survival benefit associated with the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy. We investigated whether tumour EGFR expression level was predictive of cetuximab benefit in EXTREME and CRYSTAL study patients. Prospectively collected tumour immunohistochemistry data were used to generate an EGFR immunohistochemistry score (scale 1-300) for patients in the EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies. For each study, the association between tumour immunohistochemistry score and cetuximab benefit was investigated. The EXTREME and CRYSTAL studies are registered with Clinical Trials.gov, numbers NCT00122460 and NCT00154102, respectively. Tumour EGFR immunohistochemistry data were available for 411 of 442 (93%) patients from the EXTREME study intention-to-treat (ITT) population and 664 of 666 (100%) patients from the ITT population of the CRYSTAL study with EGFR-expressing, KRAS wild-type disease. The distribution of immunohistochemistry scores was similar between the treatment arms of each study, but differed between studies. A clinically relevant benefit for progression-free and overall survival associated with the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy was seen across the full score range in EXTREME study patients. Similarly, CRYSTAL study patients derived a clinical benefit across the full score range, with no meaningful association between EGFR expression level and benefit. The addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy improved survival in the first-line treatment of recurrent/metastatic SCCHN and KRAS wild-type mCRC regardless of tumour EGFR expression level, indicating that in contrast to findings in NSCLC, EGFR expression level is not a clinically useful predictive biomarker in these settings.",cancer
2259,Immunohistochemistry Study on Androgen and Estrogen Receptors of Rat Seminal Vesicle Submitted to Simultaneous Alcohol-Nicotine Treatment.,"Alcohol consumption is habitually accompanied by the use of other psychoactive substances, mostly tobacco. Nicotine and alcohol affect male accessory reproductive glands function. Most studies have been done on pathologic features of prostate, but there has been no systematic study on the seminal vesicle. Therefore, the aim of current study was to investigate the distribution of androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptors-beta (ER-β) immune reactivities following long-term treatment of alcohol, nicotine or a combination of both substances.|In this experimental study, a total of 40 adult Wistar rats, nine weeks of age, were used. Animals were randomly divided into four groups, including: i. Control group receiving normal saline 0.09%, ii. Ethanol group receiving ethanol 20% (2 ml/kg, via gavage), iii. Nicotine group receiving nicotine (0.1 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection), and iv. Ethanol-nicotine group receiving simultaneous ethanol 20% (2 ml/kg) and nicotine (0.1 mg/kg) treatment. All treatment lasted for eight weeks. Prior to intracardiac perfusion, blood sample was collected from left ventricle. The seminal vesicles were isolated and processed for paraffin blocking. The sample tissues were then studied for distribution of AR and ER-β immunereactivities using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining method. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's test were performed for data analysis. A value of P<0.05 was considered significant.|Our results revealed that the lowest mean number of positive cells belonged to the animals of ethanol-nicotine group that was followed by the ethanol, nicotine, and control groups, respectively. However, there was no significant difference regarding serum testosterone level among experimental groups.|It was concluded that combination of both ethanol and nicotine may be a crucial factor in the expression levels of AR and ER-β.",nonCancer
11,Oncogenic and sorafenib-sensitive ARAF mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Targeted cancer therapies often induce ""outlier"" responses in molecularly defined patient subsets. One patient with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinoma, who was treated with oral sorafenib, demonstrated a near-complete clinical and radiographic remission for 5 years. Whole-genome sequencing and RNA sequencing of primary tumor and normal samples from this patient identified a somatic mutation, ARAF S214C, present in the cancer genome and expressed at high levels. Additional mutations affecting this residue of ARAF and a nearby residue in the related kinase RAF1 were demonstrated across 1% of an independent cohort of lung adenocarcinoma cases. The ARAF mutations were shown to transform immortalized human airway epithelial cells in a sorafenib-sensitive manner. These results suggest that mutant ARAF is an oncogenic driver in lung adenocarcinoma and an indicator of sorafenib response.",cancer
1588,"An evaluation of biosecurity compliance levels and assessment of associated risk factors for Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N1 infection of Live-Bird-Markets, Nigeria and Egypt.","Live bird market (LBM) is integral component in the perpetuation of HPAI H5N1, while biosecurity is crucial and key to the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Biosecurity compliance level and risk factor assessments in 155 LBMs was evaluated in Nigeria and Egypt through the administration of a 68-item biosecurity checklist, scored based on the modifications of previous qualitative data, and analysed for degree of compliance. LBMs were scored as ""complied with a biosecurity item"" if they had good-very good scores (4). All scores were coded and analysed using descriptive statistics and risk or protective factors were determined using univariable and multivariable logistic regression at p≤0.05. Trading of wild birds and other animal in the LBMs (Odd Ratio (OR)=34.90; p=0.01) and claims of hand disinfection after slaughter (OR=31.16; p=0.03) were significant risk factors while mandatory routine disinfection of markets (OR=0.13; p≤0.00), fencing and gates for live bird market (OR=0.02; p≤0.01) and hand washing after slaughter (OR=0.41; p≤0.05) were protective factors for and against the infection of Nigerian and Egyptian LBMs with the HPAI H5N1 virus. Almost all the LBMs complied poorly with most of the variables in the checklist (p≤0.05), but pathways to improved biosecurity in the LBMs existed. We concluded that the LBM operators play a critical role in the disruption of transmission of H5N1 virus infection through improved biosecurity and participatory epidemiology and multidisciplinary approach is needed.",nonCancer
117,Mutant FLT3: a direct target of sorafenib in acute myelogenous leukemia.,"Internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations in the juxtamembrane domain-coding sequence of the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) gene have been identified in 30% of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients and are associated with a poor prognosis. The kinase inhibitor sorafenib induces growth arrest and apoptosis at much lower concentrations in AML cell lines that harbor FLT3-ITD mutations than in AML cell lines with wild-type FLT3. The antileukemic activity of sorafenib was investigated in isogenic murine Ba/F3 AML cell lines that expressed mutant (ITD, D835G, and D835Y) or wild-type human FLT3, in primary human AML cells, and in a mouse leukemia xenograft model. Effects of sorafenib on apoptosis and signaling in AML cell lines were investigated by flow cytometry and immunoblot analysis, respectively, and the in vivo effects were determined by monitoring the survival of leukemia xenograft-bearing mice treated with sorafenib (groups of 15 mice). In a phase 1 clinical trial, 16 patients with refractory or relapsed AML were treated with sorafenib on different dose schedules. We determined their FLT3 mutation status by a polymerase chain reaction assay and analyzed clinical responses by standard criteria. All statistical tests were two-sided. Sorafenib was 1000- to 3000-fold more effective in inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3-ITD or D835G mutations than in Ba/F3 cells with FLT3-D835Y mutant or wild-type FLT3 and inhibited the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in ITD mutant but not wild-type FLT3 protein. In a mouse model, sorafenib decreased the leukemia burden and prolonged survival (median survival in the sorafenib-treated group vs the vehicle-treated group = 36.5 vs 16 days, difference = 20.5 days, 95% confidence interval = 20.3 to 21.3 days; P = .0018). Sorafenib reduced the percentage of leukemia blasts in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of AML patients with FLT3-ITD (median percentages before and after sorafenib: 81% vs 7.5% [P = .016] and 75.5% vs 34% [P = .05], respectively) but not in patients without this mutation. Sorafenib may have therapeutic efficacy in AML patients whose cells harbor FLT3-ITD mutations.",cancer
334,Convergent loss of PTEN leads to clinical resistance to a PI(3)Kα inhibitor.,"Broad and deep tumour genome sequencing has shed new light on tumour heterogeneity and provided important insights into the evolution of metastases arising from different clones. There is an additional layer of complexity, in that tumour evolution may be influenced by selective pressure provided by therapy, in a similar fashion to that occurring in infectious diseases. Here we studied tumour genomic evolution in a patient (index patient) with metastatic breast cancer bearing an activating PIK3CA (phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha, PI(3)Kα) mutation. The patient was treated with the PI(3)Kα inhibitor BYL719, which achieved a lasting clinical response, but the patient eventually became resistant to this drug (emergence of lung metastases) and died shortly thereafter. A rapid autopsy was performed and material from a total of 14 metastatic sites was collected and sequenced. All metastatic lesions, when compared to the pre-treatment tumour, had a copy loss of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) and those lesions that became refractory to BYL719 had additional and different PTEN genetic alterations, resulting in the loss of PTEN expression. To put these results in context, we examined six other patients also treated with BYL719. Acquired bi-allelic loss of PTEN was found in one of these patients, whereas in two others PIK3CA mutations present in the primary tumour were no longer detected at the time of progression. To characterize our findings functionally, we examined the effects of PTEN knockdown in several preclinical models (both in cell lines intrinsically sensitive to BYL719 and in PTEN-null xenografts derived from our index patient), which we found resulted in resistance to BYL719, whereas simultaneous PI(3)K p110β blockade reverted this resistance phenotype. We conclude that parallel genetic evolution of separate metastatic sites with different PTEN genomic alterations leads to a convergent PTEN-null phenotype resistant to PI(3)Kα inhibition.",cancer
206,The aurora kinase A inhibitor MLN8237 enhances cisplatin-induced cell death in esophageal adenocarcinoma cells.,"Esophageal adenocarcinomas are poorly responsive to chemotherapeutics. This study aimed to determine the levels of Aurora kinase A (AURKA) and the therapeutic potential of MLN8237, an investigational AURKA inhibitor, alone and in combination with cisplatin. Using quantitative real-time PCR, we detected frequent AURKA gene amplification (15 of 34, 44%) and mRNA overexpression (37 of 44, 84%) in esophageal adenocarcinomas (P < 0.01). Immunohistochemical analysis showed overexpression of AURKA in more than two-thirds of esophageal adenocarcinoma tissue samples (92 of 132, 70%; P < 0.001). Using FLO-1, OE19, and OE33 esophageal adenocarinoma cell lines, with constitutive AURKA overexpression and mutant p53, we observed inhibition of colony formation with a single treatment of 0.5 μmol/L MLN8237 (P < 0.05). This effect was further enhanced in combination with 2.5 μmol/L cisplatin (P < 0.001). Twenty-four hours after treatment with the MLN8237 or MLN8237 and cisplatin, cell-cycle analyses showed a sharp increase in the percentage of polyploid cells (P < 0.001). This was followed by an increase in the percentage of cells in the sub-G(1) phase at 72 hours, concordant with the occurrence of cell death (P < 0.001). Western blot analysis showed higher induction of TAp73β, PUMA, NOXA, cleaved caspase-3, and cleaved PARP with the combined treatment, as compared with a single-agent treatment. Using xenograft models, we showed an enhanced antitumor role for the MLN8237 and cisplatin combination, as compared with single-agent treatments (P < 0.001). In conclusion, this study shows frequent overexpression of AURKA and suggests that MLN8237 could be an effective antitumor agent, which can be combined with cisplatin for a better therapeutic outcome in esophageal adenocarcinomas.",cancer
1232,The GNAS1 T393C polymorphism predicts survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"G proteins mediate signaling from cell surface receptors to specific intracellular proteins. In vitro cancer cell line studies revealed a link between the Galphas protein and proapoptotic processes. We have recently shown that TT genotypes of the GNAS1 T393C polymorphism display increased transcription of Galphas and a more favorable clinical course in bladder and colorectal cancer patients compared both with TC or CC genotypes. In the present study, 150 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma surgically treated by nephrectomy with curative intent were retrospectively genotyped to elucidate a potential association between T393C genotypes and clinical outcome. The C-allele frequency in the renal cell carcinoma patient group was 0.51, which is not significantly different from that of a healthy blood donor group. Kaplan-Meier curves for tumor progression, development of metastasis, and tumor-related death showed a significant association of the T393C polymorphism with outcome (5-year cancer-specific survival rates: TT, 91%; TC, 81%; CC, 69%; P = 0.015). Multivariate Cox proportional analysis of a 10-year follow-up confirmed the T393C polymorphism as an independent prognostic factor in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Homozygous CC patients were at highest risk for progression (hazard ratio, 2.48; P = 0.009) or tumor-related death (hazard ratio, 3.15; P = 0.018) compared with T-allele carriers. Our results show that besides tumor stage, lymph node status, and tumor grade, the GNAS1 T393C status is a novel independent host factor for disease progression in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma and provides further evidence for the T393C polymorphism as a general prognostic tumor marker.",cancer

439,Nuclear HER4 mediates acquired resistance to trastuzumab and is associated with poor outcome in HER2 positive breast cancer.,"The role of HER4 in breast cancer is controversial and its role in relation to trastuzumab resistance remains unclear. We showed that trastuzumab treatment and its acquired resistance induced HER4 upregulation, cleavage and nuclear translocation. However, knockdown of HER4 by specific siRNAs increased trastuzumab sensitivity and reversed its resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer cells. Preventing HER4 cleavage by a γ-secretase inhibitor and inhibiting HER4 tyrosine kinase activity by neratinib decreased trastuzumab-induced HER4 nuclear translocation and enhanced trastuzumab response. There was also increased nuclear HER4 staining in the tumours from BT474 xenograft mice and human patients treated with trastuzumab. Furthermore, nuclear HER4 predicted poor clinical response to trastuzumab monotherapy in patients undergoing a window study and was shown to be an independent poor prognostic factor in HER2 positive breast cancer. Our data suggest that HER4 plays a key role in relation to trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Therefore, our study provides novel findings that HER4 activation, cleavage and nuclear translocation influence trastuzumab sensitivity and resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer. Nuclear HER4 could be a potential prognostic and predictive biomarker and understanding the role of HER4 may provide strategies to overcome trastuzumab resistance in HER2 positive breast cancer.",cancer

Sorafenib is currently the only approved systemic treatment for HCC. Refametinib, an oral, allosteric MEK inhibitor, has demonstrated antitumor activity in combination with sorafenib in vitro and in vivo. A phase II study evaluated efficacy and safety of refametinib plus sorafenib in Asian patients with HCC (NCT01204177). Eligible patients received twice-daily refametinib 50 mg plus twice-daily sorafenib 200 mg (morning)/400 mg (evening), with dose escalation to sorafenib 400 mg twice daily from cycle 2 if no grade ≥ 2 hand-foot skin reaction, fatigue, or gastrointestinal toxicity occurred. Primary efficacy endpoint: disease control rate. Secondary endpoints: time to progression, overall survival, pharmacokinetic assessment, biomarker analysis, safety, and tolerability. Of 95 enrolled patients, 70 received study treatment. Most patients had liver cirrhosis (82.9%) and hepatitis B viral infection (75.7%). Disease control rate was 44.8% (primary efficacy analysis; n = 58). Median time to progression was 122 days, median overall survival was 290 days (n = 70). Best clinical responders had RAS mutations; majority of poor responders had wild-type RAS. Most frequent drug-related adverse events were diarrhea, rash, aspartate aminotransferase elevation, vomiting, and nausea. Dose modifications due to adverse events were necessary in almost all patients. Refametinib plus sorafenib showed antitumor activity in patients with HCC and was tolerated at reduced doses by most patients. Frequent dose modifications due to grade 3 adverse events may have contributed to limited treatment effect. Patients with RAS mutations appear to benefit from refametinib/sorafenib combination.",cancer

Antibiotic exposure in both cattle and humans found an increased likelihood of Salmonella colonization, whereas in chickens, animals not exposed to antibiotics (organic) were more likely to be Salmonella positive and those that had antibiotic exposure were more likely to harbor antimicrobial resistant Salmonella organisms. In swine literature, only tylosin exposure was examined and no correlation was found among exposure, Salmonella colonization, or antimicrobial resistance. No studies that identified farm antimicrobial use also traced antimicrobial-resistant Salmonella from farm to fork.",nonCancer

The classical t-test in Linear Models for Microarray Data package was used for DEM identification. TG prediction was performed using 5 databases. The regulatory network of the DEMs and their TGs was constructed using Cytoscape. Functional and pathway enrichment analysis was performed.

Hsa-miR-520e and hsa-miR-137 had 4 common TGs, including SNF related kinase, metal-regulatory transcription factor 1 (MTF1), round spermatid basic protein 1 and YTH N6-methyladenosine RNA binding protein 3; hsa-miR-590-3p and hsa-miR-137 had 14 common TGs, including NCK adaptor protein 1 (NCK1), EPH receptor A7, and stress-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein 1; hsa-miR-590-3p and hsa-miR-520e had 12 common TGs, including Krüppel-like factor (KLF) 13, twinfilin actin binding protein 1, and nuclear factor I B. Through the functional and pathway enrichments analysis, MTF1 was involved in regulation of gene expression and metabolic processes, and sequence-specific DNA binding TF activity. KLF13 was involved in regulation of gene expression and regulation of cellular metabolic processes. NCK1 was enriched in the axon guidance pathway. In addition, the functional and pathway enrichment analysis showed certain TGs, such as hypoxia-inducible factor 1α, AKT serine/threonine kinase 2, and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mammalian target of rapamycin, participated in the mTOR signaling pathway. The 3 key DEMs hsa-miR-137, hsa-miR-520e, and hsa-miR-590-3p may have important roles in the process of LS.",nonCancer
19,DNMT3A R882 mutations in patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome.,"Several molecular markers have been described that help to classify patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a heterogeneous hematopoietic tissue neoplasm, into risk groups. We determined the frequency of DNMT3A mutations, their associations with clinical and molecular characteristics and outcome, in primary, cytogenetically-normal AML (CN-AML) and CN-myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). A total of 63 CN-AML and 16 CN-MDS patients were analyzed for mutations in DNMT3A, codon R822 by direct sequencing and mutation of NPM1 and FLT3/ITD. DNMT3A mutations were found in 17/63 (27%) of CN-AML and in 1/16 (6.3%) of CN-MDS patients. Patients with DNMT3A mutations were older (p=0.047), had higher white blood cell (WBC) counts (p=0.046), more often belonged to FAB groups M4 and M5 (p=0.017), and were more associated with NPM1 mutations (p=0.017), than those with wild-type DNMT3A. DNMT3A-mutated patients had shorter overall disease survival (p<0.001) and disease-free survival (p=0.014) when the entire patient cohort was considered, which remained significant in multivariate analysis. We conclude that DNMT3A R882 mutations are recurrent molecular aberrations in CN-AML, less frequent in CN-MDS, and that testing for R882 mutations may provide a useful tool for refining risk classification of CN-AML.",cancer
413,CD44 Isoform Status Predicts Response to Treatment with Anti-CD44 Antibody in Cancer Patients.,"CD44, a cell surface glycoprotein, plays important roles in the development, progression, and metastasis of various tumor types. The aim of this study was to investigate how the expression of CD44 isoforms influences the interaction with hyaluronic acid (HA) and how differential isoform expression impacts antitumoral responses in vivo to treatment with RG7356, a humanized anti-CD44 antibody inhibiting CD44-HA interaction. CD44 isoform expression on various tumor cell lines was analyzed by RNASeq while data on patients with different tumor types were obtained from the publicly available TCGA RNASeq dataset as well as a phase I clinical study (NCT01358903). We analyzed the link between HA production and CD44 isoform expression as well as the consequences of blocking the CD44-mediated cell adhesion to HA using RG7356. The correlation between CD44 isoform expression and antitumor response to RG7356 treatment was investigated in the corresponding murine xenograft in vivo models as well as in a subset of patients treated with RG7356 from a recently completed phase I clinical trial. CD44 isoform expression, in particular expression of CD44s, is associated with HA production and predicts response to treatment with RG7356 in tumor xenograft models. Furthermore, patient data suggest that CD44 isoform status is a potential predictive biomarker for clinical response to treatment with RG7356. We provide new insights into the close interplay between CD44 and HA and a potential biomarker to enrich patient responses to RG7356 in the clinic.",cancer
1032,Immune activation and response to pembrolizumab in POLE-mutant endometrial cancer.,"Antibodies that target the immune checkpoint receptor programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) have resulted in prolonged and beneficial responses toward a variety of human cancers. However, anti-PD-1 therapy in some patients provides no benefit and/or results in adverse side effects. The factors that determine whether patients will be drug sensitive or resistant are not fully understood; therefore, genomic assessment of exceptional responders can provide important insight into patient response. Here, we identified a patient with endometrial cancer who had an exceptional response to the anti-PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab. Clinical grade targeted genomic profiling of a pretreatment tumor sample from this individual identified a mutation in DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE) that associated with an ultramutator phenotype. Analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that the presence of POLE mutation associates with high mutational burden and elevated expression of several immune checkpoint genes. Together, these data suggest that cancers harboring POLE mutations are good candidates for immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy.",cancer
1712,The role of capsule endoscopy in the diagnosis and treatment of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding in older individuals.,"Capsule endoscopy (CE) is currently recommended as the first-line diagnostic modality for the investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB). This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of CE and to determine the subsequent impacts on the treatment of the OGIB episode in older individuals.|Eight hundred and fifty-three patients who underwent CE for the indication of OGIB were investigated in a single center between January 2004 and December 2015. Patients were divided into two groups: those 65 years of age and older and those younger than 65 years of age.|There were no significant differences between older patients and younger patients with respect to the CE completion rate. The diagnostic yield was significantly higher in older patients than in younger patients (55.1 vs. 46.6%, P=0.021). Vascular lesions were the main cause of bleeding in the elderly, whereas ulcerated/erosive lesions were found most frequently in younger patients. Furthermore, 56.0% of older patients with positive CE results had relevant changes in their management plans and received specific treatment on the basis of CE findings.|Our study confirmed the important role of CE in the diagnosis of OGIB and its huge impact on decision making in the management plan for older patients.",nonCancer
744,Altered p16(INK4) and RB1 Expressions Are Associated with Poor Prognosis in Patients with Nonsmall Cell Lung Cancer.,"p16(INK4) and RB1 are two potent cell cycle regulators to control the G1/S transition by interacting with CDK4/6, E2F, and D-type cyclins, respectively. Depending on the tumour type, genetic alterations resulting in the functional inactivation have frequently been reported in both genes. By contrast, much less is known regarding the overexpression of these proteins in the tumor cells. In this study, expressions of p16(INK4) RB1, and CDKN2A copy number variances (CNV) in the tumor cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), respectively, in 73 nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with known 5-year survivals. The histologic type (P = 0.01), p16(INK4) (P = 0.004), and RB1 (P < 0.001) were predictive of survivals. The CDKN2A CNV (P < 0.05) was also significant when compared to those cases without CNV. Therefore, among the molecular genetic prognostic factors, expressions of RB1 and p16(INK4) in the tumor cells were the most strongly predictive of adverse outcomes in stage I and II nonsquamous NSCLC.",cancer
1748,Use of an Enactive Insole for Reducing the Risk of Falling on Different Types of Soil Using Vibrotactile Cueing for the Elderly.,"Our daily activities imply displacements on various types of soil. For persons with gait disorder or losing functional autonomy, walking on some types of soil could be challenging because of the risk of falling it represents.|In this paper, we present, in a first part, the use of an enactive shoe for an automatic differentiation of several types of soil. In a second part, using a second improved prototype (an enactive insole), twelve participants with Parkinson's disease (PD) and nine age-matched controls have performed the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test on six types of soil with and without cueing. The frequency of the cueing was set at 10% above the cadence computed at the lower risk of falling (walking over the concrete). Depending on the cadence computed at the lower risk, the enactive insole activates a vibrotactile cueing aiming to improve gait and balance control. Finally, a risk index is computed using gait parameters in relation to given type of soil.|The frequency analysis of the heel strike vibration allows the differentiation of various types of soil. The risk computed is associated to an appropriate rhythmic cueing in order to improve balance and gait impairment. The results show that a vibrotactile cueing could help to reduce the risk of falling.|Firstly, this paper demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the risk of falling while walking on different types of soil using vibrotactile cueing. We found a significant difference and a significant decrease in the computed risks of falling for most of types of soil especially for deformable soils which can lead to fall. Secondly, heel strike provides an approximation of the impulse response of the soil that can be analyzed with time and frequency-domain modeling. From these analyses, an index is computed enabling differentiation the types of soil.",nonCancer
359,Inhibition of Spleen Tyrosine Kinase Potentiates Paclitaxel-Induced Cytotoxicity in Ovarian Cancer Cells by Stabilizing Microtubules.,"Resistance to chemotherapy represents a major obstacle for long-term remission, and effective strategies to overcome drug resistance would have significant clinical impact. We report that recurrent ovarian carcinomas after paclitaxel/carboplatin treatment have higher levels of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and phospho-SYK. In vitro, paclitaxel-resistant cells expressed higher SYK, and the ratio of phospho-SYK/SYK positively associated with paclitaxel resistance in ovarian cancer cells. Inactivation of SYK by inhibitors or gene knockdown sensitized paclitaxel cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Analysis of the phosphotyrosine proteome in paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells revealed that SYK phosphorylates tubulins and microtubule-associated proteins. Inhibition of SYK enhanced microtubule stability in paclitaxel-resistant tumor cells that were otherwise insensitive. Thus, targeting SYK pathway is a promising strategy to enhance paclitaxel response.",cancer
232,Analysis of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia coding genome: role of NOTCH1 mutational activation.,"The pathogenesis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults, is still largely unknown. The full spectrum of genetic lesions that are present in the CLL genome, and therefore the number and identity of dysregulated cellular pathways, have not been identified. By combining next-generation sequencing and copy number analysis, we show here that the typical CLL coding genome contains <20 clonally represented gene alterations/case, including predominantly nonsilent mutations, and fewer copy number aberrations. These analyses led to the discovery of several genes not previously known to be altered in CLL. Although most of these genes were affected at low frequency in an expanded CLL screening cohort, mutational activation of NOTCH1, observed in 8.3% of CLL at diagnosis, was detected at significantly higher frequency during disease progression toward Richter transformation (31.0%), as well as in chemorefractory CLL (20.8%). Consistent with the association of NOTCH1 mutations with clinically aggressive forms of the disease, NOTCH1 activation at CLL diagnosis emerged as an independent predictor of poor survival. These results provide initial data on the complexity of the CLL coding genome and identify a dysregulated pathway of diagnostic and therapeutic relevance.",cancer
1085,Improved detection of germline mutations in Korean VHL patients by multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification analysis.,"von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominant inherited tumor syndrome characterized by the development of tumors in the eye, brain, spinal cord, inner ear, adrenal gland, pancreas, kidney, and epididymis, associated with germline mutations in the VHL gene. We used sequentially sequencing method and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis and detected germline mutations in the VHL in 15/15 (100%) of VHL patients fulfilling the clinical criteria. Of the 15 distinct mutations detected, large deletions were detected in 5/15 (33.3%) patients, including 4/15 (26.7%) partial deletions and 1/15 (6.6%) deletion of the entire VHL gene by MLPA and the remainder were point mutations detected by sequencing method, of which five mutations were novel. Using MLPA analysis, we detected large deletions including both partial deletions and complete gene deletion, which has not been reported in Korean VHL patients. In conclusion, sequential application of sequencing method and MLPA analysis might make possible to identify germline mutations in most patients with VHL.",cancer

In this trial, we compared lapatinib plus capecitabine with capecitabine alone in such patients. Women with HER2-positive, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed after treatment with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab were randomly assigned to receive either combination therapy (lapatinib at a dose of 1250 mg per day continuously plus capecitabine at a dose of 2000 mg per square meter of body-surface area on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle) or monotherapy (capecitabine alone at a dose of 2500 mg per square meter on days 1 through 14 of a 21-day cycle). The primary end point was time to progression, based on an evaluation by independent reviewers under blinded conditions. The interim analysis of time to progression met specified criteria for early reporting on the basis of superiority in the combination-therapy group. The hazard ratio for the independently assessed time to progression was 0.49 (95% confidence interval, 0.34 to 0.71; P<0.001), with 49 events in the combination-therapy group and 72 events in the monotherapy group. The median time to progression was 8.4 months in the combination-therapy group as compared with 4.4 months in the monotherapy group. This improvement was achieved without an increase in serious toxic effects or symptomatic cardiac events. Lapatinib plus capecitabine is superior to capecitabine alone in women with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with regimens that included an anthracycline, a taxane, and trastuzumab.

885,Spectrum and prognostic relevance of driver gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia.,"The clinical and prognostic relevance of many recently identified driver gene mutations in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is poorly defined. We sequenced the coding regions or hotspot areas of 68 recurrently mutated genes in a cohort of 664 patients aged 18 to 86 years treated on 2 phase 3 trials of the German AML Cooperative Group (AMLCG). The median number of 4 mutations per patient varied according to cytogenetic subgroup, age, and history of previous hematologic disorder or antineoplastic therapy. We found patterns of significantly comutated driver genes suggesting functional synergism. Conversely, we identified 8 virtually nonoverlapping patient subgroups, jointly comprising 78% of AML patients, that are defined by mutually exclusive genetic alterations. These subgroups, likely representing distinct underlying pathways of leukemogenesis, show widely divergent outcomes. Furthermore, we provide detailed information on associations between gene mutations, clinical patient characteristics, and therapeutic outcomes in this large cohort of uniformly treated AML patients. In multivariate analyses including a comprehensive set of molecular and clinical variables, we identified DNMT3A and RUNX1 mutations as important predictors of shorter overall survival (OS) in AML patients <60 years, and particularly in those with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. NPM1 mutations in the absence of FLT3-ITD, mutated TP53, and biallelic CEBPA mutations were identified as important molecular prognosticators of OS irrespective of patient age. In summary, our study provides a comprehensive overview of the spectrum, clinical associations, and prognostic relevance of recurrent driver gene mutations in a large cohort representing a broad spectrum and age range of intensively treated AML patients.",cancer
1958,Cost-effectiveness of cervical spine clearance interventions with litigation and long-term care implications in obtunded adult patients following blunt injury.,"Recent guidelines from EAST conditionally recommend cervical collar removal after a negative cervical CT in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients. Though the rates of missed injury are extremely low, the impact of chronic care costs and litigation upon decision-making remains unclear. We hypothesize that the cost-effectiveness of strategies that include additional imaging may contradict current guidelines.|A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed for a base-case 40 year-old, obtunded, male with a negative CT. Strategies compared included: adjunct imaging with cervical MRI, collar maintenance for 6 weeks, or removal. The probability for long-term collar complications, spine injury, imaging costs, complications associated with MRI, acute and chronic care, and litigation were obtained from published and Medicare data. Outcomes were expressed as 2014 US dollars and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs).|Collar removal was more effective and less costly than collar use or MRI (19.99 vs. 19.35 vs. 18.70 QALYs; $675,359 vs. $685,546 vs. $685,848) in the base case analysis. When the probability of missed cervical injury was greater than 0.04 adjunct imaging with MRI dominated, however, collar removal remained cost effective until the probability of missed injury exceeded 0.113 at which point collar removal exceeded the $50,000 threshold. Collar removal remained the most cost-effective approach until the probability of complications from collar use was reduced to below 0.009, at which point collar maintenance became the most cost-effective strategy. Early collar removal dominates all strategies until the risk of complications from MRI positioning is reduced to 0.03 and remained cost-effective even when the probability of complication was reduced to 0.|Early collar removal in obtunded adult blunt trauma patients appears to be the most effective and least costly strategy for cervical clearance based upon the current literature available.|Level IV- Cost-effective analysis.",nonCancer
2466,Effect of MUC1/β-catenin interaction on the tumorigenic capacity of pancreatic CD133(+) cells.,"Despite the fact that the biological function of cluster of differentiation (CD)133 remains unclear, this glycoprotein is currently used in the identification and isolation of tumor-initiating cells from certain malignant tumors, including pancreatic cancer. In the present study, the involvement of mucin 1 (MUC1) in the signaling pathways of a highly tumorigenic CD133+ cellular subpopulation sorted from the pancreatic cancer cell line HPAF-II was evaluated. The expression of MUC1-cytoplasmic domain (MUC1-CD) and oncogenic signaling transducers (epidermal growth factor receptor, protein kinase C delta, glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta and growth factor receptor-bound protein 2), as well as the association between MUC1 and β-catenin, were characterized in HPAF-II CD133+ and CD133low cell subpopulations and in tumor xenografts generated from these cells. Compared with HPAF CD133(low) cells, HPAF-II CD133+ cancer cells exhibited increased tumorigenic potential in immunocompromised mice, which was associated with overexpression of MUC1 and with the accordingly altered expression profile of MUC1-associated signaling partners. Additionally, MUC1-CD/β-catenin interactions were increased both in the HPAF-II CD133+ cell subpopulation and derived tumor xenografts compared with HPAF CD133(low) cells. These results suggest that, in comparison with HPAF CD133(low) cells, CD133+ cells exhibit higher expression of MUC1, which contributes to their tumorigenic phenotype through increased interaction between MUC1-CD and β-catenin, which in turn modulates oncogenic signaling cascades.",nonCancer
522,"AZD9291, an irreversible EGFR TKI, overcomes T790M-mediated resistance to EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer.","First-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKI) provide significant clinical benefit in patients with advanced EGFR-mutant (EGFRm(+)) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients ultimately develop disease progression, often driven by acquisition of a second T790M EGFR TKI resistance mutation. AZD9291 is a novel oral, potent, and selective third-generation irreversible inhibitor of both EGFRm(+) sensitizing and T790M resistance mutants that spares wild-type EGFR. This mono-anilino-pyrimidine compound is structurally distinct from other third-generation EGFR TKIs and offers a pharmacologically differentiated profile from earlier generation EGFR TKIs. Preclinically, the drug potently inhibits signaling pathways and cellular growth in both EGFRm(+) and EGFRm(+)/T790M(+) mutant cell lines in vitro, with lower activity against wild-type EGFR lines, translating into profound and sustained tumor regression in EGFR-mutant tumor xenograft and transgenic models. The treatment of 2 patients with advanced EGFRm(+) T790M(+) NSCLC is described as proof of principle. We report the development of a novel structurally distinct third-generation EGFR TKI, AZD9291, that irreversibly and selectively targets both sensitizing and resistant T790M(+) mutant EGFR while harboring less activity toward wild-type EGFR. AZD9291 is showing promising responses in a phase I trial even at the first-dose level, with first published clinical proof-of-principle validation being presented.",cancer
514,PTEN activity could be a predictive marker of trastuzumab efficacy in the treatment of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab is the only HER2/neu-directed therapy to have received Food and Drug Administration approval for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer. The efficacy of trastuzumab depends on the HER2/neu status of the tumour and the patient's prior treatment, but even when patients are selected on the basis of HER2/neu gene amplification, the single-agent response rate ranges from 12 to 30% and few patients respond to trastuzumab monotherapy. Here, we propose PTEN as a predictive biomarker for trastuzumab efficacy. Human breast cancer SKBR3 and drug-resistant SKBR3/R cells were investigated. We also examined clinical samples from patients who had been treated with trastuzumab and analysed the relationship between trastuzumab efficacy and PTEN level. The PI3K/Akt signalling pathway was observed to be highly active in the drug-resistant cells, and their level of PTEN was low. Delivery of antisense PTEN duplex siRNA significantly decreased the trastuzumab chemosensitivity of parental SKBR3 cells, and marked activation of Akt signalling pathway was also recognised. Moreover, immunohistochemical investigation revealed that trastuzumab treatment was remarkably successful in cells with elevated PTEN expression. Along with the immune-system-associated cytotoxic mechanism, several mechanisms have been proposed for the effect of trastuzumab. PTEN activity might play an important and major role in its HER2/PI3K/Akt-mediated antitumour effect, and could be a useful biomarker for predicting the efficacy of trastuzumab in the treatment of breast cancer.",cancer
2301,Ancient phylogenetic divergence of the enigmatic African rodent Zenkerella and the origin of anomalurid gliding.,"The ""scaly-tailed squirrels"" of the rodent family Anomaluridae have a long evolutionary history in Africa, and are now represented by two gliding genera (Anomalurus and Idiurus) and a rare and obscure genus (Zenkerella) that has never been observed alive by mammalogists. Zenkerella shows no anatomical adaptations for gliding, but has traditionally been grouped with the glider Idiurus on the basis of craniodental similarities, implying that either the Zenkerella lineage lost its gliding adaptations, or that Anomalurus and Idiurus evolved theirs independently. Here we present the first nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequences of Zenkerella, based on recently recovered whole-body specimens from Bioko Island (Equatorial Guinea), which show unambiguously that Zenkerella is the sister taxon of Anomalurus and Idiurus. These data indicate that gliding likely evolved only once within Anomaluridae, and that there were no subsequent evolutionary reversals. We combine this new molecular evidence with morphological data from living and extinct anomaluromorph rodents and estimate that the lineage leading to Zenkerella has been evolving independently in Africa since the early Eocene, approximately 49 million years ago. Recently discovered fossils further attest to the antiquity of the lineage leading to Zenkerella, which can now be recognized as a classic example of a ""living fossil,"" about which we know remarkably little. The osteological markers of gliding are estimated to have evolved along the stem lineage of the Anomalurus-Idiurus clade by the early Oligocene, potentially indicating that this adaptation evolved in response to climatic perturbations at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (∼34 million years ago).",nonCancer

The value of testing KRAS mutation status, in addition to EGFR GCN, was also explored. FISH analysis of 87 metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with cetuximab was done, recording individual GCN per cell and using different samples per tumor. Performances of published cutoff points and different summaries of EGFR GCN distribution were assessed for response prediction. In our data set, two published cutoff points performed less well than in their training set, yielding positive predictive values and negative predictive values between 40.0% and 48.3% and between 81.0% and 86.5%, respectively. Among summaries of GCN distribution explored, mean and right-tailed distribution of GCN yielded the highest performances. A mean EGFR GCN > or = 2.83 provided an area under the curve of 0.71. Important heterogeneity of repeated measures of mean EGFR GCN was observed within tumors (intraclass correlation, 0.61; within-class SD, 0.40), leading to potential misclassifications of FISH status in 7 of 18 (38.8%) patients if a cutoff point were used. In multivariable analysis, EGFR GCN testing provided significant information independent of the KRAS status to predict response (P = 0.016) and overall survival (P = 0.005). We confirm the association between increased EGFR GCN and outcome after cetuximab. However, because of reproducibility concerns, any decision making based on published cutoff points is not warranted.",cancer

Multiple studies refer a positive association between the consumption of dairy products and birth weight.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of afatinib in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and EGFR mutations. In this phase 2 study, we enrolled patients from 30 centres in Taiwan and the USA with lung adenocarcinoma (stage IIIb with pleural effusion or stage IV) with EGFR mutations, who had no more than one previous chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and no previous treatment with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors. We tested two afatinib starting doses: 50 mg daily and subsequently 40 mg daily, introduced to establish whether tolerability could be improved with retention of anti-tumour activity. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with a confirmed objective response (complete response or partial response), on the basis of Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.0 (independent review). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00525148. 129 patients were treated with afatinib, 99 with a starting dose of 50 mg and 30 with a starting dose of 40 mg. 79 (61%) of 129 patients had an objective response (two complete responses, 77 partial responses). 70 (66%) of the 106 patients with the two common activating EGFR mutations (deletion 19 or L858R) had an objective response, as did nine (39%) of 23 patients with less common mutations. Similar proportions of patients had an objective response when analysed by starting dose (18 [60%] of 30 patients at 40 mg vs 61 [62%] of 99 patients at 50 mg). Of the two most common adverse events (diarrhoea and rash or acne), grade 3 events were more common in patients receiving a 50 mg starting dose (22 [22%] of 99 patients for diarrhoea and 28 [28%] of 99 patients for rash or acne) than they were in those receiving a 40 mg starting dose (two [7%] of 30 patients for both diarrhoea and rash or acne); possibly treatment-related serious adverse events were also less common in patients receiving a 40 mg starting dose (two of 30 patients vs 14 of 99 patients). We recorded one possibly drug-related death (interstitial lung disease). Afatinib shows activity in the treatment of patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma with EGFR mutations, especially in patients with deletion 19 or L858R mutations. The efficacy of afatinib 40 mg should be compared with chemotherapy or other EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors in EGFR-mutation-positive NSCLC. Boehringer Ingelheim Inc.",cancer
419,Thymidylate synthase expression as a predictive biomarker of pemetrexed sensitivity in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Although it has been suggested that a high level of thymidylate synthase (TYMS) gene expression in malignant tumors is related to reduced sensitivity to the antifolate drug pemetrexed, no direct evidence for such an association has been demonstrated in routine clinical samples from patients treated with the drug. The purpose of this study was to quantitatively assess the impact of TYMS gene expression in tumor cells as a predictor of the efficacy of pemetrexed therapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated at our institution. Sixty-two NSCLC patients were included in this study: 16 patients received platins-pemetrexed as first-line NSCLC, and 46 pemetrexed in monotherapy as second- or subsequent-line treatment. Total mRNA was isolated and the expression of TYMS was analyzed by RT-qPCR. TYMS levels were calibrated against expression in normal lung tissue. TYMS overexpression was detected in 61 % of patients and low expression in 39 %. The response rate for patients with low TYMS expression was 0.29 compared with 0.03 in patients with overexpression (P = 0.025). A significant benefit was observed in patients with low expression both in time to progression (average TTP = 56 vs. 23 months, P = 0.001) and in overall survival (average OS = 60 vs. 25 months, P = 0.002). TYMS overexpression in tumor cells correlated with a reduced response to pemetrexed-containing chemotherapy and might be used as a predictive biomarker in advanced NSCLC patients.",cancer
1925,Urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor promotes proliferation and invasion with reduced cisplatin sensitivity in malignant mesothelioma.,"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare neoplasm associated with asbestos exposure. The prognosis of MM is poor because it is aggressive and highly resistant to chemotherapy. Using a rat model of asbestos-induced MM, we found elevated urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR; Plaur) expression in rat tissues, which was associated with poor prognosis. The proliferation, migration and invasion of MM cells were suppressed by uPAR knockdown and increased by overexpression experiments, irrespective of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA; Plau) levels. More importantly, we found that uPAR expression is associated with sensitivity to cisplatin in MM through the PI3K/AKT pathway, which was demonstrated with specific inhibitors, LY294002 and Akti-1/2. uPAR knockdown significantly increased sensitivity to cisplatin whereas its overexpression significantly decreased cisplatin sensitivity. Furthermore, sera and tissues from MM patients showed significantly high uPAR levels, which suggested the pathogenic role of uPAR in the tumor biology of human MM. In conclusion, our findings indicate that uPAR levels are associated with malignant characteristics and cisplatin sensitivity of MM. In addition to the potential use of uPAR as a prognostic marker, the combination of uPAR abrogation and cisplatin may reveal a promising therapeutic approach for MM.",nonCancer
1001,Disease pattern in Danish patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.,"In this paper, we aimed to collect genetic and medical information on all Danish patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), in order to contribute to the knowledge of phenotype and genotype. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is a hereditary syndrome characterized by multiple hamartomatous polyps in the GI tract, mucocutaneous pigmentations, and an increased risk of cancer in the GI tract and at extraintestinal sites. Over 90 % of patients harbour a pathogenic mutation in STK11. Based on the Danish Pathology Data Bank, the Danish National Patient Register, as well as information from relevant departments at Danish hospitals, we identified patients and collected clinical and genetic information. We identified 43 patients of which 14 were deceased. The prevalence was estimated to be ∼1 in 195,000 individuals. The median age at first symptom was 27.5 with invagination of the small bowel as the most frequent presenting symptom. We noted 18 occurrences of cancer at various anatomical sites, including a case of thyroid cancer and penile cancer. Eight of the deceased patients had died of cancer. Eighteen different mutations in STK11 had been detected in 28 patients. This is the first comprehensive study of patients with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome in the Danish population identified from nationwide registers and databases. We have demonstrated that the expressivity of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome varies greatly among the patients, even within the same families, underlining the great phenotypic spectrum. Patients with PJS should be offered surveillance from childhood in order to prevent morbidity and reduce mortality.",cancer
898,PI3K pathway dependencies in endometrioid endometrial cancer cell lines.,"Endometrioid endometrial cancers (EEC) frequently harbor coexisting mutations in phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway genes, including PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3R1, and KRAS. We sought to define the genetic determinants of PI3K pathway inhibitor response in EEC cells, and whether PTEN-mutant EEC cell lines rely on p110β signaling for survival. Twenty-four human EEC cell lines were characterized for their mutation profile and activation state of PI3K and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway proteins. Cells were treated with pan-class I PI3K, p110α, and p110β isoform-specific, allosteric mTOR, mTOR kinase, dual PI3K/mTOR, mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK), and RAF inhibitors. RNA interference (RNAi) was used to assess effects of KRAS silencing in EEC cells. EEC cell lines harboring PIK3CA and PTEN mutations were selectively sensitive to the pan-class I PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and allosteric mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus, respectively. Subsets of EEC cells with concurrent PIK3CA and/or PTEN and KRAS mutations were sensitive to PI3K pathway inhibition, and only 2 of 6 KRAS-mutant cell lines showed response to MEK inhibition. KRAS RNAi silencing did not induce apoptosis in KRAS-mutant EEC cells. PTEN-mutant EEC cell lines were resistant to the p110β inhibitors GSK2636771 and AZD6482, and only in combination with the p110α selective inhibitor A66 was a decrease in cell viability observed. Targeted pan-PI3K and mTOR inhibition in EEC cells may be most effective in PIK3CA- and PTEN-mutant tumors, respectively, even in a subset of EECs concurrently harboring KRAS mutations. Inhibition of p110β alone may not be sufficient to sensitize PTEN-mutant EEC cells and combination with other targeted agents may be required.",cancer
89,"Prognostic significance of FLT3 internal tandem duplication, nucleophosmin 1, and CEBPA gene mutations for acute myeloid leukemia patients with normal karyotype and younger than 60 years: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","Diagnosis and classification of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are based on morphology and genetics. An increasing number of gene mutations have been found, and some are used for risk classification in AML patients with normal karyotype (cytogenetically normal (CN)-AML). In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined three frequent mutations in CN-AML: mutations of fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3-ITD), mutated nucleophosmin (NPM1), and mutations of the CCAAT enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) gene. A systematic literature search of publications listed in the electronic databases (Embase, Pubmed, Healthstar, BIOSIS, ISI Web of Knowledge and Cochrane) from 2000 up to March 2012 was performed (Fig. 1). Nineteen studies were included and qualitatively analyzed. Two to four studies entered the quantitative meta-analysis incorporating 1,378 to 1,942 patients with CN-AML. Meta-analysis for overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) showed FLT3-ITD to predict an unfavorable prognosis, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.86 and 1.75, respectively. In contrast, meta-analysis of the impact of NPM1 and CEBPA mutations on OS yielded an HR of 0.56 for each mutation, while analysis of impact on RFS produced HRs of 0.37 and 0.42, respectively. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of mutations in the NPM1, CEBPA, and FLT3 genes. FLT3-ITD was associated with worse prognosis, whereas mutations in NPM1 and CEBPA genes were associated with a favorable prognosis.",cancer
1677,High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels and risk of cancer in HIV-infected subjects: Data from the ICONA Foundation Cohort.,"Investigation of the relationship between high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-c) and the risk of developing cancer in a prospective cohort of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients.The Italian Cohort of Antiretroviral-naïve Patients Foundation Cohort is an Italian multicenter observational study recruiting HIV-positive patients while still antiretroviral treatment-naïve, regardless of the reason since 1997.Patients with at least 1 HDL-c value per year since enrollment and one such value before antiretroviral treatment initiation were included. HDL-c values were categorized as either low (<39 mg/dL in males or <49 mg/dL in females) or normal. Cancer diagnoses were classified as AIDS-defining malignancies (ADMs) or non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADMs). Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional-hazards regression models were used.Among 4897 patients (13,440 person-years of follow-up [PYFU]), 104 diagnoses of cancer were observed (56 ADMs, 48 NADMs) for an overall incidence rate of 7.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.3-9.2) per 1000 PYFU.Low HDL-c values at enrollment were associated with higher risk both of cancer (crude hazard ratio [HR] 1.72, 95% CI 1.16-2.56, P = 0.007) and of NADM (crude HR 2.50, 95% CI 1.35-4.76, P = 0.003). Multivariate analysis showed that the risk of cancer diagnosis was higher in patients with low HDL-c values (adjusted HR [AHR] 1.87, 95% CI 1.18-2.95, P = 0.007) in older patients, those patients more recently enrolled, and in those with low current cluster of differentiation 4+ levels, and/or high current HIV-ribonucleic acid.The multivariate model confirmed an association between HDL-c (AHR 2.61, 95% CI 1.40-4.89, P = 0.003) and risk of NADM.Low HDL-c is an independent predictor of cancer in HIV-1-infected subjects.",nonCancer
2507,Significance of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and interleukin-6 levels in immunoglobulin treatment of Kawasaki disease in children.,"The aim of the study was to investigate the significance of the level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25-(OH)D3] and interleukin (IL)-6 in serum prior to and after immunoglobulin treatment in children suffering from Kawasaki disease in order to provide a reference for the successful treatment of Kawasaki disease in children. From February, 2013 to February, 2015, 45 patients with Kawasaki disease were enrolled in the observation group. The normal control group comprised 43 healthy volunteers and the feverish control group 46 patients with respiratory infection and fever. Venous blood was collected from each case before and after immunoglobulin treatment and the level of 25-(OH)D3 and IL-6 in the serum were measured using fluorescent quantitative PCR, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting. Before treatment, the level of 25-(OH)D3 in the feverish control group was significantly lower than that of the normal control group, while the level of 25-(OH)D3 in the observation group was significantly higher than that of the normal control group. The level of 25-(OH)D3 in the feverish control group was lower than the IL-6 level in the normal children, but the difference was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The level 25-(OH)D3 in the observation group was significantly higher than the IL-6 level in the normal control group. The serum content of 25-(OH)D3 was significantly higher after the treatment compared to before treatment levels and after treatment IL-6 level was only slightly lower. It was observed that the 25-(OH)D3 level in the observation group was significantly increased after immunoglobulin treatment and this was positively correlated with the effects of the treatment. The IL-6 level had no significant changes after treatment and had little correlation with the treatment effect. The results suggested that 25-(OH)D3 may be involved in the occurrence of Kawasaki disease in children and in the aggravation of the disease to some extent.",nonCancer
702,Loss of the deubiquitylase BAP1 alters class I histone deacetylase expression and sensitivity of mesothelioma cells to HDAC inhibitors.,"Histone deacetylases are important targets for cancer therapeutics, but their regulation is poorly understood. Our data show coordinated transcription of HDAC1 and HDAC2 in lung cancer cell lines, but suggest HDAC2 protein expression is cell-context specific. Through an unbiased siRNA screen we found that BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) regulates their expression, with HDAC2 reduced and HDAC1 increased in BAP1 depleted cells. BAP1 loss-of-function is increasingly reported in cancers including thoracic malignancies, with frequent mutation in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Endogenous HDAC2 directly correlates with BAP1 across a panel of lung cancer cell lines, and is downregulated in mesothelioma cell lines with genetic BAP1 inactivation. We find that BAP1 regulates HDAC2 by increasing transcript abundance, rather than opposing its ubiquitylation. Importantly, although total cellular HDAC activity is unaffected by transient depletion of HDAC2 or of BAP1 due to HDAC1 compensation, this isoenzyme imbalance sensitizes MSTO-211H cells to HDAC inhibitors. However, other established mesothelioma cell lines with low endogenous HDAC2 have adapted to become more resistant to HDAC inhibition. Our work establishes a mechanism by which BAP1 loss alters sensitivity of cancer cells to HDAC inhibitors. Assessment of BAP1 and HDAC expression may ultimately help identify patients likely to respond to HDAC inhibitors.",cancer
185,Low CAIX expression and absence of VHL gene mutation are associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor survival of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"We attempted to describe, in a series of clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the relationship between CAIX expression, VHL gene mutations, tumor characteristics and outcome. Radical nephrectomy was performed in 100 patients. Genomic DNA was extracted from frozen tumor samples. Four amplimers covering the whole coding sequence of the VHL gene were synthesized by PCR and sequenced. The monoclonal antibody M75 was used to evaluate CAIX protein expression immunohistochemically. VHL mutations were identified in 58 patients (58%) and high CAIX expression (>85%) was observed in 78 (78%). Tumors with VHL mutation showed higher CAIX expression than those without (p = 0.02). Low CAIX expression and absence of VHL mutation were associated with a more advanced tumors e.g., higher T stages and presence of metastases. VHL mutation and high CAIX expression predicted longer progression-free survival (p = 0.037) and disease-specific survival (p = 0.001), respectively. In combination, they defined three prognostic groups (p = 0.002): (i) good prognosis, defined as VHL mutation and high CAIX (2-year survival: 86%), (ii) intermediate prognosis with either VHL mutation or high CAIX (69%), and (iii) poor prognosis with no VHL mutation and low CAIX (45%, median survival 18 months). CAIX expression, but not VHL mutational status, was an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. Taken together, CAIX expression and VHL mutational status are able to stratify patients with clear cell RCC into distinct groups with regards to clinicopathological variables and prognosis, with low CAIX expression and absence of VHL mutation being associated with a poor clinicopathological phenotype and diminished survival.",cancer
1482,3D-Membrane Stacks On Supported Membranes Composed Of Diatom Lipids Induced By Long-chain Polyamines.,"Long-chain polyamines (LCPAs) are intimately involved in the biomineralization process of diatoms taking place in silica deposition vesicles being acidic compartments surrounded by a lipid bilayer. Here, we addressed the question whether and how LCPAs interact with lipid membranes composed of glycerophospholipids and glyceroglycolipids mimicking the membranes of diatoms and higher plants. Solid supported lipid bilayers and -monolayers containing the three major components that are unique in diatoms and higher plants, i.e., monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) and sulfoquinovosyldiacylglycerol (SQDG) were prepared on mica surfaces by spreading small unilamellar vesicles. The integrity of the membranes was investigated by fluorescence microscopy and atomic force microscopy showing continuous flat bilayers and monolayers with small protrusions on top of the membrane. The addition of a synthetic polyamine composed of 13 amine groups separated by a propyl spacer (C3N13) results in flat but three-dimensional membrane stacks within minutes. The membrane stacks are connected with the underlying membrane as verified by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. Membrane stack formation was found to be independent of the lipid composition, i.e. neither glyceroglycolipids nor negatively charged lipids were required. However, the formation process was strongly dependent on the chain length of the polyamine. Whereas short polyamines such as the naturally occurring spermidine, spermine as well as the synthetic polyamines C3N4 and C3N5 do not induce stack formation, those containing seven and more amine groups (C3N7, C3N13, and C3N18) do form membrane stacks. The observed stack formation might have implications for the stability and expansion of the silica deposition vesicle during valve and girdle band formation in diatoms.",nonCancer
2518,Increased expression of fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum in the valproic acid model of autism.,"The primary aim of the present study was to investigate alterations in enzymes associated with fatty acid synthesis, namely fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of the valproic acid (VPA)-induced animal model of autism. In this model, pregnant rats were given a single intraperitoneal injection of VPA, and prefrontal cortex and cerebellum samples from their pups were analyzed. The results of western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses demonstrated that the protein and mRNA expression levels of FASN, ACC and phospho-ACC (pACC) were increased in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of the VPA model of autism. Furthermore, in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum of the VPA model of autism, AMPK expression is increased, whereas PI3K and Akt expression are unchanged. This suggests that disorder of the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/FASN and/or adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/ACC pathway may be involved in the pathogenesis of autism. It is hypothesized that fatty acid synthesis participates in autism through PI3K/Akt/FASN and AMPK/ACC pathways.",nonCancer
1490,Let the Individuals Directly Concerned Decide: A Solution to Tragic Choices in Genetic Risk Information.,"Health-care systems as well as legislators and society seem largely unprepared to face and manage the massive production of genetic risk information. Ethics committees and professional bodies usually do not involve the individuals directly concerned in defining guidelines for genetic risk communication. Therefore, they do not always reflect people's needs and preferences. We argue in this article that we currently experience a cultural shift in medicine where individuals' concerns and preferences regarding genetic risk information are playing a more significant role than before, and that this should have some normative implications. We are going toward a situation where individual citizens are approached as consumers by personal genomics companies [Prainsack: Account Res 2011;18:132-147]. In clinical and research contexts, individuals are also increasingly informed about their own responsibilities for counterbalancing their genetic risk by making individual health care and lifestyle choices. In this situation, communication of genetic risk information may rather be regulated like traffic and markets in which consumers' decision-making power has a fundamental role in the management and regulation of how a service should be provided, as well as in the creation of policy and legislation. We acknowledge that markets may be different depending on different genetic conditions. For example, genetic risk communication for rare diseases, where a close relationship with clinicians is of paramount significance, should be differently regulated than personal genetic profiles of complex diseases, where contributing risk factors related to lifestyle are modifiable by the individual.",nonCancer
1847,Acquired and Participatory Competencies in Health Professions Education: Definition and Assessment in Global Health.,"Many health professions education programs in high-income countries (HICs) have adopted a competency-based approach to learning. Although global health programs have followed this trend, defining and assessing competencies has proven problematic, particularly in resource-constrained settings of low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where HIC students and trainees perform elective work. In part, this is due to programs failing to take sufficient account of local learning, cultural, and health contexts.A major divide between HIC and LMIC settings is that the learning contexts of HICs are predominantly individualist, whereas those of LMICs are generally collectivist. Individualist cultures view learning as something that the individual acquires independent of context and can possess; collectivist cultures view learning as arising dynamically from specific contexts through group participation.To bridge the individualist-collectivist learning divide, the author proposes that competencies be classified as either acquired or participatory. Acquired competencies can be transferred across contexts and assessed using traditional psychometric approaches; participatory competencies are linked to contexts and require alternative assessment approaches. The author proposes assessing participatory competencies through the approach of self-directed assessment seeking, which includes multiple members of the health care team as assessors.The proposed classification of competencies as acquired or participatory may apply across health professions. The author suggests advancing participatory competencies through mental models of sharing. In global health education, the author recommends developing three new competency domains rooted in participatory learning, collectivism, and sharing: resourceful learning; transprofessionalism and transformative learning; and social justice and health equity.",nonCancer
534,An inhibitor of mutant IDH1 delays growth and promotes differentiation of glioma cells.,"The recent discovery of mutations in metabolic enzymes has rekindled interest in harnessing the altered metabolism of cancer cells for cancer therapy. One potential drug target is isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1), which is mutated in multiple human cancers. Here, we examine the role of mutant IDH1 in fully transformed cells with endogenous IDH1 mutations. A selective R132H-IDH1 inhibitor (AGI-5198) identified through a high-throughput screen blocked, in a dose-dependent manner, the ability of the mutant enzyme (mIDH1) to produce R-2-hydroxyglutarate (R-2HG). Under conditions of near-complete R-2HG inhibition, the mIDH1 inhibitor induced demethylation of histone H3K9me3 and expression of genes associated with gliogenic differentiation. Blockade of mIDH1 impaired the growth of IDH1-mutant--but not IDH1-wild-type--glioma cells without appreciable changes in genome-wide DNA methylation. These data suggest that mIDH1 may promote glioma growth through mechanisms beyond its well-characterized epigenetic effects.",cancer
1786,Seroprevalence of anti-WNV IgG antibodies and WNV-RNA in Egyptian blood donors.,"Transmission of West Nile virus (WNV) from asymptomatic donors has been reported during blood transfusions and organ transplants in humans. In this work, we aimed to investigate the presence of WNV antibody and WNV RNA in blood donors to evaluate the sero-prevalence of WNV and risk for WNV transmission.|Hundred and sixty blood donors were tested for the presence of anti-WNV IgG by ELISA and for WNV 1 and 2 RNA by RT-PCR.|55% of blood donors were seropositive for WNV IgG antibodies, with significantly higher percentage of positive donors coming from rural areas and Nile Delta region compared to other donors. Using RT-PCR all donors were negative for viral RNA of both WNV lineages 1 and 2.|High sero-prevelance of WNV antibodies in asymptomatic blood donors denotes endemicity of the WNV in Egypt and points to the importance of routine screening of blood donors for WNV RNA. On the other hand the absence of WNV RNA by RT-PCR indicates apparent low risk of the blood products as regards WNV transmission. Further studies into significance of WNV seronegativity among Rh negative donors and into the use of WNV seropositive blood in prophylaxis or treatment of WNV neuroinvasive disease are recommended.

H2O2 as oxidant, and an ionic liquid as extraction solvent. Under moderate conditions (50 °C) and short reaction times (<3 h), dibenzothiophene, 4-methyldibenzothiophene and 4,6-dimethyldibenzothiophene could be completely removed from the model diesel. The (pre)catalyst 1 was transformed in situ to the active catalyst [MoO(O2)2(di-tBu-bipy)]. By sequentially performing extractive desulfurization and ECODS steps, 76% sulfur removal was achieved for a real diesel (Sinitial = 2300 ppm). For both the model and real diesels, the catalyst/IL phase could be easily recycled and reused with no loss of desulfurization efficiency.",nonCancer

This commentary suggests that the way the PPDWG members were selected and the perceived secrecy associated with the PPDWG's deliberations almost assured that, despite the hard work and good intentions of the group members, the proposal would raise controversy and could ultimately fail. This commentary provides a personal perspective on some of the issues, assumptions, and preconceptions that arose between members of different theoretical and conceptual camps within the field of personality disorders. It concludes with suggestions as to how we might avoid these mistakes in the future and also how we might take advantage of the PPDWG's substantive work as we make future attempts to improve diagnosis in the area of personality disorders.",nonCancer
592,Increased expression of fibroblast growth factor 13 in prostate cancer is associated with shortened time to biochemical recurrence after radical prostatectomy.,"Fibroblast growth factor homologous factors (FHFs) belong to the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) superfamily, which plays an important role in prostate cancer (PCa). Mining of public database suggests that FGF13 (FHF2) mRNA expression is altered in over 30% of PCa cases. This study examined the FGF13 expression pattern in human PCa specimens and evaluated its potential as a biomarker for patient outcome after radical prostatectomy (RP). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) showed that FGF13 was detectable in the majority of human PCa samples, and FGF13 IHC scores were higher in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia, in primary PCa and in metastatic PCa than in benign prostatic tissue. There was a significant association between high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining and a risk of biochemical recurrence (BCR) after RP. This was also evident in the intermediate to high-risk patient groups. In contrast, positive nuclear FGF13 staining along with low cytoplasmic FGF13 group showed a decreased BCR risk. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that high cytoplasmic FGF13 staining was associated with BCR and that this could serve as an independent prognostic marker in PCa. Several PCa cell lines showed increased FGF13 expression at the mRNA and protein levels compared to the immortalized prostate epithelial cell line PNT1a. Analysis of co-labeled cells suggested a possible interaction of FGF13 with α-tubulin and the voltage-gated sodium channel proteins (Na(V)s/VGSCs). Our data indicate that, for PCa patients after RP, FGF13 serves as a potential novel prognostic marker that improves prediction of BCR-free survival, in particular if combined with other clinical parameters.",cancer
2487,"Regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant, epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 and pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on pulmonary neutrophil aggregation mediated by nuclear factor-κB in lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome mice.","In the present study, the regulatory effect of cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (CINC) and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide 78 (ENA-78) on pulmonary neutrophil (PMN) accumulation in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) mice, and the therapeutic effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), was investigated. BALB/c mice were divided into control, LPS and PDTC + LPS groups using a random number table. The phosphorylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) was detected using a western blot, and the mRNA expression levels of CINC were evaluated using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of NF-κB, CINC and ENA-78 was detected using immunohistochemistry. The production of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10 in serum and broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The total number of leukocytes and proportion of PMNs in BALF was also determined. Following injection with LPS (20 mg/kg), the expression levels of p-NF-κB, CINC and ENA-78 were increased in lung tissue, and the expression levels of IL-8, IL-10 and the number of PMNs increased in serum and BALF. However, in comparison with the LPS group, the degree of lung injury was reduced in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC. In addition, the expression level of p-NF-κB and the production of chemokines in lung tissue decreased in ARDS mice that were treated with PDTC, and the number of PMNs in BALF also decreased. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that the LPS-induced phosphorylation of NF-κB may result in the synthesis and release of CINC and ENA-78, which induce the accumulation of PMNs in the lung. Therefore, PDTC may be used to reduce the production of chemokines and cytokines, thereby decreasing the activation of PMNs in lung tissue and reducing the damage of lung tissue in ARDS.",nonCancer
1445,Charge Transfer Modulated Self-Assembly in Poly (aryl ether) Dendron Derivatives with Improved Stability and Transport Characteristics.,"Alteration of native gelation properties of anthracene and pyrene cored first generation poly (aryl ether) dendrons, G1-An & G1-Py, by introducing a common acceptor, 2,4,7-trinitro-9H-fluoren-9-one (TNF), results in forming charge transfer gels in long chain alcoholic solvents. This strategy leads to significant perturbation of optical and electronic properties within the gel matrix. Consequently, a noticeable increase of their electrical conductivities is observed, making these poly (aryl ether) dendron based gels as potential candidates for organic electronics. While the dc-conductivity (σ) value for the native gel from G1-An is 2.8 × 10^-4 S m^-1, the value increased three times (σ = 8.7 × 10^-4 S m^-1) for its corresponding charge transfer gel. Further, the dc-conductivity for the native gel self-assembled from G1-Py dramatically enhanced by approximately an order of magnitude from 4.9 × 10^-4 S m^-1 to 1.3 × 10^-3 S m^-1, under the influence of an acceptor. Apart from H-bonding and π---π interactions, charge transfer results in the formation of robust 3D network of fibers, with improved aspect ratio, providing high thermo-mechanical stability to the gels compared to the native ones. The charge transfer gels self-assembled from G1-An / TNF (1:1) and G1-Py / TNF exhibits 7.3 and 2.5 fold increase in their yield stress, respectively, compared to their native assemblies. Similar trend follows in case of their thermal stabilities. This attributes to the typical bilayer self-assembly of the former which is not present in the case of G1-Py / TNF charge transfer gel. Density functional calculations provide deeper insights accounting for the role of charge transfer interactions in the mode of self-assembly. The 1D potential energy surface for the G1-An / TNF dimer and G1-Py / TNF dimer is found to be 11.8 kcal mol^-1 and 1.9 kcal mol^-1 more stable than their corresponding native gel dimers, G1-An / G1-An and G1-Py / G1-Py, respectively.",nonCancer
1313,"Evaluation of Efficacy, Acceptability and Palatability of Calcium montmorillonite Clay used to reduce aflatoxin B1 dietary exposure in a Crossover study in Kenya.","Acute aflatoxin exposure can cause death and disease (aflatoxicosis) in humans. Aflatoxicosis fatality rates have been documented to be as high as 40% in Kenya. The inclusion in the diet of calcium silicate 100 (ACCS100), a calcium montmorillonite clay, may reduce aflatoxin bioavailability; thus potentially decreasing the risk of aflatoxicosis. We investigated the efficacy, acceptability, and palatability of ACCS100 in a population in Kenya with recurring aflatoxicosis outbreaks. Healthy adult participants were enrolled in this double-blinded, cross-over clinical trial in 2014. Following informed consent, participants (n=50) were randomized to receive either ACCS100 (3g/day) or placebo (3g/day) for seven days. Treatments were switched following a five-day washout period. Urine samples were collected daily and assessed for urinary aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). Blood samples were collected at the beginning and end of the trial and assessed for aflatoxin B1-lysine adducts from serum albumin (AFB1-lys). AFM1 concentrations in urine; were significantly reduced while taking ACCS100 compared to calcium carbonate placebo (β=0.49, 95% confidence limit: 0.32-0.75). The 20 day interval included both the placebo and ACCS100 treatments as well as a washout period. There were no statistically significant differences in reported taste, aftertaste, appearance, color, or texture by treatment. There were no statistically significant differences in self-reported adverse events by treatment. Most participants would be willing to take ACCS100 (98%) and give it to their children (98%). ACCS100 was effective, acceptable, and palatable. More work is needed to test ACCS100 among vulnerable populations and to determine if ACCS100 remains effective at the levels of aflatoxin exposure that induce aflatoxicosis.",nonCancer

We present a patient with recurrent GBM who achieved a prolonged response to treatment with afatinib, an irreversible ErbB family blocker, plus temozolomide. A 58-year-old female patient was diagnosed with multifocal primary GBM. After surgical resection, first-line therapy comprised radiotherapy and temozolomide. Following disease progression after 3 temozolomide cycles, the patient entered a phase I/II clinical trial of afatinib (20-40 mg daily for 28 days) plus temozolomide (50 mg/m2 every 21/28 days). Next-generation sequencing analysis of the brain tumor specimen was performed. At the last assessment, 63 treatment cycles had been completed and the patient had survived for ~5 years since recurrence. Significant disease regression was observed after 5 cycles and was maintained during long-term follow-up. Adverse events were consistent with the known tolerability profile of afatinib and were managed by treatment interruption/dose reduction. The patient had several epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) aberrations, including gene amplification and EGFRvIII positivity. Three somatic mutations were identified, including an unprecedented extracellular-domain substitution (D247Y). The patient has survived ~6-fold longer than normally expected in patients with recurrent GBM. The complex EGFR genotype may underlie sustained response to afatinib plus temozolomide.",cancer
390,Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor Family Members as Prognostic Biomarkers in Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma: A Systematic Review.,"Since head and neck cancer is characterized by poor survival rates, there is a demand for novel therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers. An upcoming therapeutic target is the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family. However, their prognostic role in head and neck cancer remains unclear. To systematically review current evidence on the prognostic value of FGFR family members in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library was performed for publications up to 14 May 2014. Two reviewers screened all articles and included prognostic studies on the molecular biomarkers FGFR1-5 in any type of HNSCC. Relevant studies were assessed on risk of bias using the Quality in Prognostic Studies (QUIPS) tool. Data on FGFR aberrations and survival outcome were extracted from relevant studies. The prognostic value of FGFR aberrations was compared among studies. The initial search yielded 1568 publications of which 12 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Four studies reported FGFR1 gene amplification (9.3-17.4 %) and FGFR1 protein overexpression (11.8 %) in HNSCC. FGFR1 protein expression by cancer-associated fibroblasts correlated with poor survival outcome in one study (p < 0.01). Eight studies reported high rates of FGFR4 Gly388Arg polymorphisms (32.5-54.2 %) and FGFR4 protein overexpression (16-35 %), with varying correlations with survival. So far, no studies assessed the prognostic role of FGFR2, FGFR3, or FGFR5 in HNSCC. Significant risk of bias has been identified among included studies. Therefore, cautious interpretation of the results is recommended. In conclusion, evidence was found for prognostic value of FGFR1 expression in cancer-associated fibroblasts in HNSCC. Prognostic evidence on the other FGFR family members in HNSCC is limited and conflicting. This emphasizes the need for future well-conducted prognostic studies.",cancer
1418,Symptom Trajectories After Military Blast Exposure and the Influence of Mild Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Blast-related mild traumatic brain injury (blast mTBI) is a signature wound of recent US military conflicts in the Middle East, but the relatedness of postconcussive symptoms (PCS) to the blast mTBI is unclear, and longitudinal symptom data are sparse.|To characterize postdeployment symptom levels and trajectories and to determine relationship to blast mTBI.|A total of 216 participants within 2 years of blast exposure during deployment underwent structured interviews or algorithmic questionnaires for blast mTBI. Detailed symptom inventories for PCS, pain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and depression were taken serially at enrollment, 6 months, and 12 months later. Repeated-measure analysis of variance models were built.|Up to 50% of participants had at least 1 high-grade blast mTBI (with posttraumatic amnesia), 31% had low-grade only, and 19% had neither. Within the entire cohort, all 4 composite symptom scores started high and stayed unchanged. Between blast mTBI groups, symptom scores differed at every time point with some evidence of convergence over time. The PCS groups, different by definition to start, diverged further over time with those initially more symptomatic becoming relatively more so.|History of blast mTBI accompanied by posttraumatic amnesia is associated with greater nonspecific symptoms after deployment, and prognosis for improvement when symptoms are prominent is poor.",nonCancer
2047,Fibrin Networks Support Recurring Mechanical Loads by Adapting their Structure across Multiple Scales.,"Tissues and cells sustain recurring mechanical loads that span a wide range of loading amplitudes and timescales as a consequence of exposure to blood flow, muscle activity, and external impact. Both tissues and cells derive their mechanical strength from fibrous protein scaffolds, which typically have a complex hierarchical structure. In this study, we focus on a prototypical hierarchical biomaterial, fibrin, which is one of the most resilient naturally occurring biopolymers and forms the structural scaffold of blood clots. We show how fibrous networks composed of fibrin utilize irreversible changes in their hierarchical structure at different scales to maintain reversible stress stiffening up to large strains. To trace the origin of this paradoxical resilience, we systematically tuned the microstructural parameters of fibrin and used a combination of optical tweezers and fluorescence microscopy to measure the interactions of single fibrin fibers for the first time, to our knowledge. We demonstrate that fibrin networks adapt to moderate strains by remodeling at the network scale through the spontaneous formation of new bonds between fibers, whereas they adapt to high strains by plastic remodeling of the fibers themselves. This multiscale adaptation mechanism endows fibrin gels with the remarkable ability to sustain recurring loads due to shear flows and wound stretching. Our findings therefore reveal a microscopic mechanism by which tissues and cells can balance elastic nonlinearity and plasticity, and thus can provide microstructural insights into cell-driven remodeling of tissues.",nonCancer
2359,Effects of exercise on fatigue and physical capacity in men with chronic widespread pain - a pilot study.,"There is very limited knowledge about the effects of exercise on men with Chronic Widespread Pain (CWP), especially regarding fatigue. We wanted to investigate the effects of resistance exercise compared with pool exercise on multidimensional fatigue, psychological distress and physical capacity in men with CWP.|Thirty-four men with CWP, with a mean age of 49 (SD 8, range 26-59) years, were randomised to 12 weeks of standardised pool exercise (PE) or resistance exercise (RE). The primary outcome was the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20). Depression, anxiety, isometric force, pain and health-related quality of life were also assessed.|No significant differences were found for changes in MFI-20 between the exercise groups. The RE group improved the isometric forces of right shoulder abduction (RE: ∆2.2 SD 1.5 N, PE: ∆0.6 SD 1.2 N, p = 0.009), right knee flexion (RE: ∆50, SD 50 N, PE: ∆-17, SD 71 N, p = 0.003) and left knee flexion (RE: ∆33 SD 39, PE: ∆-9 SD 52 N, p = 0.017) compared with the PE group. The drop-out rate was 29 % in the RE group and 18 % in the PE group.|Both a resistance exercise programme and a pool exercise programme improved different dimensions of fatigue in men with CWP. There were no differences in the change in fatigue over time between the exercise groups. Resistance exercise improved isometric strength compared with pool exercise. Because different types of exercise appear to improve different aspects of health, the goals could guide the choice of treatment. Further exercise studies with larger groups are needed to gain more knowledge about the effect of exercise on fatigue in men with CWP.|ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier NCT01278641.

1297,Development of Downstream Processing to Minimise Beta-Glucan Impurities in GMP-Manufactured Therapeutic Antibodies.,"The presence of impurities or contaminants in biological products such as monoclonal antibodies (mAb) could affect efficacy or cause adverse reactions in patients. ICH guidelines (Q6A and Q6B) are in place to regulate the level of impurities within clinical drug products. An impurity less often reported and therefore lacking regulatory guideline is beta-glucan. Beta-glucans are polysaccharides of D-glucose monomers linked by (1-3) beta-glycosidic bonds, and are produced by prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms, including plants. They may enter manufacturing processes via raw materials such as cellulose-based membrane filters or sucrose. Here we report the detection of beta-glucan contamination of a monoclonal IgE antibody (MOv18), manufactured in our facility for a first-in-human, first-in-class clinical trial in patients with cancer. Since beta-glucans have potential immunostimulatory properties and can cause symptomatic infusion reactions, it was of paramount importance to identify the source of beta-glucans in our product and to reduce the levels to clinically insignificant concentrations. We identified beta-glucans in sucrose within the formulation buffer and within the housing storage buffer of the virus removal filter. We also detected low level beta-glucan contamination in two of four commercially available antibodies used in oncology. Both formulation buffers contained sucrose. We managed to reduce levels of beta-glucan in our product 10-fold, by screening all sucrose raw material, filtering the sucrose by Posidyne® membrane filtration, and by incorporating extra wash steps when preparing the virus removal filter. The beta-glucan levels now lie within a range that is unlikely to cause clinically significant immunological effects. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer
2100,Correlation between positron emission tomography and Cerenkov luminescence imaging in vivo and ex vivo using 64Cu-labeled antibodies in a neuroblastoma mouse model.,"Antibody-based therapies gain momentum in clinical therapy, thus the need for accurate imaging modalities with respect to target identification and therapy monitoring are of increasing relevance. Cerenkov luminescence imaging (CLI) are a novel method detecting charged particles emitted during radioactive decay with optical imaging. Here, we compare Position Emission Tomography (PET) with CLI in a multimodal imaging study aiming at the fast and efficient screening of monoclonal antibodies (mAb) designated for targeting of the neuroblastoma-characteristic epitope disialoganglioside GD2. Neuroblastoma-bearing SHO mice were injected with a 64Cu-labeled GD2-specific mAb. The tumor uptake was imaged 3 h, 24 h and 48 h after tracer injection with both, PET and CLI, and was compared to the accumulation in GD2-negative control tumors (human embryonic kidney, HEK-293). In addition to an in vivo PET/CLI-correlation over time, we also demonstrate linear correlations of CLI- and γ-counter-based biodistribution analysis. CLI with its comparably short acquisition time can thus be used as an attractive one-stop-shop modality for the longitudinal monitoring of antibody-based tumor targeting and ex vivo biodistribution. These findings suggest CLI as a reliable alternative for PET and biodistribution studies with respect to fast and high-throughput screenings in subcutaneous tumors traced with radiolabeled antibodies. However, in contrast to PET, CLI is not limited to positron-emitting isotopes and can therefore also be used for the visualization of mAb labeled with therapeutic isotopes like electron emitters.",nonCancer
508,"CXCR4, a potential predictive marker for docetaxel sensitivity in gastric cancer.","The aim of this study was to explore predictive genes involved in docetaxel sensitivity of gastric cancer. Microarray analysis was performed to explore various gene expression levels between parental and docetaxel-resistant cells. A panel of 11 genes selected according to microarray analysis were validated and tested further in 11 cancer cell lines, resulting in 4 genes, CXCR4, CDK6, USP15 and CDH1. Histoculture drug response assay (HDRA) was used to examine docetaxel sensitivity, while qRT-PCR was used to measure the mRNA levels of the genes in 25 surgically dissected gastric cancer specimens. Only CXCR4 mRNA levels in gastric cancer tissues were correlated with docetaxel sensitivity (R(2)=0.23, p=0.019) and significantly higher in resistant specimens (p=0.038). AMD3100, a CXCR4 antagonist, enhanced the docetaxel cytotoxicity in vitro. CXCR4 mRNA expression levels may be a potential predictive biomarker in gastric cancer.",cancer
1922,CpG-induced antitumor immunity requires IL-12 in expansion of effector cells and down-regulation of PD-1.,"CpG oligodeoxynucleotides, as a ligand of toll-like receptor (TLR)-9, have demonstrated promising antitumor effects in some clinical trials; however, its toxicity and low efficacy as a systemic therapy has limited its therapeutic applications. In order to improve its therapeutic efficacy, we investigated the mechanisms of CpG-induced antitumor immunity in the context of CD8+ T cell responses. We show that IL-12 is required for the expansion of IFN-γ producing tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells capable of rejecting tumors. In addition, CpGs reduced PD-1 expression by effector CD8+ T cells via the IL-12 pathway. The combination of CpG and PD-1 blockade show a synergistic effect in generation of systemic antitumor immunity. Our studies define a critical role of IL-12 in CpG-induced antitumor immunity and provide a rationale for combined therapy with TLR agonists and immune checkpoint blockade in cancer treatment.",nonCancer
694,Sunitinib therapy for melanoma patients with KIT mutations.,"Recent studies have shown activating KIT mutations in melanoma originating from mucosa, acral, or cumulative sun-damaged skin sites. We aimed to assess the predictive role of KIT mutation, amplification, or overexpression for response to treatment with the kinase inhibitor sunitinib. Tumor tissues from 90 patients with stage III or IV acral, mucosal, or cumulative sun-damaged skin melanoma underwent sequencing of KIT, BRAF, NRAS, and GNAQ genes, FISH analysis for KIT amplification, and immunohistochemistry of KIT protein (CD117). Patients with mutations, amplifications, or overexpression of KIT were treated with sunitinib and responses measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Eleven percent of the melanomas tested had mutations in KIT, 23% in BRAF, 14% in NRAS, and none in GNAQ. Of 12 patients treated with sunitinib, 10 were evaluable. Of the 4 evaluable patients with KIT mutations, 1 had a complete remission for 15 months and 2 had partial responses (1- and 7-month duration). In contrast, only 1 of the 6 patients with only KIT amplification or overexpression alone had a partial response. In 1 responder with rectal melanoma who later progressed, the recurring tumor had a previously undetected mutation in NRAS, which was found in addition to the persisting mutation in KIT. Interestingly, among patients with manifest stage IV disease, KIT mutations were associated with a significantly shortened survival time (P < 0.0001). Sunitinib may have activity in patients with melanoma and KIT mutations; more study is needed. KIT mutations may represent an adverse prognostic factor in metastatic melanoma.",cancer
453,Afatinib demonstrates remarkable activity against HER2-amplified uterine serous endometrial cancer in vitro and in vivo.,"Uterine serous carcinomas (USCs) are an aggressive form of uterine cancer that may rely on HER2/neu amplification as a driver of proliferation. The objective of this paper is to assess the sensitivity of USC cell lines with and without HER2/neu gene amplification to afatinib, an irreversible ErbB tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and to test the efficacy of afatinib in the treatment of HER2-amplified USC xenografts. Eight of fifteen primary USC cell lines (four with HER2 amplification and four without) demonstrating similar in vitro growth rates were treated with scalar concentrations of afatinib. Effects on cell growth, signalling and cell cycle distribution were determined by flow cytometry assays. Mice harbouring xenografts of HER2/neu-amplified USC were treated with afatinib by gavage to determine the effect on tumour growth and overall survival. Primary chemotherapy-resistant USC cell lines harbouring HER2/neu gene amplification were exquisitely sensitive to afatinib exposure (mean ± s.e.m. IC50=0.0056 ± 0.0006 μM) and significantly more sensitive than HER2/neu-non-amplified USC cell lines (mean ± s.e.m. IC50=0.563 ± 0.092 μM, P<0.0001). Afatinib exposure resulted in abrogation of cell survival, inhibition of HER2/neu autophosphorylation and S6 transcription factor phosphorylation in HER2/neu overexpressing USC and inhibited the growth of HER2-amplified tumour xenografts improving overall survival (P=0.0017). Afatinib may be highly effective against HER2/neu-amplified chemotherapy-resistant USC. The investigation of afatinib in patients harbouring HER2/neu-amplified USC is warranted.",cancer
242,Enhanced sensitivity of PTEN-deficient tumors to inhibition of FRAP/mTOR.,"Recent evidence places the FRAP/mTOR kinase downstream of the phosphatidyl inositol 3-kinase/Akt-signaling pathway, which is up-regulated in multiple cancers because of loss of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. We performed biological and biochemical studies to determine whether PTEN-deficient cancer cells are sensitive to pharmacologic inhibition of FRAP/mTOR by using the rapamycin derivative CCI-779. In vitro and in vivo studies of isogenic PTEN(+/+) and PTEN(-/-) mouse cells as well as human cancer cells with defined PTEN status showed that the growth of PTEN null cells was blocked preferentially by pharmacologic FRAP/mTOR inhibition. Enhanced tumor growth caused by constitutive activation of Akt in PTEN(+/+) cells also was reversed by CCI-779 treatment, indicating that FRAP/mTOR functions downstream of Akt in tumorigenesis. Loss of PTEN correlated with increased S6 kinase activity and phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 protein, providing evidence for activation of the FRAP/mTOR pathway in these cells. Differential sensitivity to CCI-779 was not explained by differences in biochemical blockade of the FRAP/mTOR pathway, because S6 phosphorylation was inhibited in sensitive and resistant cell lines. These results provide rationale for testing FRAP/mTOR inhibitors in PTEN null human cancers.",cancer

361,"First-in-human phase I study of pictilisib (GDC-0941), a potent pan-class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor, in patients with advanced solid tumors.","This first-in-human dose-escalation trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, maximal-tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting toxicities (DLT), pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and preliminary clinical activity of pictilisib (GDC-0941), an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of the class I phosphatidylinositol-3-kinases (PI3K). Sixty patients with solid tumors received pictilisib at 14 dose levels from 15 to 450 mg once-daily, initially on days 1 to 21 every 28 days and later, using continuous dosing for selected dose levels. Pharmacodynamic studies incorporated (18)F-FDG-PET, and assessment of phosphorylated AKT and S6 ribosomal protein in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and tumor tissue. Pictilisib was well tolerated. The most common toxicities were grade 1-2 nausea, rash, and fatigue, whereas the DLT was grade 3 maculopapular rash (450 mg, 2 of 3 patients; 330 mg, 1 of 7 patients). The pharmacokinetic profile was dose-proportional and supported once-daily dosing. Levels of phosphorylated serine-473 AKT were suppressed >90% in PRP at 3 hours after dose at the MTD and in tumor at pictilisib doses associated with AUC >20 h·μmol/L. Significant increase in plasma insulin and glucose levels, and >25% decrease in (18)F-FDG uptake by PET in 7 of 32 evaluable patients confirmed target modulation. A patient with V600E BRAF-mutant melanoma and another with platinum-refractory epithelial ovarian cancer exhibiting PTEN loss and PIK3CA amplification demonstrated partial response by RECIST and GCIG-CA125 criteria, respectively.

933,Extreme Outlier Analysis Identifies Occult Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Pathway Mutations in Patients With Low-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer.,"No effective systemic therapy exists for patients with metastatic low-grade serous (LGS) ovarian cancers. BRAF and KRAS mutations are common in serous borderline (SB) and LGS ovarian cancers, and MEK inhibition has been shown to induce tumor regression in a minority of patients; however, no correlation has been observed between mutation status and clinical response. With the goal of identifying biomarkers of sensitivity to MEK inhibitor treatment, we performed an outlier analysis of a patient who experienced a complete, durable, and ongoing (> 5 years) response to selumetinib, a non-ATP competitive MEK inhibitor. Next-generation sequencing was used to analyze this patient's tumor as well as an additional 28 SB/LGS tumors. Functional characterization of an identified novel alteration of interest was performed. Analysis of the extraordinary responder's tumor identified a 15-nucleotide deletion in the negative regulatory helix of the MAP2K1 gene encoding for MEK1. Functional characterization demonstrated that this mutant induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation, promoted anchorage-independent growth and tumor formation in mice, and retained sensitivity to selumetinib. Analysis of additional LGS/SB tumors identified mutations predicted to induce extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathway activation in 82% (23 of 28), including two patients with BRAF fusions, one of whom achieved an ongoing complete response to MEK inhibitor-based combination therapy. Alterations affecting the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway are present in the majority of patients with LGS ovarian cancer. Next-generation sequencing analysis revealed deletions and fusions that are not detected by older sequencing approaches. These findings, coupled with the observation that a subset of patients with recurrent LGS ovarian cancer experienced dramatic and durable responses to MEK inhibitor therapy, support additional clinical studies of MEK inhibitors in this disease.",cancer
486,Phosphorylated EGFR expression may predict outcome of EGFR-TKIs therapy for the advanced NSCLC patients with wild-type EGFR.,"EGFR mutation is a strong predictive factor of EGFR-TKIs therapy. However, at least 10% of patients with EGFR wild-type are responsive to TKIs, suggesting that other determinants of outcome besides EGFR mutation might exist. We hypothesized that activation of phosphorylated EGFR could be a potential predictive biomarker to EGFR-TKIs treatment among patients in wild-type EGFR. Total of 205 stage IIIb and IV NSCLC patients, tissue samples of whom were available for molecular analysis, were enrolled in this study. The phosphorylation of EGFR at tyrosine 1068 (pTyr1068) and 1173 (pTyr1173) were assessed by immunohistochemistry, and EGFR mutations were detected by denaturing high performance liquid chromatograph (DHPLC). Among 205 patients assessable for EGFR mutation and phosphorylation analysis, 92 (44.9%) were EGFR mutant and 165 patients (57.6%) had pTyr1173 expression. Superior progression-free survival (PFS) was seen after EGFR-TKIs therapy in patients with pTyr1068 expression compared to pTyr1068 negative ones (median PFS 7.0 months vs. 1.2 months, P < 0.001). Inversely, patients with pTyr1173 had a shorter PFS (4.8 months VS. 7.7 months, P = 0.016). In subgroup of patients with wild-type EGFR, pTyr1068 expression positive ones had a significantly prolonged PFS (4.2 months vs.1.2 months P < 0.001) compared with those without pTyr1068 expression. Sixteen patients with both wild-type EGFR and pTyr1068 who responded to EGFR-TKIs had median PFS of 15.6 months (95%CI: 7.28-23.9). pTyr1068 may be a predictive biomarker for screening the population for clinical response to EGFR-TKIs treatment; especially for patients with wild-type EGFR.",cancer
947,"A molecularly annotated platform of patient-derived xenografts (""xenopatients"") identifies HER2 as an effective therapeutic target in cetuximab-resistant colorectal cancer.","Only a fraction of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receive clinical benefit from therapy with anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) antibodies, which calls for the identification of novel biomarkers for better personalized medicine. We produced large xenograft cohorts from 85 patient-derived, genetically characterized metastatic colorectal cancer samples (""xenopatients"") to discover novel determinants of therapeutic response and new oncoprotein targets. Serially passaged tumors retained the morphologic and genomic features of their original counterparts. A validation trial confirmed the robustness of this approach: xenopatients responded to the anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab with rates and extents analogous to those observed in the clinic and could be prospectively stratified as responders or nonresponders on the basis of several predictive biomarkers. Genotype-response correlations indicated HER2 amplification specifically in a subset of cetuximab-resistant, KRAS/NRAS/BRAF/PIK3CA wild-type cases. Importantly, HER2 amplification was also enriched in clinically nonresponsive KRAS wild-type patients. A proof-of-concept, multiarm study in HER2-amplified xenopatients revealed that the combined inhibition of HER2 and EGFR induced overt, long-lasting tumor regression. Our results suggest promising therapeutic opportunities in cetuximab-resistant patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, whose medical treatment in the chemorefractory setting remains an unmet clinical need. Direct transfer xenografts of tumor surgical specimens conserve the interindividual diversity and the genetic heterogeneity typical of the tumors of origin, combining the flexibility of preclinical analysis with the informative value of population-based studies. Our suite of patient-derived xenografts from metastatic colorectal carcinomas reliably mimicked disease response in humans, prospectively recapitulated biomarker-based case stratification, and identified HER2 as a predictor of resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor antibodies and of response to combination therapies against HER2 and epidermal growth factor receptor in this tumor setting.",cancer
973,Effectiveness of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Japanese Patients with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer Harboring Minor Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Mutations: Results from a Multicenter Retrospective Study (HANSHIN Oncology Group 0212).,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with minor mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, except for the common 15 base-pair deletions in exon 19 and the L858R mutation in exon 21, is rare, and only few data exist on this patient population. The aim of the present study was to describe the clinical characteristics and to clarify the efficacy of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with NSCLC harboring minor mutations of the EGFR gene. This was a multicenter, retrospective study that analyzed specimens from patients with NSCLC who had minor EGFR gene mutations and were treated with EGFR-TKIs between June 2002 and March 2012. Out of 56 patients with minor mutations of the EGFR gene, 44 were treated with either gefitinib or erlotinib. Mutation sites were G719X in exon 18 (n=35), L861Q in exon 21 (n=11), and G874S in exon 21 (n=1). Three patients had both the G719S and the L861Q mutation. The response rate to TKI treatment was 29.5%, and the disease control rate was 63.6%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 6.7 months [95% confidence interval (CI)=2.06-8.66 months]. The median PFS was 7.2 months (95% CI=4.23-12.3 months) in 32 patients who received first- or second-line treatment with EGFR-TKIs, whereas the median PFS was 1.57 months (95% CI=0.73-3.8 months) in 12 patients treated with EGFR-TKIs as a third-line or later treatment. In multivariate Cox analysis, erlotinib therapy was associated with a longer PFS than gefitinib (p=0.025). Patients with NSCLC harboring minor mutations of the EGFR gene exhibited a modest response to EGFR-TKI treatment. Treatment with first-generation EGFR-TKIs, in particular erlotinib, may be considered a first- or second-line option for patients with NSCLC with minor EGFR mutations.",cancer

Streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats received 0, 10, or 40 mg/kg of ABE orally for 4 weeks, whereas vehicle-injected control rats received distilled water. Level of plasma glutathione and expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), p47phox (NADPH oxidase subunit), and markers associated with autophagy were examined. The glutathione level in the 40 mg/kg ABE-treated diabetic group (ABE-40 group) was higher than that of the untreated diabetic group (ABE-0 group). The HO-1 and p47phox protein expression levels of the ABE-40 group were lower (47% and 33%, respectively) than those of the ABE-0 group. The level of light chain 3B II (LC3B-II) was higher in the ABE-40 group than in the ABE-0 group. Protein levels of p62/sequestosome 1 (p62) in the ABE-40 group were lower than those in the ABE-0 group. Our results suggest that ABE may attenuate STZ-induced diabetic kidney injury by suppressing oxidative stress and (or) by upregulating autophagy.",nonCancer
1470,Meeting the health care needs of transgender people within the armed forces: Putting UK military policy into practice.,"To explain how the healthcare needs of transgender personnel are met within the United Kingdom Armed Forces (UK AF).|It may be that when transgender people disclose their gender preference that they are at increased risk of social exclusion. The UK AF has an inclusive organisational policy for the recruitment and management of transgender personnel.|This is a position paper about how the healthcare needs of transgender military personnel are met by the UK AF.|UK AF policy was placed into context by reviewing current research, discussing medical terminology, and describing the policy. This was followed by an account of how UK AF policy is applied in practice.|Where armed forces had an inclusive policy for the management of transgender personnel there seemed to be little cause for secrecy and zero tolerance of discrimination when compared to nations where this was not the case. Medical terminology has changed to reflect a more inclusive, less stigmatising use of language. The UK AF policy has been described as progressive and inclusive. The application of this policy in practice may be dependent upon strong leadership and training. The wider UK AF seems capable of adopting a pragmatic and flexible approach to meeting the healthcare needs of transgender personnel.|The UK AF value diversity within their workforce and have a progressive, inclusive policy for the recruitment and management of transgender personnel.|When supporting a transgender military person, healthcare professionals, civilian organisations and military line managers should consider referring to UK AF policy as early as possible. Other military and uniformed services may wish to examine the UK AF exemplar in order to consider the applicability within their own organisational setting. This article is protected by copyright.

2378,Advances in glucose metabolism research in colorectal cancer.,"Cancer cells uptake glucose at a higher rate and produce lactic acid rather than metabolizing pyruvate through the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This adaptive metabolic shift is termed the Warburg effect. Recently progress had been made regarding the mechanistic understanding of glucose metabolism and associated diagnostic and therapeutic methods, which have been investigated in colorectal cancer. The majority of novel mechanisms involve important glucose metabolism associated genes and miRNA regulation. The present review discusses the contribution of these research results to facilitate with the development of novel diagnosis and anticancer treatment options.",nonCancer
2253,Effects of Steroids and Curcumin on Prevention of Laryngeal Stenosis Secondary to Trauma.,"The aim of this study was to compare the preventive effects of corticosteroids and curcumin on subglottic stenosis in an animal model.|Twenty-one male German Shepherd dogs were used for this study. After standardized trauma to the subglottic area, the dogs were divided into three groups. Group A received curcumin (450 mg/ day) for 15 days; Group B received beclomethasone (2 puffs/day, 50 µg/dose) for 15 days; Group C received saline spray only. At 6 weeks after the injury, the larynx specimens were examined histopathologically to assess epithelialization, inflammation, and fibrosis.|Complete epithelial covering of the steroid-treated group was significantly less than that of the control group. Despite inflammation and fibrosis, there was no significant difference between the steroid and control groups. In the curcumin-treated group, there was no significant difference between the groups.|Topically applied steroid decreases epithelialization after induced subglottic injury. It is recommended that further studies be conducted in order to investigate the effects of the two drugs on airway stenosis prevention.",nonCancer
2415,Autocrine MCP-1/CCR2 signaling stimulates proliferation and migration of renal carcinoma cells.,"The chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 [MCP-1; also known as chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2] is an important mediator of monocyte recruitment during inflammatory processes. Pathologically high expression levels of MCP-1 by tumor cells have been observed in a variety of cancer types. In the majority of cases, high MCP-1 expression is associated with a poor prognosis, as infiltration of the tumor with inflammatory monocytes promotes tumor progression and metastasis. MCP-1 is also expressed in renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the present study, the function and the regulation of MCP-1 was investigated in two RCC cell lines, CaKi-1 and 786-O. In both cell lines, expression of MCP-1 was significantly enhanced compared with non-cancerous control cells. As expected, secretion of MCP-1 into the medium facilitated the recruitment of peripheral blood monocytes via the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor type 2 (CCR2). As expression of CCR2 was also detected in 786-O and CaKi-1 cells, the effect of autocrine MCP-1/CCR2 signaling was evaluated in these cells. In proliferation assays, administration of an MCP-1 neutralizing antibody or of a CCR2 antagonist to CaKi-1 and 786-O cells significantly decreased cell growth; supplementation of the growth medium with recombinant human MCP-1 had no additional effect on proliferation. The migration ability of RCC cells was impaired by MCP-1 neutralization or pharmacological CCR2 inhibition, while it was stimulated by the addition of recombinant human MCP-1, compared with untreated control cells. Finally, substantial differences in the regulation of MCP-1 expression were observed between RCC cell lines. In CaKi-1 cells, expression of MCP-1 appears to be largely mediated by the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells 5, while in 786-O cells, deletion of the tumor suppressor gene Von-Hippel-Lindau appeared to be responsible for MCP-1 upregulation, as suggested by previous studies. Taken together, the results of the current study indicate that expression of MCP-1 in RCC cells promotes tumor progression and metastasis not only by paracrine, but also by autocrine, MCP-1/CCR2 signaling events, enhancing cell proliferation and migration ability. Therefore, the present findings suggest the MCP-1/CCR2 axis is a potential target for future therapeutic strategies in the treatment of metastatic RCC.",nonCancer
1532,"Primary malignant melanoma of the urinary bladder: clinical, morphological, and molecular analysis of five cases.","The aim of our study was to evaluate the clinical and morphological features of primary malignant melanomas of the urinary bladder. We obtained information on five such cases from three different institutions. These were three men and two women between 52 and 76 years of age. Three tumors presented with hematuria, one with dysuria, and one was discovered incidentally on imaging studies. All were invasive to muscularis propria on transuretral resections performed for diagnosis. Neoplastic cells showed variable patterns (large cell epithelioid, small cell diffuse, storiform, or mixed) in different tumors. Pigmentation was prominent in all except one case. Each case was labeled diffusely for S-100, HMB-45, and Melan-A. Pan-cytokeratin showed a perinuclear dot-like reaction in two tumors. Three cases showed the BRAF mutation in molecular studies. Two patients were already metastatic at the time of diagnosis. Two patients died, one is alive with disease after 15 months, and two patients are disease free at 1 and 5 years of surveillance.",nonCancer
2435,Possible intrinsic association of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis coexisting with multiple myeloma.,"Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a life-threatening condition that causes renal failure. Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant proliferation of monoclonal plasma cells in the blood that can also cause renal failure. The two diseases have high morbidity and mortality rates in the elderly, with a poor prognosis. A 64-year-old female presented to Xinqiao Hospital (Chonqing, China) with fatigue and a poor appetite that had been apparent for 6 weeks. Laboratory tests revealed a serum creatinine level of 10.31 mg/dl, a cytoplasmic ANCA titer of 1:10, a positive result for myeloperoxidase and a serum globulin level of 3.96 g/dl. A renal biopsy revealed crescent glomerulonephritis, combined with the rapid progression of renal function. Based on these observations (ANCA titer, crescent glomerulonephritis and rapid progression of renal function) a diagnosis of AAV was established. MM was confirmed by serum immunofixation electrophoresis combined with bone marrow aspiration. The present study discusses what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first case of AAV coexisting with MM in order to highlight it as a clinical concern.",nonCancer
111,EGFR T790M resistance mutation in non small-cell lung carcinoma.,"Lung cancer patients carrying sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations show dramatic responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, the majority of patients whose disease responds to drugs eventually develop resistance to these EGFR-TKIs. The T790M gatekeeper mutation in the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain accounts for half of resistance to these drugs. In some patients, this mutation is also detected as a primary event before drug exposure, at a frequency that is highly dependent on the technique used. This review will focus on the methods that have been used to detect the T790M mutation, and its potential clinical applications both in TKI naïve patients and in patients with an acquired resistance.",cancer
677,Intracranial Efficacy of Crizotinib Versus Chemotherapy in Patients With Advanced ALK-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer: Results From PROFILE 1014.,"Intracranial efficacy of first-line crizotinib versus chemotherapy was compared prospectively in the phase III PROFILE 1014 study in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer. Patients were randomly assigned to receive crizotinib (250 mg twice daily; n = 172) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) or carboplatin at area under the curve 5 to 6, every 3 weeks for ≤ six cycles; n = 171). Patients with stable treated brain metastases (tBM) were eligible. Intracranial efficacy was assessed at baseline and every 6 or 12 weeks in patients with or without known brain metastases (BM), respectively; intracranial time to tumor progression (IC-TTP; per protocol) and intracranial disease control rate (IC-DCR; post hoc) were measured. The intent-to-treat population was also assessed. Of 343 patients in the intent-to-treat population, 23% had tBM at baseline. A nonsignificant IC-TTP improvement was observed with crizotinib in the intent-to-treat population (hazard ratio [HR], 0.60; P = .069), patients with tBM (HR, 0.45; P = .063), and patients without BM (HR, 0.69; P = .323). Among patients with tBM, IC-DCR was significantly higher with crizotinib versus chemotherapy at 12 weeks (85% v 45%, respectively; P < .001) and 24 weeks (56% v 25%, respectively; P = .006). Progression-free survival was significantly longer with crizotinib versus chemotherapy in both subgroups (tBM present: HR, 0.40; P < .001; median, 9.0 v 4.0 months, respectively; BM absent: HR, 0.51; P < .001; median, 11.1 v 7.2 months, respectively) and in the intent-to-treat population (HR, 0.45; P < .001; median, 10.9 v 7.0 months, respectively). Compared with chemotherapy, crizotinib demonstrated a significantly higher IC-DCR in patients with tBM. Improvements in IC-TTP were not statistically significant in patients with or without tBM, although sensitivity to detect treatment differences in or between the two subgroups was low.",cancer
257,Randomized phase II trial of the efficacy and safety of trastuzumab combined with docetaxel in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive metastatic breast cancer administered as first-line treatment: the M77001 study group.,"This randomized, multicenter trial compared first-line trastuzumab plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients were randomly assigned to six cycles of docetaxel 100 mg/m2 every 3 weeks, with or without trastuzumab 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg weekly until disease progression. A total of 186 patients received at least one dose of the study drug. Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was significantly superior to docetaxel alone in terms of overall response rate (61% v 34%; P = .0002), overall survival (median, 31.2 v 22.7 months; P = .0325), time to disease progression (median, 11.7 v 6.1 months; P = .0001), time to treatment failure (median, 9.8 v 5.3 months; P = .0001), and duration of response (median, 11.7 v 5.7 months; P = .009). There was little difference in the number and severity of adverse events between the arms. Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia was seen more commonly with the combination (32%) than with docetaxel alone (22%), and there was a slightly higher incidence of febrile neutropenia in the combination arm (23% v 17%). One patient in the combination arm experienced symptomatic heart failure (1%). Another patient experienced symptomatic heart failure 5 months after discontinuation of trastuzumab because of disease progression, while being treated with an investigational anthracycline for 4 months. Trastuzumab combined with docetaxel is superior to docetaxel alone as first-line treatment of patients with HER2-positive MBC in terms of overall survival, response rate, response duration, time to progression, and time to treatment failure, with little additional toxicity.",cancer
393,Small molecule FGF receptor inhibitors block FGFR-dependent urothelial carcinoma growth in vitro and in vivo.,"Activating mutations of FGFR3 are frequently identified in superficial urothelial carcinoma (UC) and increased expression of FGFR1 and FGFR3 are common in both superficial and invasive UC. The effects of inhibition of receptor activity by three small molecule inhibitors (PD173074, TKI-258 and SU5402) were investigated in a panel of bladder tumour cell lines with known FGFR expression levels and FGFR3 mutation status. All inhibitors prevented activation of FGFR3, and inhibited downstream MAPK pathway signalling. Response was related to FGFR3 and/or FGFR1 expression levels. Cell lines with the highest levels of FGFR expression showed the greatest response and little or no effect was measured in normal human urothelial cells or in UC cell lines with activating RAS gene mutations. In sensitive cell lines, the drugs induced cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. IC(50) values for PD173074 and TKI-258 were in the nanomolar concentration range compared with micromolar concentrations for SU5402. PD173074 showed the greatest effects in vitro and in vivo significantly delayed the growth of subcutaneous bladder tumour xenografts. These results indicate that inhibition of FGFR1 and wild-type or mutant FGFR3 may represent a useful therapeutic approach in patients with both non-muscle invasive and muscle invasive UC.",cancer
972,Selective Targeting of Cyclin E1-Amplified High-Grade Serous Ovarian Cancer by Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 2 and AKT Inhibition.,"Purpose: Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) amplification is associated with primary treatment resistance and poor outcome in high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSC). Here, we explore approaches to target CCNE1-amplified cancers and potential strategies to overcome resistance to targeted agents.Experimental Design: To examine dependency on CDK2 in CCNE1-amplified HGSC, we utilized siRNA and conditional shRNA gene suppression, and chemical inhibition using dinaciclib, a small-molecule CDK2 inhibitor. High-throughput compound screening was used to identify selective synergistic drug combinations, as well as combinations that may overcome drug resistance. An observed relationship between CCNE1 and the AKT pathway was further explored in genomic data from primary tumors, and functional studies in fallopian tube secretory cells.Results: We validate CDK2 as a therapeutic target by demonstrating selective sensitivity to gene suppression. However, we found that dinaciclib did not trigger amplicon-dependent sensitivity in a panel of HGSC cell lines. A high-throughput compound screen identified synergistic combinations in CCNE1-amplified HGSC, including dinaciclib and AKT inhibitors. Analysis of genomic data from TCGA demonstrated coamplification of CCNE1 and AKT2 Overexpression of Cyclin E1 and AKT isoforms, in addition to mutant TP53, imparted malignant characteristics in untransformed fallopian tube secretory cells, the dominant site of origin of HGSC.Conclusions: These findings suggest a specific dependency of CCNE1-amplified tumors for AKT activity, and point to a novel combination of dinaciclib and AKT inhibitors that may selectively target patients with CCNE1-amplified HGSC.

1948,[Public health policies in Chile: seeking to regain trust].,"Healthcare represents a key area in the public agenda. In the case of Chile, this central part of citizen demands has emerged with an increasing criticism of the health system, its actors and institutions, while a major democratic and legitimacy crisis in Chilean society unfolds. The starting point of this analysis is the link between the critical and widespread societal dissatisfaction with the legitimacy crisis in the health sector. There is an interdependence and parallelism between these two different aspects of the crisis. The analysis is built around the dimensions of trust and legitimacy as a potential driver of the conflict, taking as an analytical framework the socio-political matrix. Conceptual elements around the ideas of trust and legitimacy in public policies are reviewed. This article focuses on recent situations surrounding the dynamics of the Chilean health system such as the rise of the Instituciones de Salud Previsional (ISAPRE) and the market-driven health system, the failed health care reform of the last decade, conflicts of interest in the formulation of public policies, loss of legitimacy of healthcare authorities, and the role of the health professionals in this process. Finally, a discussion arises seeking to regain public trust as a central issue for the future development and sustainability of health policies.",nonCancer
2016,c-Myc targeted regulators of cell metabolism in a transgenic mouse model of papillary lung adenocarcinoma.,"c-Myc's role in pulmonary cancer metabolism is uncertain. We therefore investigated c-Myc activity in papillary lung adenocarcinomas (PLAC). Genomics revealed 90 significantly regulated genes (> 3-fold) coding for cell growth, DNA metabolism, RNA processing and ribosomal biogenesis and bioinformatics defined c-Myc binding sites (TFBS) at > 95% of up-regulated genes. EMSA assays at 33 novel TFBS evidenced DNA binding activity and ChIP-seq data retrieved from public repositories confirmed these to be c-Myc bound. Dual-luciferase gene reporter assays developed for RNA-Terminal-Phosphate-Cyclase-Like-1(RCL1), Ribosomal-Protein-SA(RPSA), Nucleophosmin/Nucleoplasmin-3(NPM3) and Hexokinase-1(HK1) confirmed c-Myc functional relevance and ChIP assays with HEK293T cells over-expressing ectopic c-Myc demonstrated enriched c-Myc occupancy at predicted TFBS for RCL1, NPM3, HK1 and RPSA. Note, c-Myc recruitment on chromatin was comparable to the positive controls CCND2 and CDK4. Computational analyses defined master regulators (MR), i.e. heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1, nucleolin, the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1, triosephosphate-isomerase 1, folate transporter (SLC19A1) and nucleophosmin to influence activity of up to 90% of PLAC-regulated genes. Their expression was induced by 3-, 3-, 6-, 3-, 11- and 7-fold, respectively. STRING analysis confirmed protein-protein-interactions of regulated genes and Western immunoblotting of fatty acid synthase, serine hydroxyl-methyltransferase 1, arginine 1 and hexokinase 2 showed tumor specific induction. Published knock down studies confirmed these proteins to induce apoptosis by disrupting neoplastic lipogenesis, by endorsing uracil accumulation and by suppressing arginine metabolism and glucose-derived ribonucleotide biosynthesis. Finally, translational research demonstrated high expression of MR and of 47 PLAC up-regulated genes to be associated with poor survival in lung adenocarcinoma patients (HR 3.2 p < 0.001) thus, providing a rationale for molecular targeted therapies in PLACs.",nonCancer
774,ASXL1 mutations identify a high-risk subgroup of older patients with primary cytogenetically normal AML within the ELN Favorable genetic category.,"The associations of mutations in the enhancer of trithorax and polycomb family gene ASXL1 with pretreatment patient characteristics, outcomes, and gene-/microRNA-expression profiles in primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) are unknown. We analyzed 423 adult patients for ASXL1 mutations, other prognostic gene mutations, and gene-/microRNA-expression profiles. ASXL1 mutations were 5 times more common in older (≥ 60 years) patients (16.2%) than those younger than 60 years (3.2%; P < .001). Among older patients, ASXL1 mutations associated with wild-type NPM1 (P < .001), absence of FLT3-internal tandem duplications (P = .002), mutated CEBPA (P = .01), and with inferior complete remission (CR) rate (P = .04), disease-free survival (DFS; P = .03), overall survival (OS; P = .006), and event-free survival (EFS; P = .002). Within the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) genetic categories of older CN-AML, ASXL1 mutations associated with inferior CR rate (P = .02), OS (P < .001), and EFS (P < .001) among ELN Favorable, but not among ELN Intermediate-I patients. Multivariable analyses confirmed associations of ASXL1 mutations with unfavorable CR rate (P = .03), DFS (P < .001), OS (P < .001), and EFS (P < .001) among ELN Favorable patients. We identified an ASXL1 mutation-associated gene-expression signature, but no microRNA-expression signature. This first study of ASXL1 mutations in primary CN-AML demonstrates that ASXL1-mutated older patients, particularly within the ELN Favorable group, have unfavorable outcomes and may be candidates for experimental treatment approaches.",cancer

Here, we evaluate the association of B4GALT1 expression with oncologic outcome in patients with non-metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). A retrospective analysis of 438 patients with non-metastatic ccRCC at two academic medical centers between 2005 and 2009 was performed. The first cohort with 207 patients was treated as training cohort and the other as validation cohort. Tissue microarrays (TMAs) were created in triplicate from formalin-fixed, paraffin embedded specimens. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed and the association of B4GALT1 expression with standard pathologic features and prognosis were evaluated. B4GALT1 expression was significantly associated with tumor T stage (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively), Fuhrman grade (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) and necrosis (P=0.021 and P=0.002, respectively) in both training and validation cohorts. And high B4GALT1 expression indicated poor overall survival (OS) (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) in the two cohorts. Furthermore, B4GALT1 expression was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for survival (P=0.007 and P=0.002, respectively). Moreover, the accuracy of established prognostic models was improved when B4GALT1 expression was added. Therefore, a predictive nomogram was generated with identified independent prognosticators to assess patients' OS at 5 and 10 years. Increased B4GALT1 expression is a potential independent adverse prognostic factor for OS in patients with non-metastatic ccRCC.",cancer
1834,"Correction of Tibial Torsion in Children With Cerebral Palsy by Isolated Distal Tibia Rotation Osteotomy: A Short-term, In Vivo Anatomic Study.","Excessive internal or external tibial torsion is frequently present in children with cerebral palsy. Several surgical techniques have been described to correct excessive tibial torsion, including isolated distal tibial rotation osteotomy (TRO). The anatomic changes surrounding this technique are poorly understood. The goal of the study was to examine the anatomic relationship between the tibia and fibula following isolated distal TRO in children with cerebral palsy.|Twenty patients with 29 limbs were prospectively entered for study. CT scans of the proximal and distal tibiofibular (TF) articulations were obtained preoperatively, at 6 weeks, and 1 year postoperatively. Measurements of tibia and fibula torsion were performed at each interval. Qualitative assessments of proximal and distal TF joint congruency were also performed.|The subjects with internal tibia torsion (ITT, 19 limbs) showed significant torsional changes for the tibia between preoperative, postoperative, and 1 year time points (mean torsion 13.21, 31.05, 34.84 degrees, respectively). Measurement of fibular torsion in the ITT treatment group also showed significant differences between time points (mean -36.77, -26.77, -18.54 degrees, respectively). Proximal and distal TF joints remained congruent at all time points in the study.Subjects with external tibia torsion (ETT, 10 limbs) showed significant differences between preoperative and postoperative tibial torsion, but not between postoperative and 1 year (mean torsion 54, 19.3, 23.3 degrees, respectively). Measurement of fibular torsion in the ETT treatment group did not change significantly between preoperative and postoperative, but did change significantly between postoperative and 1 year (mean torsion -9.8,-16.9, -30.7 degrees, respectively). Nine of 10 proximal TF joints were found to be subluxated at 6 weeks postoperatively. At 1 year, all 9 of these joints had reduced.|Correction of ITT by isolated distal tibial external rotation osteotomy resulted in acute external fibular torsion. The fibular torsion alignment remodeled over time to accommodate the corrected tibial torsional alignment and reduce the strain associated with the plastic deformity of the fibula. Correction of ETT by isolated distal internal TRO resulted in acute subluxation of the proximal TF articulation in almost all cases. Subsequent torsional remodeling of the fibula resulted in correction of the TF subluxation in all cases. Acute correction of TT by isolated distal TRO occurs by distinct mechanisms, based upon the direction of rotational correction.|Level II-Diagnostic.",nonCancer

Its mechanism of action includes oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, and inhibition of the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE). The aim of the present study is to investigate CPF toxicity in mature and immature cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs), as well as its effect on glutamate induced excitotoxicity.|This study was an in vitro experimental study performed on mice cultured CGNs. Immature and mature neurons were exposed to different concentrations of CPF (1-1000 µM) and glutamate (10-600 µM) for 48 hours after which we used the MTT assay to measure cytotoxicity. Immature neurons had exposure to CPF for 5 days in order to evaluate the cytotoxic effect on developing neurons. Mature neurons received sub-lethal concentrations of CPF (10, 100 µM) combined with different concentrations of glutamate. AChE activity and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were assessed after treatments.|Immature CGNs had increased sensitivity to CPF toxicity compared to mature neurons. We observed significantly greater ROS production in immature compared to mature neurons, however AChE activity was more inhibited in mature neurons. Although CPF toxicity was not well correlated with AChE inhibition, it correlated well with ROS production. Glutamate toxicity was potentiated by sub-lethal concentration of CPF, however glutamate induced ROS production was not affected. The results suggested that CPF potentiated glutamate toxicity by mechanisms other than oxidative stress.|CPF toxicity differed in mature and immature neurons. Potentiated glutamate toxicity by CPF implied that CPF exposure might be a risk factor for neurodegenerative disease.",nonCancer

Here we report the tomographic mapping of dopants in layered 2D materials with atomic sensitivity and sub-nanometer spatial resolution using atom probe tomography (APT). APT analysis shows that Ag dopes both Bi2Se3 and PbSe layers in (PbSe)5(Bi2Se3)3, and correlations in the position of Ag atoms suggest a pairing across neighboring Bi2Se3 and PbSe layers. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm the favorability of substitutional doping for both Pb and Bi, and provide insights into the observed spatial correlations in dopant locations.",nonCancer

Lamins interact with a large number of binding partners including proteins of the nuclear envelope but also chromatin-associated factors. Lamins not only constitute a scaffold for nuclear shape, rigidity and resistance to stress but also contribute to the organization of chromatin and chromosomal domains. We will discuss here the impact of A-type Lamins loss on alterations of chromatin organization and formation of chromatin domains and how disorganization of the lamina contributes to the patho-physiology of premature aging syndromes.",nonCancer
1034,Acquired METD1228V Mutation and Resistance to MET Inhibition in Lung Cancer.,"Amplified and/or mutated MET can act as both a primary oncogenic driver and as a promoter of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the landscape of MET-specific targeting agents remains underdeveloped, and understanding of mechanisms of resistance to MET TKIs is limited. Here, we present a case of a patient with lung adenocarcinoma harboring both a mutation in EGFR and an amplification of MET, who after progression on erlotinib responded dramatically to combined MET and EGFR inhibition with savolitinib and osimertinib. When resistance developed to this combination, a new MET kinase domain mutation, D1228V, was detected. Our in vitro findings demonstrate that MET(D1228V) induces resistance to type I MET TKIs through impaired drug binding, while sensitivity to type II MET TKIs is maintained. Based on these findings, the patient was treated with erlotinib combined with cabozantinib, a type II MET inhibitor, and exhibited a response. With several structurally distinct MET inhibitors undergoing development for treatment of NSCLC, it is critical to identify mechanism-based therapies for drug resistance. We demonstrate that an acquired MET(D1228V) mutation mediates resistance to type I, but not type II, MET inhibitors, having therapeutic implications for the clinical use of sequential MET inhibitors.

1858,Circadian Contrasts in Heart Rate Variability Associated With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in a Young Adult Cohort.,"Prior research has demonstrated that individuals exposed to trauma have shown impaired autonomic function. We sought to determine if heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of impaired autonomic function, differed across periods of wake, rest, and sleep as a function of the level of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A sample of young adults (N = 209), 95 of whom met full criteria for current PTSD based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), were evaluated for ≈ 24 hr using actigraphy and electrocardiogram. Actigraphy data were categorized as active, rest, or sleep. Multilevel modeling analyses showed that individuals with high PTSD symptom severity had lower high-frequency HRV than individuals with low PTSD symptom severity during periods of sleep, t(1083) = 2.20, p = .028, Cohen's d = 0.12. No differences were found during periods of activity, t(1083) = 1.34, p = .499, d = 0.05, or rest, t(1083) = 1.34, p = .180, d = 0.09. Our findings extended the import of prior studies to suggest that those with elevated PTSD symptoms may have decreased parasympathetic control during sleep. Moreover, relative to periods of wake and rest, sleep may represent a state of increased vulnerability for decreased parasympathetic cardiac control. Individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms may benefit from early screening for detection of cardiovascular disease.",nonCancer
362,Human papillomavirus and survival of patients with oropharyngeal cancer.,"Oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinomas caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with favorable survival, but the independent prognostic significance of tumor HPV status remains unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of the association between tumor HPV status and survival among patients with stage III or IV oropharyngeal squamous-cell carcinoma who were enrolled in a randomized trial comparing accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy (with acceleration by means of concomitant boost radiotherapy) with standard-fractionation radiotherapy, each combined with cisplatin therapy, in patients with squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Proportional-hazards models were used to compare the risk of death among patients with HPV-positive cancer and those with HPV-negative cancer. The median follow-up period was 4.8 years. The 3-year rate of overall survival was similar in the group receiving accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy and the group receiving standard-fractionation radiotherapy (70.3% vs. 64.3%; P=0.18; hazard ratio for death with accelerated-fractionation radiotherapy, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.72 to 1.13), as were the rates of high-grade acute and late toxic events. A total of 63.8% of patients with oropharyngeal cancer (206 of 323) had HPV-positive tumors; these patients had better 3-year rates of overall survival (82.4%, vs. 57.1% among patients with HPV-negative tumors; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and, after adjustment for age, race, tumor and nodal stage, tobacco exposure, and treatment assignment, had a 58% reduction in the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.27 to 0.66). The risk of death significantly increased with each additional pack-year of tobacco smoking. Using recursive-partitioning analysis, we classified our patients as having a low, intermediate, or high risk of death on the basis of four factors: HPV status, pack-years of tobacco smoking, tumor stage, and nodal stage. Tumor HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival among patients with oropharyngeal cancer. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00047008.)",cancer
1979,Droplet digital PCR to investigate quasi-species at codons 119 and 275 of the A(H1N1)pdm09 neuraminidase during zanamivir and oseltamivir therapies.,"The H275Y and E119D neuraminidase (NA) mutations constitute important molecular markers of resistance to NA inhibitors in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses. We used reverse transcriptase-droplet digital PCR amplification (RT-ddPCR) to analyze quasi-species at codons 275 and 119 of the NA in A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses recovered from an immuncompromised patient who received oseltamivir and zanamivir therapies. RT-ddPCR assays detected and quantified H275Y and E119D mutations with an efficiency that was comparable to that of high throughput sequencing (HiSeq 2500 Illumina) technology. With its sensitivity and reproducibility, RT-ddPCR could be a reliable method for accurate detection and quantification of major NAI-resistance mutations in clinical settings.

155,"Relationship between EGFR expression, EGFR mutation status, and the efficacy of chemotherapy plus cetuximab in FLEX study patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer.","The phase III FLEX study (NCT00148798) in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer indicated that the survival benefit associated with the addition of cetuximab to cisplatin and vinorelbine was limited to patients whose tumors expressed high levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (immunohistochemistry score of ≥200; scale 0-300). We assessed whether the treatment effect was also modulated in FLEX study patients by tumor EGFR mutation status. A tumor mutation screen of EGFR exons 18 to 21 included 971 of 1125 (86%) FLEX study patients. Treatment outcome in low and high EGFR expression groups was analyzed across efficacy endpoints according to tumor EGFR mutation status. Mutations in EGFR exons 18 to 21 were detected in 133 of 971 tumors (14%), 970 of which were also evaluable for EGFR expression level. The most common mutations were exon 19 deletions and L858R (124 of 133 patients; 93%). In the high EGFR expression group (immunohistochemistry score of ≥200), a survival benefit for the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy was demonstrated in patients with EGFR wild-type (including T790M mutant) tumors. Although patient numbers were small, those in the high EGFR expression group whose tumors carried EGFR mutations may also have derived a survival benefit from the addition of cetuximab to chemotherapy. Response data suggested a cetuximab benefit in the high EGFR expression group regardless of EGFR mutation status. The survival benefit associated with the addition of cetuximab to first-line chemotherapy for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer expressing high levels of EGFR is not limited by EGFR mutation status.",cancer
442,Aurora-A contributes to cisplatin resistance and lymphatic metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer and predicts poor prognosis.,"Platinum-based chemotherapy improves survival among patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the efficiency is limited due to resistance. In this study, we aimed to identify the expression of Aurora-A and its correlation with cisplatin resistance and prognosis in NSCLC. We used immunohistochemical analysis to determine the expression of Aurora-A protein in 102 NSCLC patients treated by surgery and adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The prognostic significances were assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox models. The potential role of Aurora-A in the regulation of cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells was examined by transfections using expression vector and small interfering RNA or using small-molecule inhibitors. Aurora-A expression was significantly associated with clinical stage (p = 0.018), lymph node metastasis (p = 0.038) and recurrence (p = 0.005), and was an independent prognostic parameter in multivariate analysis. High level of Aurora-A expression predicted poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). In vitro data showed that Aurora-A expression was elevated in cisplatin-resistant lung cancer cells, and overexpression or knockdown of Aurora-A resulted in increased or decreased cellular resistance to cisplatin. Furthermore, inhibition of Aurora-A reversed the migration ability of cisplatin-resistant cells. The current findings suggest that high Aurora-A expression is correlated with cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic resistance and predicts poor patient survival in NSCLC. Aurora-A might serve as a predictive biomarker of drug response and therapeutic target to reverse chemotherapy resistance.",cancer
2083,Tributyltin exposure alters cytokine levels in mouse serum.,"Tributyltin (TBT), a toxic environmental contaminant, has been widely utilized for various industrial, agricultural and household purposes. Its usage has led to a global contamination and its bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms and terrestrial mammals. Previous studies suggest that TBT has debilitating effects on the overall immune function of animals, rendering them more vulnerable to diseases. TBT (at concentrations that have been detected in human blood) alters secretion of inflammatory cytokines from human lymphocytes ex vivo. Thus, it is important to determine if specified levels of TBT can alter levels of cytokines in an in vivo system. Mice were exposed to biologically relevant concentrations of TBT (200, 100 or 25 nM final concentrations). The quantitative determination of interferon (IFN)-γ, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL2, IL5, IL7, IL12βp40, IL13, IL15, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein 1β (MIP), MIP2 and regulated on activation normal T-cell-expressed and secreted (RANTES) was performed in mouse sera by MAGPIX analysis and Western blot. Results indicated alterations (both decreases and increases) in several cytokines. The pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL5, IL12βp40 and IL-15 were altered as were the chemokines MIP-1 and RANTES and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13. Increases in IFNγ and TNFα were seen in the serum of mice exposed to TBT for less than 24 h. Levels of IL1β, IL-12 βp40, IL-5 and IL-15 were also modulated in mouse serum, depending on the specific experiment and exposure level. IL-2 was consistently decreased in mouse serum when animals were exposed to TBT. There were also TBT-induced increases in MIP-1β, RANTES and IL-13. These results from human and murine samples clearly suggest that TBT exposures modulate the secretion inflammatory cytokines.",nonCancer
78,Prognostic impact of FLT3-ITD load in NPM1 mutated acute myeloid leukemia.,"High FLT3-ITD/wildtype (wt) load in FLT3-ITD-mutated AML has been associated with adverse impact on outcome in several studies. To clarify whether FLT3-ITD load as expressed as FLT3-ITD/wt ratio is also relevant in patients with NPM1 mutated AML, we assessed the FLT3-ITD mutation status and FLT3-ITD/wt ratio by fragment analysis in 638 NPM1mut AML (339 females; 299 males; 17.8-88.0 years), and analyzed its prognostic relevance in 355 patients. FLT3-ITD of various length and load were detected in 243/638 cases (38.1%). Median EFS (19.3 vs 9.7 months, P<0.001) and median 2-year survival rate (72.0 vs 52.7%, P=0.006) was better in FLT3wt (n=212 with available follow-up data) than FLT3-ITD (n=143). A higher FLT3-ITD/wt ratio as continuous variable was correlated with a shorter EFS (P=0.028). When patients were separated into subgroups according to the FLT3-ITD mutation load, only a FLT3-ITD/wt ratio 0.5 conferred an independent adverse impact on EFS and OS, and retained its prognostic significance also in multivariate analysis (P=0.009 for EFS, P=0.008 for OS). In conclusion, for risk estimation in NPM1 mutated AML not only the FLT3-ITD status, but also the FLT3-ITD load has to be taken into account. These data might contribute to clinical decision making in AML.",cancer
886,MET-Driven Resistance to Dual EGFR and BRAF Blockade May Be Overcome by Switching from EGFR to MET Inhibition in BRAF-Mutated Colorectal Cancer.,"A patient with metastatic BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer initially responded to combined EGFR and BRAF inhibition with panitumumab plus vemurafenib. Pre-existing cells with increased MET gene copy number in the archival tumor tissue likely underwent clonal expansion during treatment, leading to the emergence of MET amplification in the rebiopsy taken at progression. In BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer cells, ectopic expression of MET conferred resistance to panitumumab and vemurafenib, which was overcome by combining BRAF and MET inhibition. Based on tumor genotyping and functional in vitro data, the patient was treated with the dual ALK-MET inhibitor crizotinib plus vemurafenib, thus switching to dual MET and BRAF blockade, with rapid and marked effectiveness of such strategy. Although acquired resistance is a major limitation to the clinical efficacy of anticancer agents, the identification of molecular targets emerging during the first treatment may afford the opportunity to design the next line of targeted therapies, maximizing patient benefit. MET amplification is here identified-clinically and preclinically-as a new mechanism of resistance to EGFR and BRAF dual/triple block combinations in BRAF-mutated colorectal cancer. Switching from EGFR to MET inhibition, while maintaining BRAF inhibition, resulted in clinical benefit after the occurrence of MET-driven acquired resistance.

1494,How Climate Change Beliefs among U.S. Teachers Do and Do Not Translate to Students.,"Research suggests climate change beliefs among science teachers mirror those of the general public, raising questions of whether teachers may be perpetuating polarization of public opinion through their classrooms. We began answering these questions with a survey of middle school science teachers (n = 24) and their students (n = 369) in North Carolina, USA. Similar to previous studies, we found that though nearly all (92.1%) of students had teachers who believe that global warming is happening, few (12%) are in classrooms with teachers who recognize that global warming is anthropogenic. We found that teacher beliefs that global warming is happening and student climate change knowledge were the strongest predictors of student belief that global warming is happening and human caused. Conversely, teacher beliefs about human causes of global warming had no relationship with student beliefs, suggesting that science teachers' low recognition of the causes of global warming is not necessarily problematic in terms of student outcomes. These findings may be explained by previous research suggesting adolescents interpret scientific information relatively independently of ideological constraints. Though teacher polarization may be problematic in its own right, it appears that as long as climate change information is presented in classrooms, students deduce anthropogenic causes.",nonCancer
1675,The impact of general/visceral obesity on completion of mesorectum and perioperative outcomes of laparoscopic TME for rectal cancer: A STARD-compliant article.,"To evaluate the impact of visceral obesity on laparoscopic total mesorectal excision (TME) and decide the best index to reflect completion of mesorectum and perioperative outcomes.Patients with rectal cancer who underwent laparoscopic TME were enrolled. The data including body mass index (BMI), visceral fat area (VFA), visceral fat area/body surface area (VFA/BSA), mesorectum fat ratio (MFR), pelvic fat area (PFA), pelvic fat ratio (PFR), completion of mesorectum, and other perioperative outcomes were collected. Data were analyzed.A total of 322 patients were enrolled between 2011 and 2014. There was no significantly difference between the BMI groups on completion of mesorectum and other outcomes (P ≥ 0.05). However, in VFA groups, completion of mesorectum (P = 0.002), operative time (P = 0.02), and incision length (P = 0.02) were significantly different. In VFA/BSA groups, completion of mesorectum (P = 0.002) and incision length (P = 0.009) were significantly different. When MFR was equal to 0.48, completion of mesorectum (P = 0.002), operative time (P = 0.001), incision length (P = 0.03), and blood loss (P = 0.04) were significantly different between the 2 groups. In PFA and PFR groups, there was no significantly difference (P ≥ 0.05). After the analysis of logistic regression, only VFA was the risk factor of incomplete mesorectum excision.BMI does not reflect the impact of obesity on laparoscopic rectal surgery. VFA is a better index in predicting the influence of visceral obesity on surgical quality and difficulty of laparoscopic rectal surgery than VFA/BSA and MFR.",nonCancer
507,EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker for patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitor treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis in non-small-cell lung cancer.,"We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene copy number as a potential biomarker of survival for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) receiving single-agent treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We systematically identified articles investigating EGFR gene copy number by fluorescent or chromogenic in situ hybridization in patients with advanced or recurrent NSCLC treated with the TKIs erlotinib or gefitinib, (last search: 31 June 2009). Eligible studies had to report on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) or time-to-progression (TTP), stratified by EGFR gene copy number. Summary hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using random-effects models. Among 255 identified studies, 20 (1689 patients, 594 with increased gene copy number), 10 (822 patients, 290 with increased gene copy number) and 5 (294 patients, 129 with increased gene copy number) were eligible for the OS, PFS and TTP meta-analyses, respectively. Increased EGFR gene copy number was associated with increased OS (HR = 0.77; 95% CI 0.66-0.89; P = 0.001), PFS (HR = 0.60; 95% CI 0.46-0.79; P<0.001) and TTP (HR = 0.50; 95% CI 0.28-0.91; P = 0.02). Among predominantly white populations, increased EGFR gene copy number was strongly associated with improved survival (HR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.59-0.82; P<0.001), whereas it did not influence survival in East Asians (HR = 1.11; 95% CI 0.82-1.50; P=0.50). This difference was statistically significant (P=0.02). Among TKI-treated patients, increased EGFR gene copy number appears to be associated with improved survival outcomes. The effect on OS appears to be limited to patients of non-Asian descent.",cancer
2122,Two years of unintended consequences: introducing an electronic health record system in a hospice in Scotland.,"The aim of the study was to explore the impact of implementing an electronic health record system on staff at a Scottish hospice.|Electronic health records are broadly considered preferable to paper based systems. However, changing from one system to the other is difficult. This study analysed the impact of this change in a Scottish hospice.|Naturalistic prospective repeated measures mixed methods approach.|Data on the usability of the system, staff engagement and staff experience were obtained at four time points spanning 30 months from inception. Quantitative data were obtained from surveys, qualitative from Concurrent Analysis of free text comments and focus group. Participants were all 150 employees of a single hospice in Scotland.|Both system usability and staff engagement scores decreased for the first two years before recovering at 30 months. Staff experience data pointed to two main challenges: 1.Technical issues, with subthemes of accessibility and usability. 2.Cultural issues, with subthemes of time, teamwork, care provision and perception of change.|It took 30 months for system usability and staff engagement scores to rise, after falling significantly for the first two years. The unintended outcomes of implementation included challenges to the way the patient story was both recorded and communicated. Nevertheless this process of change was found to be consistent with the 'J curve' theory of organizational change, and as such is both predictable and manageable for other organizations.|It is known that implementing an electronic health record system is complex.

1151,PIK3CA mutations predict local recurrences in rectal cancer patients.,"Identifying rectal cancer patients at risk for local recurrence would allow for refinement in the selection of patients who would benefit from preoperative radiotherapy. PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutations are commonly found in colon cancers, but their prevalence has not been clearly assessed in rectal cancer. In this study, we aim to determine the mutation frequencies of PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF and to investigate whether a mutation may be used as a prognostic parameter in rectal cancer patients. We evaluated DNA mutations in PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF in 240 stage I to III rectal tumors obtained from nonirradiated patients from the Dutch Total Mesorectal Excision trial. PIK3CA, KRAS, and BRAF mutations were identified in 19 (7.9%), 81 (33.9%), and 5 (2.1%) rectal cancers. Patients with PIK3CA mutations developed more local recurrences (5-year risks, 27.8% versus 9.4%; P = 0.006) and tended to develop these recurrences more rapidly after surgery (median local recurrence-free interval since surgery: 7.9 versus 19.6 months; P = 0.07) than patients without PIK3CA mutations. In multivariate analysis, PIK3CA mutations remained as an independent predictor for the development of local recurrences (hazard ratio, 3.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-9.2; P = 0.017), next to tumor-node-metastasis stage. PIK3CA mutations can be used as a biomarker in identifying rectal cancer patients with an increased risk for local recurrences. Currently, our findings suggest that prospective evaluation of PIK3CA mutation status could reduce overtreatment by preoperative radiotherapy for the low-risk patients who might otherwise only experience the side effects.",cancer

The therapeutic impact of somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in other homologous recombination DNA repair genes is uncertain. Using targeted capture and massively parallel genomic sequencing, we assessed 390 ovarian carcinomas for germline and somatic loss-of-function mutations in 30 genes, including BRCA1, BRCA2, and 11 other genes in the homologous recombination pathway. Thirty-one percent of ovarian carcinomas had a deleterious germline (24%) and/or somatic (9%) mutation in one or more of the 13 homologous recombination genes: BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CHEK1, CHEK2, FAM175A, MRE11A, NBN, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D. Nonserous ovarian carcinomas had similar rates of homologous recombination mutations to serous carcinomas (28% vs. 31%, P = 0.6), including clear cell, endometrioid, and carcinosarcoma. The presence of germline and somatic homologous recombination mutations was highly predictive of primary platinum sensitivity (P = 0.0002) and improved overall survival (P = 0.0006), with a median overall survival of 66 months in germline homologous recombination mutation carriers, 59 months in cases with a somatic homologous recombination mutation, and 41 months for cases without a homologous recombination mutation. Germline or somatic mutations in homologous recombination genes are present in almost one third of ovarian carcinomas, including both serous and nonserous histologies. Somatic BRCA1/2 mutations and mutations in other homologous recombination genes have a similar positive impact on overall survival and platinum responsiveness as germline BRCA1/2 mutations. The similar rate of homologous recombination mutations in nonserous carcinomas supports their inclusion in PARP inhibitor clinical trials.",cancer
2455,Emodin mitigates the oxidative stress induced by cisplatin in osteosarcoma MG63 cells.,"Previously, the application of cisplatin in chemotherapy was limited due to the significant side effects on normal cell growth. In the present study, the concomitant application of emodin with cisplatin was demonstrated to ameliorate cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and markedly suppress tumor cell proliferation for the first time. Human osteosarcoma MG-63 cells were treated with cisplatin alone or in combination with emodin. The cell viability was determined by MTS assays and the augmentation of reactive oxygen species were determined by fluorogenic probes; in addition, a stable MG-63 subline bearing antioxidant response element (ARE)-driven luciferase expression was developed to monitor the activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-ARE signaling pathway. The results indicated that cisplatin or emodin may inhibit MG-63 cell proliferation in a time- or dose-dependent manner, respectively. Concomitant treatment with cisplatin and emodin demonstrated synergic anti-tumor effects. Cisplatin augmented reactive oxygen species in the MG-63 cells, followed by the translocation of Nrf2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, which triggered ARE-driven luciferase expression. The addition of emodin diminished the previously described phenomenon, resulting in decreased ROS augmentation, translocation of Nrf2 and ARE-driven luciferase activity. In conclusion, emodin could ameliorate cisplatin-induced oxidative stress and protect the cells from oxidative stress-induced damage. The findings of the present study provide a novel strategy for the treatment of osteosarcoma using emodin and cisplatin.",nonCancer
655,TP53 mutational status is predictive of pazopanib response in advanced sarcomas.,"To investigate whether TP53 DNA mutational status impacts progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced sarcomas (soft tissue sarcoma) treated with vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) inhibition. We retrospectively reviewed 19 cases of patients treated at the Ohio State James Comprehensive Cancer Center with advanced sarcoma treated with VEGFR inhibition who also had next-generation sequencing of their tumors (via FoundationOne Heme panel). We evaluated TP53 as well as mutations that were observed in at least 20% of patients and evaluated its contribution to PFS using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of available radiology end points. Mutations that were observed in at least 20% of patients included TP53 and Rb1. Only TP53 was predictive of PFS in the context of VEGFR inhibition. The PFS of patients with TP53 mutations was significantly greater than TP53 wild-type tumors with the median PFS of 208 versus 136 days, respectively [P = 0.036, hazards ratio 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.09-0.83)]. Mutations in TP53 may serve as a predictive biomarker of response to VEGFR inhibition in patients with advanced sarcoma. Larger, prospective studies are necessary to confirm these findings.",cancer
2299,Probing the origins of human acetylcholinesterase inhibition via QSAR modeling and molecular docking.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease which leads to the gradual loss of neuronal cells. Several hypotheses for AD exists (e.g., cholinergic, amyloid, tau hypotheses, etc.). As per the cholinergic hypothesis, the deficiency of choline is responsible for AD; therefore, the inhibition of AChE is a lucrative therapeutic strategy for the treatment of AD. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an enzyme that catalyzes the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine that is essential for cognition and memory. A large non-redundant data set of 2,570 compounds with reported IC50 values against AChE was obtained from ChEMBL and employed in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study so as to gain insights on their origin of bioactivity. AChE inhibitors were described by a set of 12 fingerprint descriptors and predictive models were constructed from 100 different data splits using random forest. Generated models afforded R (2), [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values in ranges of 0.66-0.93, 0.55-0.79 and 0.56-0.81 for the training set, 10-fold cross-validated set and external set, respectively. The best model built using the substructure count was selected according to the OECD guidelines and it afforded R (2), [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] values of 0.92 ± 0.01, 0.78 ± 0.06 and 0.78 ± 0.05, respectively. Furthermore, Y-scrambling was applied to evaluate the possibility of chance correlation of the predictive model. Subsequently, a thorough analysis of the substructure fingerprint count was conducted to provide informative insights on the inhibitory activity of AChE inhibitors. Moreover, Kennard-Stone sampling of the actives were applied to select 30 diverse compounds for further molecular docking studies in order to gain structural insights on the origin of AChE inhibition. Site-moiety mapping of compounds from the diversity set revealed three binding anchors encompassing both hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interaction. Molecular docking revealed that compounds 13, 5 and 28 exhibited the lowest binding energies of -12.2, -12.0 and -12.0 kcal/mol, respectively, against human AChE, which is modulated by hydrogen bonding, π-π stacking and hydrophobic interaction inside the binding pocket. These information may be used as guidelines for the design of novel and robust AChE inhibitors.",nonCancer
201,Novel mutations of androgen receptor: a possible mechanism of bicalutamide withdrawal syndrome.,"Most prostate cancers (PCs) become resistant to combined androgen blockade therapy with surgical or medical castration and antiandrogens after several years. Some of these refractory PCs regress after discontinuation of antiandrogen administration [antiandrogen withdrawal syndrome (AWS)]. Although the molecular mechanisms of the AWS are not fully understood because of the lack of suitable experimental models, one hypothesis of the mechanism is mutation of androgen receptor (AR). However, bicalutamide, which has become the most prevalent pure antiandrogen, does not work as an agonist for any mutant AR detected thus far in PC. To elucidate the mechanisms of the AWS, we established and characterized novel LNCaP cell sublines, LNCaP-cxDs, which were generated in vitro by culturing androgen-dependent LNCaP-FGC human PC cells in androgen-depleted medium with bicalutamide to mimic the combined androgen blockade therapy. LNCaP-FGC cells did not grow at first, but they started to grow after 6-13 weeks of culture. Bicalutamide stimulated LNCaP-cxD cell growth and increased prostate-specific antigen secretion from LNCaP-cxD cells both in vitro and in vivo. Sequencing of AR transcripts revealed that the AR in LNCaP-cxD cells harbors a novel mutation in codon 741, TGG (tryptophan) to TGT (cysteine; W741C), or in codon 741, TGG to TTG (leucine; W741L), in the ligand-binding domain. Transactivation assays showed that bicalutamide worked as an agonist for both W741C and W741L mutant ARs. Importantly, another antiandrogen, hydroxyflutamide, worked as an antagonist for these mutant ARs. In summary, we demonstrate for the first time that within only 6-13 weeks of in vitro exposure to bicalutamide, LNCaP-FGC cells, whose growth had initially been suppressed, came to use bicalutamide as an AR agonist via W741 AR mutation to survive. Our data strongly support the hypothesis that AR mutation is one possible mechanism of the AWS and suggest that flutamide might be effective as a second-line therapy for refractory PC previously treated with bicalutamide.",cancer
2210,Extreme Dysbiosis of the Microbiome in Critical Illness.,"Critical illness is hypothesized to associate with loss of ""health-promoting"" commensal microbes and overgrowth of pathogenic bacteria (dysbiosis). This dysbiosis is believed to increase susceptibility to nosocomial infections, sepsis, and organ failure. A trial with prospective monitoring of the intensive care unit (ICU) patient microbiome using culture-independent techniques to confirm and characterize this dysbiosis is thus urgently needed. Characterizing ICU patient microbiome changes may provide first steps toward the development of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions using microbiome signatures. To characterize the ICU patient microbiome, we collected fecal, oral, and skin samples from 115 mixed ICU patients across four centers in the United States and Canada. Samples were collected at two time points: within 48 h of ICU admission, and at ICU discharge or on ICU day 10. Sample collection and processing were performed according to Earth Microbiome Project protocols. We applied SourceTracker to assess the source composition of ICU patient samples by using Qiita, including samples from the American Gut Project (AGP), mammalian corpse decomposition samples, childhood (Global Gut study), and house surfaces. Our results demonstrate that critical illness leads to significant and rapid dysbiosis. Many taxons significantly depleted from ICU patients versus AGP healthy controls are key ""health-promoting"" organisms, and overgrowth of known pathogens was frequent. Source compositions of ICU patient samples are largely uncharacteristic of the expected community type. Between time points and within a patient, the source composition changed dramatically. Our initial results show great promise for microbiome signatures as diagnostic markers and guides to therapeutic interventions in the ICU to repopulate the normal, ""health-promoting"" microbiome and thereby improve patient outcomes. IMPORTANCE Critical illness may be associated with the loss of normal, ""health promoting"" bacteria, allowing overgrowth of disease-promoting pathogenic bacteria (dysbiosis), which, in turn, makes patients susceptible to hospital-acquired infections, sepsis, and organ failure. This has significant world health implications, because sepsis is becoming a leading cause of death worldwide, and hospital-acquired infections contribute to significant illness and increased costs. Thus, a trial that monitors the ICU patient microbiome to confirm and characterize this hypothesis is urgently needed. Our study analyzed the microbiomes of 115 critically ill subjects and demonstrated rapid dysbiosis from unexpected environmental sources after ICU admission. These data may provide the first steps toward defining targeted therapies that correct potentially ""illness-promoting"" dysbiosis with probiotics or with targeted, multimicrobe synthetic ""stool pills"" that restore a healthy microbiome in the ICU setting to improve patient outcomes.",nonCancer
1402,Progress in piezo-phototronic effect modulated photovoltaics.,"Wurtzite structured materials, like ZnO, GaN, CdS, and InN, simultaneously possess semiconductor and piezoelectric properties. The inner-crystal piezopotential induced by external strain can effectively tune/control the carrier generation, transport and separation/combination processes at the metal-semiconductor contact or p-n junction, which is called the piezo-phototronic effect. This effect can efficiently enhance the performance of photovoltaic devices based on piezoelectric semiconductor materials by utilizing the piezo-polarization charges at the junction induced by straining, which can modulate the energy band of the piezoelectric material and then accelerate or prevent the separation process of the photon-generated electrons and vacancies. This paper introduces the fundamental physics principles of the piezo-phototronic effect, and reviews recent progress in piezo-phototronic effect enhanced solar cells, including solar cells based on semiconductor nanowire, organic/inorganic materials, quantum dots, and perovskite. The piezo-phototronic effect is suggested as a suitable basis for the development of an innovative method to enhance the performance of solar cells based on piezoelectric semiconductors by applied extrinsic strains, which might be appropriate for fundamental research and potential applications in various areas of optoelectronics.",nonCancer
2124,Association Between Hospital Admission Risk Profile Score and Skilled Nursing or Acute Rehabilitation Facility Discharges in Hospitalized Older Adults.,"To evaluate whether the Hospital Admission Risk Profile (HARP) score is associated with skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation facility discharge after an acute hospitalization.|Retrospective cohort study.|Inpatient unit of a rural academic medical center.|Hospitalized individuals aged 70 and older from October 1, 2013 to June 1, 2014.|Participant age at the time of admission, modified Folstein Mini-Mental State Examination score, and self-reported instrumental activities of daily living 2 weeks before admission were used to calculate HARP score. The primary predictor was HARP score, and the primary outcome was discharge disposition (home, facility, deceased). Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate the association between HARP score and discharge disposition, adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities, and length of stay.|Four hundred twenty-eight individuals admitted from home were screened and their HARP scores were categorized as low (n = 162, 37.8%), intermediate (n = 157, 36.7%), or high (n = 109, 25.5%). Participants with high HARP scores were significantly more likely to be discharged to a facility (55%) than those with low HARP scores (20%) (P < .001). After adjustment, participants with high HARP scores were more than four times as likely as those with low scores to be discharged to a facility (odds ratio = 4.58, 95% confidence interval = 2.42-8.66).|In a population of older hospitalized adults, HARP score (using readily available admission information) identifies individuals at greater risk of skilled nursing or acute rehabilitation facility discharge. Early identification for potential facility discharges may allow for targeted interventions to prevent functional decline, improve informed shared decision-making about post-acute care needs, and expedite discharge planning.",nonCancer
1448,Optic Nerve Head Morphology in Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy Compared to Open-Angle Glaucoma.,"To compare optic nerve head (ONH) morphology of optic nerve atrophy between eyes with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and eyes with a history of nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic atrophy (NAION) using enhanced depth imaging (EDI) with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).|In this cross-sectional study, 121 eyes of 91 patients consisted of moderate to severe POAG (n = 32 eyes), visual field mean deviation-matched NAION (n = 30 eyes) and their fellow eyes (n = 30 eyes), and healthy controls (n = 29). The optic discs were scanned using SD-OCT and measurements were obtained using HEYEX software 6.0. Lamina cribrosa (LC) thickness and anterior lamina cribrosa depth (ALD) at three scans (midsuperior, central, and midinferior) were determined and compared. In addition, prelaminar tissue thickness was measured at three points of a single central scan.|There was no significant difference in the visual field mean deviation (MD) between the NAION and POAG groups (P > 0.99), but both groups had a significantly worse MD than the healthy group (P < 0.001). The NAION and POAG groups had similar peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness (P < 0.99). Eyes with POAG had greater ALD and thinner LC than control eyes and NAION eyes in all regions of the ONH (P < 0.001 for both). There was a marked prelaminar tissue thinning in POAG eyes compared to control and NAION eyes (P < 0.001). Lamina cribrosa thickness and ALD of NAION eyes were not different from their fellow eyes and control eyes. Although prelaminar thickness was thinner in NAION eyes compared to their fellow eyes (P = 0.005), it was thicker than in control eyes (P < 0.001).|Despite profound thinning and posterior displacement of LC in POAG, the thickness and position of LC in NAION eyes are similar to those seen in healthy control and their fellow eyes.",nonCancer
1790,Biological Activity of Peptide-conjugated Polyion Complex Matrices Consisting of Alginate and Chitosan.,"Peptide-conjugated polysaccharide matrices using bioactive laminin-derived peptides are useful biomaterials for tissue and cell engineering. Here, we demonstrate an easy handling preparation method for peptide-polysaccharide matrices using polyion complex with both alginate and chitosan. First, aldehyde-alginate was synthesized by oxidization of alginate using NaIO4 , and then, reacted with Cys-peptides. Next, the peptide-alginate solution was added to a chitosan-coated plate, and the peptide-polyion complex matrices (peptide-PCMs) were prepared. The peptide-PCMs using an integrin αvβ3-binding peptide (A99a: ALRGDN, mouse laminin α1 chain 1145-1150) and an integrin α2β1-binding peptide (EF1XmR: RLQLQEGRLHFXFD, X=Nle, mouse laminin α1 chain 2751-2763) showed strong cell attachment activity in a dose-dependent manner. When we examined the effect of various spacers on the biological activity of A99a-PCM, hydrophobic and long spacers enhanced the cell attachment activity. Further, the A99a-PCM with the spacers strongly promoted neurite outgrowth. The polyion complex method is an easy way to obtain insolubilized matrix and is widely applicable for various polysaccharides. The peptide-PCM is useful as a biomaterial for cell and tissue engineering. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer

We aimed to identify the degree of reduction in excess body weight associated with cardiometabolic changes (lipid panel, liver function tests, systolic (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), HgA1C and fasting blood glucose) in overweight and obese children.|We conducted a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Scopus through February 12th, 2015.We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies that evaluated interventions to treat pediatric obesity (medication, surgery, life style and community based interventions) with ≥ 6 month follow up. We used a random effects meta- regression approach to assess the association between BMI/weight and cardiometabolic changes.|We included 42 studies (37 RCTs and 5 cohorts) enrolling 3,807 children (mean age 12.2 years, weight 74.7 kg and BMI 31.7 kg/m(2)). Studies had overall moderate to low risk of bias. A one mmHG decease in SBP was significantly associated with a decrease of 0.16 kg/m(2) (p=0.04) in BMI. A one mg/dl increase in HDL was significantly associated with 0.74 kg decrease in weight (p=0.02). A one mg/dl decrease in triglycerides was significantly associated with 0.1 kg decrease in weight (p=0.03).

Eighty-eight (62%) of these patients had been operated on with radical intention and 54 (38%) with cytoreductive intention. A total of 73 patients (51%) received postoperative targeted therapy. The primary endpoint was cancer-specific survival (CSS).|The 5 year CSS for level of involvement of TT in the renal vein, subdiaphragmatic vena cava and supradiaphragmatic vena cava was 60% (81 patients), 43% (52 patients) and 51% (nine patients), respectively (p = .42). The median CSS for lymph-node involvement was 63 months for patients with no lymph-node involvement but 10 months for patients with lymph-node involvement (p < .01). The median CSS for metastasis status was 63 months for patients with no metastases compared with 18 months for patients with metastases (p < .01).

433,Mislocalization of p27 to the cytoplasm of breast cancer cells confers resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapy.,"As a cell cycle inhibitor and tumor suppressor, p27 is frequently misregulated in human cancers. Increased degradation is the most common mechanism of misregulation, however in some cancers, p27 is mislocalized from its cell cycle inhibitory location in the nucleus, to the cytoplasm. In normal cells cytoplasmic p27 has functions that are distinct from its cell cycle-regulatory nuclear functions. Therefore, an important question is whether localization of p27 to the cytoplasm in tumor cells is primarily a mechanism for cancelling its inhibitory effect on cell proliferation, or whether cytoplasmic p27 has more direct oncogenic actions. To study p27 mislocalization in human cancers we screened a panel of common breast cancer cell lines. We observed that p27 accumulated in the cytoplasm exclusively in cell lines that are Her2+. To address the significance of p27 mislocalization in Her2+ breast cancer cells we interrogated the cellular response to the dual-Her2/EGFR kinase inhibitor, lapatinib. Knockdown of p27 using shRNA sensitized Her2+ cells to lapatinib-induced apoptosis. Moreover, expression of a constitutively cytoplasmic form of p27 (p27ΔNLS) reversed the lapatinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that cytoplasmic p27 contributed to lapatinib resistance in Her2+ breast cancer cells by suppressing apoptosis. Our results suggest that p27 localization may be useful as a predictive biomarker of therapeutic response in patients with Her2+ breast cancers.",cancer
1939,Controlled Dietary Restriction With a Prepackaged Low-Residue Diet Before Colonoscopy Offers Better-Quality Bowel Cleansing and Allows the Use of a Smaller Volume of Purgatives: A Randomized Multicenter Trial.,"Bowel preparation is burdensome, and less-demanding preparation procedures are needed. Few studies have investigated the effects of low-residue diet and prepackaged low-residue diet in combination with low-volume polyethylene glycol-electrolyte lavage solution during colonoscopy preparation.|We compared self-prepared low-residue diets with prepackaged low-residue diets in combination with low-volume polyethylene glycol.|This was a single-blinded, 3-arm, multicenter, randomized controlled trial.|Colonoscopies were conducted in outpatient settings at 3 centers in Taiwan.|The study included 180 patients (age range, 20-75 years) who were scheduled for colonoscopy.|Three groups were compared: group A included self-prepared, 1-day, low-residue diets with a same-day 2.0-L single-dose of polyethylene glycol; group B included prepackaged low-residue diets plus 2.0 L of polyethylene glycol; and group C included prepackaged low-residue diets plus 1.5 L of polyethylene glycol.|The outcome measures were adherence, bowel-cleansing level, and patient satisfaction.|One third of the subjects in group A, but none in the prepackaged low-residue diets groups, violated the dietary restrictions. The proportion of right-segment preparation failure was 15.0%, 1.7%, and 6.7% (p = 0.025). Accordingly, treatment B was superior to A (p = 0.008). Among subjects violating the low-residue diets guideline, the right-segment preparation failure rate was 25%. According to a multivariate analysis, low-residue diet compliance (adjusted OR = 6.55 (95% CI, 1.83-23.43)) and BMI were predictors of right-sided preparation adequacy, but the volume of polyethylene glycol ingested was not a predictor. Compared with group A, a greater proportion of subjects in groups B and C reported satisfaction.|Patients with high BMI and severe constipation were excluded from this study.

Eligible patients had measurable stage III, IV, or recurrent EC. There was no limit on prior therapy although total prior doxorubicin dose was limited to 320 mg/m(2). Tumors were required to have HER2 overexpression (2+ or 3+ immunohistochemical staining) or HER2 amplification (FISH HER2/CEP 17 ratio >2.0). Trastuzumab was administered intravenously at a dose of 4 mg/kg in week 1, then 2 mg/kg weekly until disease progression. The primary endpoint was tumor response. Of the 286 tumors centrally screened by LabCorp, 33 (11.5%) were HER2-amplified. Three of 8 clear (38%) cell carcinomas and 7 of 25 serous carcinomas (28%) screened exhibited HER2 amplification compared with 7% (2/29) of endometrioid adenocarcinomas. HER2 overexpression was correlated with HER2 amplification (r=0.459; p<0.0001). Thirty-four women were enrolled; 1 was excluded (refused treatment); and 18 had tumors with known HER2 amplification. No major tumor responses were observed. Twelve women experienced stable disease, 18 had increasing disease, and 3 were indeterminate for tumor response. Neither HER2 overexpression nor HER2 amplification appeared to be associated with progression-free survival or overall survival. Trastuzumab as a single agent did not demonstrate activity against endometrial carcinomas with HER2 overexpression or HER2 amplification, although full planned accrual of women with HER2 amplified tumors was not achieved due to slow recruitment. Serous and clear cell endometrial carcinomas appear to be more likely to demonstrate HER2 amplification.",cancer

In addition, baseline PICC data were collected on placement indication (e.g., antimicrobial administration), placement setting (hospital vs SNF), and dwell time. Focus groups were then conducted with frontline nurses and unit nurse managers, and semistructured interviews were conducted with SNF administrators to evaluate perceived preparedness for PICC care. Data were analyzed using a descriptive analysis approach.|Variations in documentation were observed during weekly informal interviews and observations. Differences were noted between resident self-reported PICC concerns (quality of life) and those described by frontline nurses. Deficiencies in communication between hospitals and SNFs with respect to device care, date of last dressing change, and PICC removal time were also noted. During focus group sessions, perceived inadequacy of information at the time of care transitions, limited availability of resources to care for PICCs, and gaps in training and education were highlighted as barriers to improving practice and safety.|Practices for PICC care in SNFs can be improved. Multimodal strategies that enhance staff education, improve information exchange during care transitions, and increase resource availability in SNFs appear necessary to enhance PICC care and safety.",nonCancer
2019,MiR-155 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition in hepatocellular carcinoma cells through the activation of PI3K/SGK3/β-catenin signaling pathways.,"Oncogenic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the catalytic subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), occur with high frequency in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The protein kinase Akt is considered to be the primary effector of PI3K, but there is evidence to suggest that serum and glucocorticoid kinase 3 (SGK3) acts in an Akt-independent manner downstream of PI3K. In this report, we found that SGK3 promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduces phosphorylation-dependent degradation of β-catenin in HCC cells. We determined that miR-155, previously shown to promote EMT, stimulates the expression of SGK3 by targeting and repressing P85α, thereby removing its inhibitory effect on PI3K-AKT signaling. These findings suggest that miR-155 promotes EMT and metastatic properties in HCC cells through activation of PI3K/SGK3/β-catenin signaling pathways.",nonCancer
1046,Germline ETV6 mutations in familial thrombocytopenia and hematologic malignancy.,"We report germline missense mutations in ETV6 segregating with the dominant transmission of thrombocytopenia and hematologic malignancy in three unrelated kindreds, defining a new hereditary syndrome featuring thrombocytopenia with susceptibility to diverse hematologic neoplasms. Two variants, p.Arg369Gln and p.Arg399Cys, reside in the highly conserved ETS DNA-binding domain. The third variant, p.Pro214Leu, lies within the internal linker domain, which regulates DNA binding. These three amino acid sites correspond to hotspots for recurrent somatic mutation in malignancies. Functional studies show that the mutations abrogate DNA binding, alter subcellular localization, decrease transcriptional repression in a dominant-negative fashion and impair hematopoiesis. These familial genetic studies identify a central role for ETV6 in hematopoiesis and malignant transformation.

833,The clinical significance of NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations in the UK LRF CLL4 trial.,"NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations have been previously reported to have prognostic significance in chronic lymphocytic leukemia but to date they have not been validated in a prospective, controlled clinical trial. We have assessed the impact of these mutations in a cohort of 494 patients treated within the randomized phase 3 United Kingdom Leukaemia Research Fund Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 4 (UK LRF CCL4) trial that compared chlorambucil and fludarabine with and without cyclophosphamide in previously untreated patients. We investigated the relationship of mutations in NOTCH1 (exon 34) and SF3B1 (exon 14-16) to treatment response, survival and a panel of established biologic variables. NOTCH1 and SF3B1 mutations were found in 10% and17% of patients, respectively. NOTCH1 mutations correlated with unmutated IGHV genes, trisomy 12, high CD38/ ZAP-70 expression and were associated with reduced overall (median 54.8 vs 74.6 months, P = .02) and progression-free (median 22.0 vs 26.4 months, P = .02) survival. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with high CD38 expression and with shorter overall survival (median 54.3 vs 79.0 months, P < .001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis, including baseline clinical variables, treatment, and adverse prognostic factors demonstrated that although TP53 alterations remained the most informative marker of dismal survival in this cohort, NOTCH1 (HR 1.58, P = .03) and SF3B1 (HR 1.52, P = .01) mutations have added independent prognostic value.",cancer

We have performed a careful selection of descriptors and kept a homogeneous Molecular Interaction Field-based descriptor set and linear (Partial Least Squares, PLS) and non-linear (Random Forest, RF) models. We have tested the models, which we deem orthogonal in nature due to different descriptors and statistical approaches, with good results. In particular we tested the RF model, via a leave-class-out approach and by using a set of 34 additional compounds not used for training. We report comparable results against in vivo scaling approaches with geometric mean-fold error at or below 2 (for a set of 60 compounds with animal data available) and discuss the predictive performance based on the ionization states of the compounds. Lastly, we report the finding using a two-tier approach (classification and regression) based on VDss ranges, in an attempt to improve the prediction of compounds with very high VDss. We would recommend, overall, the RF model, with 33 descriptors, as the primary choice for VDss prediction in human.  .",nonCancer
605,MET Exon 14 Mutations in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer Are Associated With Advanced Age and Stage-Dependent MET Genomic Amplification and c-Met Overexpression.,"Non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) harboring mutations in MET exon 14 and its flanking introns may respond to c-Met inhibitors. We sought to describe the clinical, pathologic, and genomic characteristics of patients with cancer with MET exon 14 mutations. We interrogated next-generation sequencing results from 6,376 cancers to identify those harboring MET exon 14 mutations. Clinical characteristics of MET exon 14 mutated NSCLCs were compared with those of NSCLCs with activating mutations in KRAS and EGFR. Co-occurring genomic mutations and copy number alterations were identified. c-Met immunohistochemistry and real-time polymerase chain reaction to detect exon 14 skipping were performed where sufficient tissue was available. MET exon 14 mutations were identified in 28 of 933 nonsquamous NSCLCs (3.0%) and were not seen in other cancer types in this study. Patients with MET exon 14-mutated NSCLC were significantly older (median age, 72.5 years) than patients with EGFR-mutant (median age, 61 years; P < .001) or KRAS-mutant NSCLC (median age, 65 years; P < .001). Among patients with MET exon 14 mutations, 68% were women, and 36% were never-smokers. Stage IV MET exon 14-mutated NSCLCs were significantly more likely to have concurrent MET genomic amplification (mean ratio of MET to chromosome 7, 4.3) and strong c-Met immunohistochemical expression (mean H score, 253) than stage IA to IIIB MET exon 14-mutated NSCLCs (mean ratio of MET to chromosome 7, 1.4; P = .007; mean H score, 155; P = .002) and stage IV MET exon 14-wild-type NSCLCs (mean ratio of MET to chromosome 7, 1.2; P < .001; mean H score, 142; P < .001). A patient whose lung cancer harbored a MET exon 14 mutation with concurrent genomic amplification of the mutated MET allele experienced a major partial response to the c-Met inhibitor crizotinib. MET exon 14 mutations represent a clinically unique molecular subtype of NSCLC. Prospective clinical trials with c-Met inhibitors will be necessary to validate MET exon 14 mutations as an important therapeutic target in NSCLC.",cancer

Although cyclin D functions appear largely tissue specific, we demonstrate that cyclin D3 has unique functions in lymphocyte development and cannot be replaced by cyclin D2, which is also expressed during blood differentiation. We show that only combined deletion of p27(Kip1) and retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (Rb) is sufficient to rescue the development of Ccnd3(-/-) thymocytes. Furthermore, we show that a small molecule targeting the kinase function of cyclin D3:CDK4/6 inhibits both cell cycle entry in human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and disease progression in animal models of T-ALL. These studies identify unique functions for cyclin D3:CDK4/6 complexes and suggest potential therapeutic protocols for this devastating blood tumor.",cancer
2099,Computational identification of microRNAs associated to both epithelial to mesenchymal transition and NGAL/MMP-9 pathways in bladder cancer.,"Bladder cancer is one of the leading cancer of the urinary tract. It is often diagnosed at advanced stage of the disease. To date, no specific and effective early detection biomarkers are available. Cancer development and progression are associated with the involvement of both epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and tumor microenvironment of which NGAL/MMP-9 complex represents the main player in bladder cancer. It is known that change in microRNAs (miRNAs) expression may result in gene modulation. Therefore, the identification of specific miRNAs associated with EMT pathway and NGAL/MMP-9 complex may be useful to detect the development of bladder cancer at early stages.On this ground, the expression levels of miRNAs in public available datasets of bladder cancer containing data of non-coding RNA profiling was evaluated. This analysis revealed a group of 16 miRNAs differentially expressed between bladder cancer patients and related healthy controls. By miRNA prediction tool (mirDIP), the relationship between the identified miRNAs and the EMT genes was established. Using the DIANA-mirPath (v.2) software, miRNAs, able to modulate the expression of NGAL and MMP-9 genes, were recognized.The results of this study provide evidence that the downregulated hsa-miR-145-5p and hsa-miR-214-3p may modulate the expression of both EMT and NGAL/MMP-9 pathways. Therefore, further validation analyses may confirm the usefulness of these selected miRNAs for predicting the development of bladder cancer at the early stage of the disease.",nonCancer

This is the first study assessing the clinical impact of CEBPA gene status and expression on the ovarian cancer outcome. The CEBPA gene sequence was analyzed in 118 ovarian cancer patients (44 platinum/cyclophosphamide (PC)-treated and 74 taxane/platinum (TP)-treated), both in tumors and blood samples, and in blood from 236 healthy women, using PCR-Sanger sequencing and Real-Time quantitative PCR (qPCR)-based genotyping methods, respectively. The CEBPA mRNA level was examined with Reverse Transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The results were correlated to different clinicopathological parameters. Thirty of 118 (25.4%) tumors harbored the CEBPA synonymous c.690G>T polymorphism (rs34529039), that we showed to be related to up-regulation of CEBPA mRNA levels (p=0.0059). The presence of the polymorphism was significantly associated with poor prognosis (p=0.005) and poor response to the PC chemotherapy regimen (p=0.024). In accordance, elevated CEBPA mRNA levels negatively affected patient survival (p<0.001) and tumor response to the PC therapy (p=0.014). The rs34529039 SNP did not affect the risk of developing ovarian cancer. This is the first study providing evidence that the c.690G>T, p.(Thr230Thr) (rs34529039) polymorphism of the CEBPA gene, together with up-regulation of its mRNA expression, are negative factors worsening ovarian cancer outcome. Their adverse clinical effect depends on a therapeutic regimen used, which might make them potential prognostic and predictive biomarkers for response to DNA-damaging chemotherapy.",nonCancer

Pooled complete clinical response was 45.8% (95% CI, 31.4%-60.5%), and pooled complete pathological response was 44.2% (95% CI, 36.4%-52.0%). Median follow-up was 54 months (range, 12-81 months). ypT0 tumors had a pooled local recurrence rate of 4.0% (95% CI, 1.9%-6.9%) and a median disease-free survival rate of 95.0% (95% CI, 87.4%-100%). Pooled local recurrence and median disease-free survival rates for ypT1 tumors or higher were 21.9% (95% CI, 15.9%-28.5%) and 68.0% (58.3%-69.0%). Pooled incidence of complications was 23.2% (95% CI, 15.7%-31.7%), with suture-line dehiscence reported in 9.9% (95% CI, 4.8%-16.7%).|Limitations included study quality, high risk of selection bias and detection bias in study designs, and limited sample sizes.|Local excision after neoadjuvant therapy should only be considered a curative treatment if complete pathological response is obtained. Given the high rate of local recurrence among incomplete responders, future studies should focus on predicting patients who will achieve complete pathological response.",nonCancer
881,Non-genomic and Immune Evolution of Melanoma Acquiring MAPKi Resistance.,"Clinically acquired resistance to MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapies for melanoma cannot be fully explained by genomic mechanisms and may be accompanied by co-evolution of intra-tumoral immunity. We sought to discover non-genomic mechanisms of acquired resistance and dynamic immune compositions by a comparative, transcriptomic-methylomic analysis of patient-matched melanoma tumors biopsied before therapy and during disease progression. Transcriptomic alterations across resistant tumors were highly recurrent, in contrast to mutations, and were frequently correlated with differential methylation of tumor cell-intrinsic CpG sites. We identified in the tumor cell compartment supra-physiologic c-MET up-expression, infra-physiologic LEF1 down-expression and YAP1 signature enrichment as drivers of acquired resistance. Importantly, high intra-tumoral cytolytic T cell inflammation prior to MAPKi therapy preceded CD8 T cell deficiency/exhaustion and loss of antigen presentation in half of disease-progressive melanomas, suggesting cross-resistance to salvage anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy. Thus, melanoma acquires MAPKi resistance with highly dynamic and recurrent non-genomic alterations and co-evolving intra-tumoral immunity.",cancer
722,PD-L1 is an independent prognostic predictor in gastric cancer of Western patients.,"Targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoint signaling is a novel promising treatment strategy in several tumor entities, and it is suggested that PD-L1/PD-1 expression is predictive for a PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor treatment response. We investigated the expression of PD-L1 and PD-1 by immunohistochemistry in a large and well characterized gastric cancer (GC) cohort of Caucasian patients, consisting of 465 GC samples and 15 corresponding liver metastases. Staining results were correlated with clinico-pathological characteristics and survival. PD-L1 expression was found in tumor cells of 140 GCs (30.1%) and 9 liver metastases (60%) respectively in immune cells of 411 GCs (88.4%) and 11 liver metastases (73.3%). PD-1 was expressed in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in 250 GCs (53.8%) and in 11 liver metastases (73.3%). PD-L1 expression was significantly more prevalent in men, GCs of the proximal stomach, unclassified, papillary, Her2/neu-positive, Epstein-Barr-virus-positive, microsatellite instable, and PIK3CA-mutated GCs. A high PD-L1/PD-1 expression was associated with a significantly better patient outcome, and PD-L1 turned out to be an independent survival prognosticator. The correlation of PD-L1/PD-1 expression with distinct clinico-pathological patient characteristics may serve as a surrogate marker of PD-L1-positive GCs and may direct the use of immune checkpoint treatment strategies.",cancer
1837,Magnon edge states in the hardcore- Bose-Hubbard model.,"Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation has uncovered nonzero Berry curvature and bosonic edge states in the hardcore-Bose-Hubbard model on the gapped honeycomb lattice. The competition between the chemical potential and staggered onsite potential leads to an interesting quantum phase diagram comprising the superfluid phase, Mott insulator, and charge density wave insulator. In this paper, we present a semiclassical perspective of this system by mapping to a spin-1/2 quantum XY model. We give an explicit analytical origin of the quantum phase diagram, the Berry curvatures, and the edge states using semiclassical approximations. We find very good agreement between the semiclassical analyses and the QMC results. Our results show that the topological properties of the hardcore-Bose-Hubbard model are the same as those of magnon in the corresponding quantum spin system. Our results are applicable to systems of ultracold bosonic atoms trapped in honeycomb optical lattices.",nonCancer
667,Identification of the transforming EML4-ALK fusion gene in non-small-cell lung cancer.,Improvement in the clinical outcome of lung cancer is likely to be achieved by identification of the molecular events that underlie its pathogenesis. Here we show that a small inversion within chromosome 2p results in the formation of a fusion gene comprising portions of the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Mouse 3T3 fibroblasts forced to express this human fusion tyrosine kinase generated transformed foci in culture and subcutaneous tumours in nude mice. The EML4-ALK fusion transcript was detected in 6.7% (5 out of 75) of NSCLC patients examined; these individuals were distinct from those harbouring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor gene. Our data demonstrate that a subset of NSCLC patients may express a transforming fusion kinase that is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target as well as for a diagnostic molecular marker in NSCLC.,cancer
1481,Quantum correlations in chiral graphene nanoribbons.,"We compute the entanglement and the quantum discord (QD) between two edge spins in chiral graphene nanoribbons (CGNRs) thermalized with a reservoir at temperature T (canonical ensemble). We show that the entanglement only exists in inter-edge coupled spin pairs, and there is no entanglement between any two spins at the same ribbon edge. By contrast, almost all edge spin pairs can hold non-zero QD, which strongly depends on the ribbon width and the Coulomb repulsion among electrons. More intriguingly, the dominant entanglement always occurs in the pair of nearest abreast spins across the ribbon, and even at room temperature this type of entanglement is still very robust, especially for narrow CGNRs with the weak Coulomb repulsion. These remarkable properties make CGNRs very promising for possible applications in spin-quantum devices.",nonCancer
2150,Life history of the stem tetrapod Acanthostega revealed by synchrotron microtomography.,"The transition from fish to tetrapod was arguably the most radical series of adaptive shifts in vertebrate evolutionary history. Data are accumulating rapidly for most aspects of these events, but the life histories of the earliest tetrapods remain completely unknown, leaving a major gap in our understanding of these organisms as living animals. Symptomatic of this problem is the unspoken assumption that the largest known Devonian tetrapod fossils represent adult individuals. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, life history data for a Devonian tetrapod, from the Acanthostega mass-death deposit of Stensiö Bjerg, East Greenland. Using propagation phase-contrast synchrotron microtomography (PPC-SRμCT) to visualize the histology of humeri (upper arm bones) and infer their growth histories, we show that even the largest individuals from this deposit are juveniles. A long early juvenile stage with unossified limb bones, during which individuals grew to almost final size, was followed by a slow-growing late juvenile stage with ossified limbs that lasted for at least six years in some individuals. The late onset of limb ossification suggests that the juveniles were exclusively aquatic, and the predominance of juveniles in the sample suggests segregated distributions of juveniles and adults at least at certain times. The absolute size at which limb ossification began differs greatly between individuals, suggesting the possibility of sexual dimorphism, adaptive strategies or competition-related size variation.",nonCancer
1076,Alternative transcription initiation leads to expression of a novel ALK isoform in cancer.,"Activation of oncogenes by mechanisms other than genetic aberrations such as mutations, translocations, or amplifications is largely undefined. Here we report a novel isoform of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) that is expressed in ∼11% of melanomas and sporadically in other human cancer types, but not in normal tissues. The novel ALK transcript initiates from a de novo alternative transcription initiation (ATI) site in ALK intron 19, and was termed ALK(ATI). In ALK(ATI)-expressing tumours, the ATI site is enriched for H3K4me3 and RNA polymerase II, chromatin marks characteristic of active transcription initiation sites. ALK(ATI) is expressed from both ALK alleles, and no recurrent genetic aberrations are found at the ALK locus, indicating that the transcriptional activation is independent of genetic aberrations at the ALK locus. The ALK(ATI) transcript encodes three proteins with molecular weights of 61.1, 60.8 and 58.7 kilodaltons, consisting primarily of the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain. ALK(ATI) stimulates multiple oncogenic signalling pathways, drives growth-factor-independent cell proliferation in vitro, and promotes tumorigenesis in vivo in mouse models. ALK inhibitors can suppress the kinase activity of ALK(ATI), suggesting that patients with ALK(ATI)-expressing tumours may benefit from ALK inhibitors. Our findings suggest a novel mechanism of oncogene activation in cancer through de novo alternative transcription initiation.",cancer
1652,An approach toward public hospital performance assessment.,"Public hospitals have come under heavy scrutiny across the world owing to rising expenditures. However, much of the focus has been on cutting down costs to raise efficiency levels. Although not denying the importance of efficiency measures, this article targets a performance issue that is relevant to address the quality of services rendered in public hospitals. Thus, it is important to focus on the effectiveness of resource utilization in these hospitals. Consequently, this article seeks to examine the impact of average length of stay (ALOS) and bed turnover rates (BTR) on bed occupancy rates (BOR).|Public hospital inpatient utilization records during the period 2006 to 2013 were gathered from the Ministry of Health, Malaysia. A 2-step generalized method of moments (GMM) statistical method was used to analyze the data. BOR was adopted as the dependent variable, whereas BTR and ALOS were used as the explanatory variables. The logarithm of total bed count (BED), admission (ADM), and patient days (PD) was deployed as control variables. Three regression models were developed to explore the correlates of BOR as a hospital performance measure. Ethics committee approval was waived because no patients were identified in the study.|The statistical analyses show that ALOS and BTR are inversely correlated with BOR, with both coefficients significant at 1%. The control variables of BED, ADM, and PD had the right positive signs and they were significant in both sets of equations. Hence, reducing ALOS and BTR can help raise performance of public hospitals in Malaysia.|In light of the robust results obtained, this study offers implications for improving public hospital performance. It shows a need to reduce ALOS and BTR in public hospitals to improve BOR.",nonCancer
2133,Efficacy and safety of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy for chronic hepatitis C patients with renal dysfunction.,"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with renal dysfunction. Daclatasvir and asunaprevir combination therapy showed a high virological response for genotype 1 chronic HCV-infected patients with renal dysfunction on hemodialysis. However, the safety and efficacy of the therapy for patients with renal dysfunction who are not on hemodialysis are not well known. In total 147 patients with chronic HCV genotype 1 infection were treated with 24 weeks of daclatasvir plus asunaprevir therapy. Among these patients, 126 had normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥50 mL/min/1.73m(2) ) and 21 had renal dysfunction (eGFR <50 mL/min/1.73m(2) ). Plasma concentrations of daclatasvir and asunaprevir after 5 days of treatment were the same in the normal renal function and renal dysfunction groups. Early virological response (4, 8, 48, 96 and 168 hrs after the start of the therapy) was similar between the two groups. End-of-treatment response was achieved in 122 (96.8%) and 20 (95.2%) patients with normal renal function and with renal dysfunction, respectively, and sustained virological response was achieved in 119 (94.4%) and 20 (95.2%) patients. The frequency of adverse events was also comparable between the two groups. Treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was required for only one patient in each group. Renal function did not change either during or after treatment in both groups. In conclusion, renal function is unlikely to have a significant impact on blood kinetics of daclatasvir and asunaprevir. This combination therapy was effective and safe for patients without hemodialysis. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer
1510,Palindrome analyser - A new web-based server for predicting and evaluating inverted repeats in nucleotide sequences.,"DNA cruciform structures play an important role in the regulation of natural processes including gene replication and expression, as well as nucleosome structure and recombination. They have also been implicated in the evolution and development of diseases such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. Cruciform structures are formed by inverted repeats, and their stability is enhanced by DNA supercoiling and protein binding. They have received broad attention because of their important roles in biology. Computational approaches to study inverted repeats have allowed detailed analysis of genomes. However, currently there are no easily accessible and user-friendly tools that can analyse inverted repeats, especially among long nucleotide sequences. We have developed a web-based server, Palindrome analyser, which is a user-friendly application for analysing inverted repeats in various DNA (or RNA) sequences including genome sequences and oligonucleotides. It allows users to search and retrieve desired gene/nucleotide sequence entries from the NCBI databases, and provides data on length, sequence, locations and energy required for cruciform formation. Palindrome analyser also features an interactive graphical data representation of the distribution of the inverted repeats, with options for sorting according to the length of inverted repeat, length of loop, and number of mismatches. Palindrome analyser can be accessed at http://bioinformatics.ibp.cz.",nonCancer
2231,Age-related cortical thickness trajectories in first episode psychosis patients presenting with early persistent negative symptoms.,"Recent work has clearly established that early persistent negative symptoms (ePNS) can be observed following a first episode of psychosis (FEP), and can negatively affect functional outcome. There is also evidence for cortical changes associated with ePNS. Given that a FEP often occurs during a period of ongoing complex brain development and maturation, neuroanatomical changes may have a specific age-related component. The current study examines cortical thickness (CT) and trajectories with age using longitudinal structural imaging. Structural T1 volumes were acquired at three time points for ePNS (N=21), PNS due to secondary factors (N=31), non-PNS (N=45) patients, and controls (N=48). Images were processed using the CIVET pipeline. Linear mixed models were applied to test for the main effects of (a) group, (b) time, and interactions between (c) time and group membership, and (d) age and group membership. Compared with the non-PNS and secondary PNS patient groups, the ePNS group showed cortical thinning over time in temporal regions and a thickening with age primarily in prefrontal areas. Early PNS patients also had significantly different linear and quadratic age relationships with CT compared with other groups within cingulate, prefrontal, and temporal cortices. The current study demonstrates that FEP patients with ePNS show significantly different CT trajectories with age. Increased CT may be indicative of disruptions in cortical maturation processes within higher-order brain regions. Individuals with ePNS underline a unique subgroup of FEP patients that are differentiated at the clinical level and who exhibit distinct neurobiological patterns compared with their non-PNS peers.",nonCancer
2171,Extracellular domain shedding influences specific tumor uptake and organ distribution of the EGFR PET tracer 89Zr-imgatuzumab.,"Preclinical positron emission tomography (PET) imaging revealed a mismatch between in vivo epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and EGFR antibody tracer tumor uptake. Shed EGFR ectodomain (sEGFR), which is present in cancer patient sera, can potentially bind tracer and therefore influence tracer kinetics. To optimize EGFR-PET, we examined the influence of sEGFR levels on tracer kinetics and tumor uptake of EGFR monoclonal antibody 89Zr-imgatuzumab in varying xenograft models. Human cancer cell lines A431 (EGFR overexpressing, epidermoid), A549 and H441 (both EGFR medium expressing, non-small cell lung cancer) were xenografted in mice. Xenografted mice received 10, 25 or 160 μg 89Zr-imgatuzumab, co-injected with equal doses 111In-IgG control. MicroPET scans were made 24, 72 and 144 h post injection, followed by biodistribution analysis. sEGFR levels in liver and plasma samples were determined by ELISA. 89Zr-imgatuzumab uptake in A431 tumors was highest (29.8 ± 5.4 %ID/g) in the 160 μg dose group. Contrary, highest uptake in A549 and H441 tumors was found at the lowest (10 μg) 89Zr-imgatuzumab dose. High 89Zr-imgatuzumab liver accumulation was found in A431 xenografted mice, which decreased with antibody dose increments. 89Zr-imgatuzumab liver uptake in A549 and H441 xenografted mice was low at all doses. sEGFR levels in liver and plasma of A431 bearing mice were up to 1000-fold higher than levels found in A549, H441 and non-tumor xenografted mice. 89Zr-imgatuzumab effectively visualizes EGFR-expressing tumors. High sEGFR levels can redirect 89Zr-imgatuzumab to the liver, in which case tumor visualization can be improved by increasing tracer antibody dose.",nonCancer
745,Predictive value of CHFR and MLH1 methylation in human gastric cancer.,"Gastric carcinoma (GC) has one of the highest mortality rates of cancer diseases and has a high incidence rate in China. Palliative chemotherapy is the main treatment for advanced gastric cancer. It is necessary to compare the effectiveness and toxicities of different regimens. This study explores the possibility of methylation of DNA damage repair genes serving as a prognostic and chemo-sensitive marker in human gastric cancer. The methylation status of five DNA damage repair genes (CHFR, FANCF, MGMT, MLH1, and RASSF1A) was detected by nested methylation-specific PCR in 102 paraffin-embedded gastric cancer samples. Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the association of methylation status and clinic-pathological factors. The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to analyze the association of methylation status and chemo-sensitivity. The results indicate that CHFR, MLH1, RASSF1A, MGMT, and FANCF were methylated in 34.3% (35/102), 21.6% (22/102), 12.7% (13/102), 9.8% (10/102), and 0% (0/102) of samples, respectively. No association was found between methylation of CHFR, MLH1, RASSF1A, MGMT, or FANCF with gender, age, tumor size, tumor differentiation, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. In docetaxel-treated gastric cancer patients, resistance to docetaxel was found in CHFR unmethylated patients by Cox proportional hazards model (HR 0.243, 95% CI, 0.069-0.859, p = 0.028), and overall survival is longer in the CHFR methylated group compared with the CHFR unmethylated group (log-rank, p = 0.036). In oxaliplatin-treated gastric cancer patients, resistance to oxaliplatin was found in MLH1 methylated patients (HR 2.988, 95% CI, 1.064-8.394, p = 0.038), and overall survival was longer in the MLH1 unmethylated group compared with the MLH1 methylated group (log-rank, p = 0.046). CHFR is frequently methylated in human gastric cancer, and CHFR methylation may serve as a docetaxel-sensitive marker. MLH1 methylation was related to oxaliplatin resistance in gastric cancer patients.",cancer
1343,Dysregulated Expression of Long Noncoding RNAs in Ovarian Cancer.,"Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death among women with gynecologic malignancies. The development and progression of ovarian cancer are complex and a multiple-step process. New biomarker molecules for diagnostic and prognostic are essential for novel therapeutic targets and to extend the survival time of patients with ovarian cancer. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are non-protein-coding transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides that have recently been found as key regulators of various biological processes and to be involved in the development and progression of many diseases including cancers. In this review, we summarized the expression pattern of several dysregulated lncRNAs (HOTAIR, H19, XIST, and HOST2) and the functional molecular mechanism of these lncRNAs on the initiation and progression of ovarian cancer. The lncRNAs as biomarkers may be used for current and future clinical diagnosis, therapeutics, and prognosis.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard therapy for non-oncodrivers population. Sorafenib is a small molecule that blocks the activation of C-RAF, B-RAF, c-KIT, FLT-3, RET, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3 and PDGFR approved for advanced renal cell and hepatocellular carcinoma (b, c).

120,PIK3CA mutations in colorectal cancer are associated with clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted monoclonal antibodies.,"The monoclonal antibodies (moAb) panitumumab and cetuximab target the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and have proven valuable for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). EGFR-mediated signaling involves two main intracellular cascades: on one side KRAS activates BRAF, which in turn triggers the mitogen-activated protein kinases. On the other, membrane localization of the lipid kinase PIK3CA counteracts PTEN and promotes AKT1 phosphorylation, thereby activating a parallel intracellular axis. Constitutive activation of KRAS bypasses the corresponding signaling cascade and, accordingly, patients with mCRC bearing KRAS mutations are clinically resistant to therapy with panitumumab or cetuximab. We hypothesized that mutations activating PIK3CA could also preclude responsiveness to EGFR-targeted moAbs through a similar mechanism. Here, we present the mutational analysis of PIK3CA and KRAS and evaluation of the PTEN protein status in a cohort of 110 patients with mCRC treated with anti-EGFR moAbs. We observed 15 (13.6%) PIK3CA and 32 (29.0%) KRAS mutations. PIK3CA mutations were significantly associated with clinical resistance to panitumumab or cetuximab; none of the mutated patients achieved objective response (P = 0.038). When only KRAS wild-type tumors were analyzed, the statistical correlation was stronger (P = 0.016). Patients with PIK3CA mutations displayed a worse clinical outcome also in terms of progression-free survival (P = 0.035). Our data indicate that PIK3CA mutations can independently hamper the therapeutic response to panitumumab or cetuximab in mCRC. When the molecular status of the PIK3CA/PTEN and KRAS pathways are concomitantly ascertained, up to 70% of mCRC patients unlikely to respond to EGFR moAbs can be identified.",cancer
2031,Pancreatic stellate cell secreted IL-6 stimulates STAT3 dependent invasiveness of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer cells.,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a dynamic tumor supported by several stromal elements such as pancreatic stellate cells (PSC). Significant crosstalk exists between PSCs and tumor cells to stimulate oncogenic signaling and malignant progression of PDAC. However, how PSCs activate intercellular signaling in PDAC cells remains to be elucidated. We have previously shown that activated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling is a key component in the progression of pancreatic neoplasia. We hypothesize that PSC secreted IL-6 activates STAT3 signaling to promote PanIN progression to PDAC. Human PDAC and mouse PanIN cells were treated with PSC-conditioned media (PSC-CM), and phospho- and total-STAT3 levels by immunoblot analysis were determined. IL-6 was quantified in PSC-CM and cell invasion and colony formation assays were performed in the presence or absence of a neutralizing IL-6 antibody and the JAK/STAT3 inhibitor AZD1480. Serum from Ptf1aCre/+;LSL-KrasG12D/+;Tgfbr2flox/flox (PKT) and LSL-KrasG12D/+; Trp53R172H/+; Pdx1Cre/+ (KPC) mice demonstrated increased levels of IL-6 compared to serum from non-PDAC bearing KC and PK mice. PSC secreted IL-6 activated STAT3 signaling in noninvasive, precursor PanIN cells as well as PDAC cells, resulting in enhanced cell invasion and colony formation in both cell types. There was a significant positive linear correlation between IL-6 concentration and the ratio of phosphorylated STAT3/total STAT3. IL-6 neutralization or STAT3 inhibition attenuated PSC-CM induced activation of STAT3 signaling and tumorigenicity. These data provide evidence that PSCs are directly involved in promoting the progression of PanINs towards invasive carcinoma. This study demonstrates a novel role of PSC secreted IL-6 in transitioning noninvasive pancreatic precursor cells into invasive PDAC through the activation of STAT3 signaling.",nonCancer

907,Early Adaptation and Acquired Resistance to CDK4/6 Inhibition in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer.,"Small-molecule inhibitors of the CDK4/6 cell-cycle kinases have shown clinical efficacy in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive metastatic breast cancer, although their cytostatic effects are limited by primary and acquired resistance. Here we report that ER-positive breast cancer cells can adapt quickly to CDK4/6 inhibition and evade cytostasis, in part, via noncanonical cyclin D1-CDK2-mediated S-phase entry. This adaptation was prevented by cotreatment with hormone therapies or PI3K inhibitors, which reduced the levels of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and other G1-S cyclins, abolished pRb phosphorylation, and inhibited activation of S-phase transcriptional programs. Combined targeting of both CDK4/6 and PI3K triggered cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and in patient-derived tumor xenograft (PDX) models, resulting in tumor regression and improved disease control. Furthermore, a triple combination of endocrine therapy, CDK4/6, and PI3K inhibition was more effective than paired combinations, provoking rapid tumor regressions in a PDX model. Mechanistic investigations showed that acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition resulted from bypass of cyclin D1-CDK4/6 dependency through selection of CCNE1 amplification or RB1 loss. Notably, although PI3K inhibitors could prevent resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors, they failed to resensitize cells once resistance had been acquired. However, we found that cells acquiring resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors due to CCNE1 amplification could be resensitized by targeting CDK2. Overall, our results illustrate convergent mechanisms of early adaptation and acquired resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors that enable alternate means of S-phase entry, highlighting strategies to prevent the acquisition of therapeutic resistance to these agents.

397,Cetuximab treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer with KRAS p.G13D mutations improves progression-free survival.,"A number of previous studies have reported that 30-50% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) harbor Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations, which is a major predictive biomarker of resistance to epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-targeted therapy. Treatment with an anti-EGFR inhibitor is recommended for patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). A recent retrospective study of cetuximab reported that patients with KRAS p.G13D mutations had better outcomes compared with those with other mutations. The aim of this retrospective study was to assess the prevalence of KRAS p.G13D mutations and evaluate the effectiveness of cetuximab in mCRC patients with KRAS p.G13D or other KRAS mutations. We reviewed the clinical records of 98 mCRC patients with KRAS mutations who were treated between August, 2004 and January, 2011 in four hospitals located in Tokyo and Kyushu Island. We also investigated KRAS mutation subtypes and patient characteristics. In the patients who received cetuximab, univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to assess the effect of KRAS p.G13D mutations on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Of the 98 patients, 23 (23.5%) had KRAS p.G13D-mutated tumors, whereas 75 (76.5%) had tumors harboring other mutations. Of the 31 patients who received cetuximab, 9 (29.0%) had KRAS p.G13D mutations and 22 (71.0%) had other mutations. There were no significant differences in age, gender, primary site, pathological type, history of chemotherapy, or the combined use of irinotecan between either of the patient subgroups. The univariate analysis revealed no significant difference in PFS or OS between the patients with KRAS p.G13D mutations and those with other mutations (median PFS, 4.5 vs. 2.8 months, respectively; P=0.65; and median OS, 15.3 vs. 8.9 months, respectively; P=0.51). However, the multivariate analysis revealed a trend toward better PFS among patients harboring p.G13D mutations (PFS: HR=0.29; 95% CI: 0.08-1.10; P=0.07; OS: HR=0.23; 95% CI: 0.04-1.54; P=0.13). In conclusion, treatment with cetuximab may be more clinically beneficial in mCRC patients with a KRAS p.G13D mutation, compared with those harboring other mutations. However, further investigation is required to clearly determine the benefits of cetuximab treatment in patients with KRAS p.G13D mutation-positive mCRC.",cancer

In this study, we explored the association between genetic variants in the p14ARF/MDM2/TP53 pathway and prognosis in ESCC patients with radical resection. 124 ESCC patients with radical resection were included in this retrospective study and genotyped using the MassArray method. According to multivariate Cox hazard analysis and multiple testing, the TC/CC genotype of p14ARF rs3814960 was shown to be strongly related to a decreased overall survival (OS) (HR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.33-5.75, P = 0.006, Pc = 0.030) and disease-free survival (DFS) (HR = 2.45, 95% CI: 1.30-4.61, P = 0.005, Pc = 0.025). Moreover, patients with the DEL/A +AA genotype of MDM2 rs34886328 had a notably increased OS (HR = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.56, P = 4.7×10-4, Pc = 0.003) and DFS (HR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.11-0.43, P = 1.1×10-5, Pc = 6.6×10-5). We also found that these two SNPs had a cumulative effect on the prognosis of ESCC, with the OS (P < 0.001) and DFS (P < 0.001) being shortest for patients carrying both of these unfavorable genotypes. In conclusion, genetic variants of the p14ARF/MDM2/TP53 pathway are significantly related to OS and DFS, and may be predictors of the prognosis of ESCC after surgery. We speculate the individuals with the TC/CC genotype of p14ARF rs3814960 and/or the DEL/DEL genotype of MDMD2 rs34886328 should have more aggressive treatment and may greatly benefit from early prediction and prevention of an unfavorable prognosis by genotyping before the initiation of therapy. These findings should be further validated in a larger population.",cancer
1793,Epidemiology of Fracture Nonunion in 18 Human Bones.,"Failure of bone fracture healing occurs in 5% to 10% of all patients. Nonunion risk is associated with the severity of injury and with the surgical treatment technique, yet progression to nonunion is not fully explained by these risk factors.|To test a hypothesis that fracture characteristics and patient-related risk factors assessable by the clinician at patient presentation can indicate the probability of fracture nonunion.|An inception cohort study in a large payer database of patients with fracture in the United States was conducted using patient-level health claims for medical and drug expenses compiled for approximately 90.1 million patients in calendar year 2011. The final database collated demographic descriptors, treatment procedures as per Current Procedural Terminology codes; comorbidities as per International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes; and drug prescriptions as per National Drug Code Directory codes. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) for variables associated with nonunion. Data analysis was performed from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2012.|Continuous enrollment in the database was required for 12 months after fracture to allow sufficient time to capture a nonunion diagnosis.|The final analysis of 309 330 fractures in 18 bones included 178 952 women (57.9%); mean (SD) age was 44.48 (13.68) years. The nonunion rate was 4.9%. Elevated nonunion risk was associated with severe fracture (eg, open fracture, multiple fractures), high body mass index, smoking, and alcoholism. Women experienced more fractures, but men were more prone to nonunion. The nonunion rate also varied with fracture location: scaphoid, tibia plus fibula, and femur were most likely to be nonunion. The ORs for nonunion fractures were significantly increased for risk factors, including number of fractures (OR, 2.65; 95% CI, 2.34-2.99), use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs plus opioids (OR, 1.84; 95% CI, 1.73-1.95), operative treatment (OR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.69-1.86), open fracture (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.55-1.77), anticoagulant use (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.51-1.66), osteoarthritis with rheumatoid arthritis (OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.38-1.82), anticonvulsant use with benzodiazepines (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.36-1.62), opioid use (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.34-1.52), diabetes (OR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.21-1.61), high-energy injury (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.27-1.49), anticonvulsant use (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.31-1.43), osteoporosis (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.14-1.34), male gender (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.16-1.25), insulin use (OR, 1.21; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31), smoking (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.14-1.26), benzodiazepine use (OR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.10-1.31), obesity (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12-1.25), antibiotic use (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.13-1.21), osteoporosis medication use (OR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.08-1.26), vitamin D deficiency (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.05-1.22), diuretic use (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.18), and renal insufficiency (OR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.04-1.17) (multivariate P < .001 for all).|The probability of fracture nonunion can be based on patient-specific risk factors at presentation. Risk of nonunion is a function of fracture severity, fracture location, disease comorbidity, and medication use.",nonCancer
501,BRCA1 is both a prognostic and predictive biomarker of response to chemotherapy in sporadic epithelial ovarian cancer.,"We investigated the relationship between BRCA1 protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and clinical outcome following platinum and platinum/taxane chemotherapy in sporadic epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). BRCA1 IHC was performed on a cohort of 292 ovarian tumours from two UK oncology centres. BRCA1 protein expression levels were correlated with overall survival (OS), progression free survival (PFS) and clinical response to chemotherapy by multivariate analysis. EOC patients with absent/low BRCA1 protein expression (41%) had a better chance of clinical response following chemotherapy as compared to patients with high BRCA1 expression (odds ratio 2.47: 95%CI 1.10-5.55, p=0.029). Patients with absent/low BRCA1 had a higher probability of clinical response following single agent platinum compared to high BRCA1 expressing patients (68.5% vs. 46.8%), while addition of a taxane increased response rates independent of BRCA1. Overall, patients with absent/low BRCA1 had a better clinical outcome compared to patients with high BRCA1 protein expression in terms of both OS (HR=0.65: 95%CI 0.48-0.88, p=0.006) and PFS (HR=0.74, 95%CI 0.55-0.98, p=0.040). We confirm that absent/low BRCA1 protein expression is a favourable prognostic marker. However, we also provide the first evidence that absent/low BRCA1 protein expression in sporadic EOC patients predicts for an improved clinical response to chemotherapy.",cancer
882,MiR-144 Inhibits Uveal Melanoma Cell Proliferation and Invasion by Regulating c-Met Expression.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a group endogenous small non-coding RNAs that inhibit protein translation through binding to specific target mRNAs. Recent studies have demonstrated that miRNAs are implicated in the development of cancer. However, the role of miR-144 in uveal melanoma metastasis remains largely unknown. MiR-144 was downregulated in both uveal melanoma cells and tissues. Transfection of miR-144 mimic into uveal melanoma cells led to a decrease in cell growth and invasion. After identification of two putative miR-144 binding sites within the 3' UTR of the human c-Met mRNA, miR-144 was proved to inhibit the luciferase activity inMUM-2B cells with a luciferase reporter construct containing the binding sites. In addition, the expression of c-Met protein was inhibited by miR-144. Furthermore, c-Met-mediated cell proliferation and invasion were inhibited by restoration of miR-144 in uveal melanoma cells. In conclusion, miR-144 acts as a tumor suppressor in uveal melanoma, through inhibiting cell proliferation and migration. miR-144 might serve as a potential therapeutic target in uveal melanoma patients.",cancer
1091,Novel germline mutation of KIT associated with familial gastrointestinal stromal tumors and mastocytosis.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are often associated with activating KIT mutations, affecting regulatory domains of the KIT tyrosine kinase. Sporadic mastocytosis in adults is usually also caused by KIT mutations that, however, activate KIT by affecting the intracellular enzymatic site of the molecule. Most GISTs respond to KIT inhibitors that bind to the enzymatic site; in most cases of mastocytosis, however, the modified enzymatic site is not affected by these drugs. We present a kindred with both familial GISTs and mastocytosis that express a novel germline KIT mutation in exon 8, resulting in deletion of codon 419 and affecting the extracellular domain of KIT. This mutation activates KIT, and the mutant KIT is inhibited by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate. Our studies identify a new regulatory region in the KIT molecule and strongly suggest that patients with extracellular KIT mutations respond to tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",cancer
843,Durable responses to imatinib in patients with PDGFRB fusion gene-positive and BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders.,"Fusion genes derived from the platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) or alpha (PDGFRA) play an important role in the pathogenesis of BCR-ABL-negative chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMPDs). These fusion genes encode constitutively activated receptor tyrosine kinases that can be inhibited by imatinib. Twelve patients with BCR-ABL-negative CMPDs and reciprocal translocations involving PDGFRB received imatinib for a median of 47 months (range, 0.1-60 months). Eleven had prompt responses with normalization of peripheral-blood cell counts and disappearance of eosinophilia; 10 had complete resolution of cytogenetic abnormalities and decrease or disappearance of fusion transcripts as measured by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Updates were sought from 8 further patients previously described in the literature; prompt responses were described in 7 and persist in 6. Our data show that durable hematologic and cytogenetic responses are achieved with imatinib in patients with PDGFRB fusion-positive, BCR-ABL-negative CMPDs.",cancer
757,The ALK/ROS1 Inhibitor PF-06463922 Overcomes Primary Resistance to Crizotinib in ALK-Driven Neuroblastoma.,"Neuroblastomas harboring activating point mutations in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) are differentially sensitive to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib, with certain mutations conferring intrinsic crizotinib resistance. To overcome this clinical obstacle, our goal was to identify inhibitors with improved potency that can target intractable ALK variants such as F1174L. We find that PF-06463922 has high potency across ALK variants and inhibits ALK more effectively than crizotinib in vitro. Most importantly, PF-06463922 induces complete tumor regression in both crizotinib-resistant and crizotinib-sensitive xenograft mouse models of neuroblastoma, as well as in patient-derived xenografts harboring the crizotinib-resistant F1174L or F1245C mutations. These studies demonstrate that PF-06463922 has the potential to overcome crizotinib resistance and exerts unprecedented activity as a single targeted agent against F1174L and F1245C ALK-mutated xenograft tumors, while also inducing responses in an R1275Q xenograft model. Taken together, these results provide the rationale to move PF-06463922 into clinical trials for treatment of patients with ALK-mutated neuroblastoma. The next-generation ALK/ROS1 inhibitor PF-06463922 exerts unparalleled activity in ALK-driven neuroblastoma models with primary crizotinib resistance. Our biochemical and in vivo data provide the preclinical rationale for fast-tracking the development of this agent in children with relapsed/refractory ALK-mutant neuroblastoma.",cancer
767,Phase II trial of the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 in patients with advanced CDK4-amplified well-differentiated or dedifferentiated liposarcoma.,"CDK4 is amplified in > 90% of well-differentiated (WDLS) and dedifferentiated liposarcomas (DDLS). The selective cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4)/CDK6 inhibitor PD0332991 inhibits growth and induces senescence in cell lines and xenografts. In a phase I trial of PD0332991, several patients with WDLS or DDLS experienced prolonged stable disease. We performed an open-label phase II study to determine the safety and efficacy of PD0332991 in patients with advanced WDLS/DDLS. Patients age ≥ 18 years experiencing disease progression while receiving systemic therapy before enrollment received PD0332991 200 mg orally once per day for 14 consecutive days in 21-day cycles. All were required to have CDK4 amplification by fluorescence in situ hybridization and retinoblastoma protein (RB) expression by immunohistochemistry (≥ 1+). The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS) at 12 weeks, with 12-week PFS of ≥ 40% considered promising and ≤ 20% not promising. If ≥ nine of 28 patients were progression free at 12 weeks, PD0332991 would be considered active. We screened 48 patients (44 of 48 had CDK4 amplification; 41 of 44 were RB positive). Of those, 30 were enrolled, and 29 were evaluable for the primary end point. Grade 3 to 4 events included anemia (17%), thrombocytopenia (30%), neutropenia (50%), and febrile neutropenia (3%). At 12 weeks, PFS was 66% (90% CI, 51% to 100%), significantly exceeding the primary end point. The median PFS was 18 weeks. There was one partial response. Treatment with the CDK4 inhibitor PD0332991 was associated with a favorable progression-free rate in patients with CDK4-amplified and RB-expressing WDLS/DDLS who had progressive disease despite systemic therapy.",cancer
282,BRAF V600E and TERT promoter mutations cooperatively identify the most aggressive papillary thyroid cancer with highest recurrence.,"To investigate the prognostic value of the BRAF V600E mutation and the recently identified TERT promoter mutation chr5:1,295,228C>T (C228T), individually and in their coexistence, in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). We performed a retrospective study of the relationship of BRAF and TERT C228T mutations with clinicopathologic outcomes of PTC in 507 patients (365 women and 142 men) age 45.9 ± 14.0 years (mean ± SD) with a median follow-up of 24 months (interquartile range, 8 to 78 months). Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT C228T mutations were more commonly associated with high-risk clinicopathologic characteristics of PTC than they were individually. Tumor recurrence rates were 25.8% (50 of 194;77.60 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 58.81 to 102.38) versus 9.6% (30 of 313; 22.88 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 16.00 to 32.72) in BRAF mutation-positive versus -negative patients (hazard ratio [HR], 3.22; 95% CI, 2.05 to 5.07) and 47.5% (29 of 61; 108.55 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 75.43 to 156.20) versus 11.4% (51 of 446; 30.21 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 22.96 to 39.74) in TERT mutation-positive versus -negative patients (HR, 3.46; 95% CI, 2.19 to 5.45). Recurrence rates were 68.6% (24 of 35; 211.76 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 141.94 to 315.94) versus 8.7% (25 of 287; 21.60 recurrences per 1,000 person-years; 95% CI, 14.59 to 31.97) in patients harboring both mutations versus patients harboring neither mutation (HR, 8.51; 95% CI, 4.84 to 14.97), which remained significant after clinicopathologic cofactor adjustments. Disease-free patient survival curves displayed a moderate decline with BRAF V600E or TERT C228T alone but a sharp decline with two coexisting mutations. Coexisting BRAF V600E and TERT C228T mutations form a novel genetic background that defines PTC with the worst clinicopathologic outcomes, providing unique prognostic and therapeutic implications.",cancer
1229,The T393C polymorphism of the G alpha s gene (GNAS1) is a novel prognostic marker in bladder cancer.,"The G protein G(alpha)s pathway is linked to proapoptotic signaling in cancer cell lines. To assess the role of the GNAS1 locus encoding G(alpha)s as a genetic factor for disease progression of transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the bladder, we genotyped the synonymous T393C polymorphism in 254 patients with TCC (minor allele frequency: 0.43) to examine a potential association between genotypes and disease progression. Using Kaplan-Meier estimates to calculate 5-year probabilities of follow-up, we could show that progression-free survival, metastasis-free survival, and cancer-specific survival was significantly increased in TT genotypes (56%, 84%, 82%) compared with CC genotypes (35%, 53%, 58%). In multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis, the T393C polymorphism was an independent prognostic factor for clinical outcome. Homozygous CC patients were at highest risk for progression [odds ratio (OR), 1.94; P = 0.020], metastasis (OR, 3.49; P = 0.005), and tumor-related death (OR, 2.49; P = 0.031) compared with TT genotypes. Heterozygous patients had an intermediate risk compatible with a gene-dose effect. Real-time PCR analysis of urothelial tumor tissue as well as adipose and heart tissue revealed that G(alpha)s mRNA expression was highest in TT genotypes, indicating a proapoptotic effect in these genotypes. In conclusion, the GNAS1 T393C status associated with differential G(alpha)s mRNA expression is a novel independent prognostic marker for clinical outcome supporting a functional role of G(alpha)s in bladder cancer progression.",cancer
219,"EGFR gene amplification is related to adverse clinical outcomes in cervical squamous cell carcinoma, making the EGFR pathway a novel therapeutic target.","The aim of this study was to investigate the patterns of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) overexpression, EGFR gene amplification, and the presence of activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of this gene in squamous cell carcinomas and adenocarcinomas/adenosquamous carcinomas of the uterine cervix. The EGFR expression, amplification, and mutation in cervical carcinomas were assessed by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ hybridisation, and PCR-SSCP, respectively, and correlated with clinical data collected by a retrospective chart review. A functional assessment was performed by inactivating EGFR in cervical cancer cells with the potent inhibitor AG1478. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 6 out of 59 (10.2%) cervical squamous cell carcinomas showed significant amplification of the EGFR locus, whereas none of the 52 adeno/adenosquamous cell carcinomas had detectable EGFR amplification (P<0.05). The EGFR amplification significantly correlated with shorter overall survival (P=0.001) in cervical squamous cell carcinomas. Multivariate analysis showed that EGFR gene amplification was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P=0.011). None of the squamous cell carcinomas (0%: 0 out of 32) had detectable oncogenic mutations in EGFR exons 18 through 21. The frequencies of KRAS and BRAF mutations were very low in both squamous and adeno/adenosquamous cell carcinomas. Sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to AG1478 depended on the presence of EGFR overexpression. AG1478-induced EGFR inactivation in cell lines with EGFR overexpression significantly suppressed tumour development and progression in a mouse xenograft model. Our data suggest that EGFR signalling is important in a subset of cervical squamous cell carcinomas and that anti-EGFR therapy may benefit patients who carry the 7p11.2 amplicon in their tumours.",cancer

2280,Guiding Empiric Treatment for Serious Bacterial Infections via Point of Care [Formula: see text]-Lactamase Characterization.,"Fever is one of the most common symptoms of illness in infants and represents a clinical challenge due to the potential for serious bacterial infection. As delayed treatment for these infections has been correlated with increased morbidity and mortality, broad-spectrum [Formula: see text]-lactam antibiotics are often prescribed while waiting for microbiological lab results (1-3 days). However, the spread of antibiotic resistance via the [Formula: see text]-lactamase enzyme, which can destroy [Formula: see text]-lactam antibiotics, has confounded this paradigm; empiric antibiotic regimens are increasingly unable to cover all potential bacterial pathogens, leaving some infants effectively untreated until the pathogen is characterized. This can lead to lifelong sequela or death. Here, we introduce a fluorescent, microfluidic assay that can characterize [Formula: see text]-lactamase derived antibiotic susceptibility in 20 min with a sensitivity suitable for direct human specimens. The protocol is extensible, and the antibiotic spectrum investigated can be feasibly adapted for the pathogens of regional relevance. This new assay fills an important need by providing the clinician with hitherto unavailable point of care information for treatment guidance in an inexpensive and simple diagnostic format.",nonCancer

We hypothesized that Csat and Rsat in preterm infants with an hsPDA would be decreased compared to those with no PDA or non-significant PDA.|This non a-priori designed study retrospectively investigated clinical and ECHO characteristics of preterm infants <29 weeks gestation who underwent routine NIRS monitoring. Logistic regression assessed association between NIRS measures and an hsPDA by ECHO.|Of 47 infants, 21 had a confirmed hsPDA by ECHO, 14 had a non-significant PDA, and 12 had no ECHO performed due to low clinical suspicion for PDA. Logistic regression adjusted for gestational age found that lower Rsat was associated with an hsPDA by ECHO (OR 0.9, 95% CI 0.83-0.98, p=0.01). Using ROC curves, Rsat <66% identified an hsPDA with a sensitivity of 81% and specificity of 77%, while Csat was not significant.|Low Rsat <66% was associated with the presence of an hsPDA in the preterm infant. Csat may be preserved if cerebral autoregulation is largely intact. Bedside NIRS monitoring may reasonably increase suspicion for a significant PDA in the preterm infant.Pediatric Research (2016); doi:10.1038/pr.2016.148.",nonCancer
2162,Biomimetic Synthesis of Antireflective Silica/Polymer Composite Coatings Comprising Vesicular Nanostructures.,"Antireflective (AR) silica/polymer composite coatings on glass and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrates were prepared by silica mineralization of layer-by-layer (LbL) assembled films composed of polystyrene-block-poly(L-lysine)/poly(L-glutamic acid) (PS-b-PLL/PGA) complex vesicles without any post-treatments. PS-b-PLL AB and A2B block copolymers with appropriate block ratio can self-assemble to form vesicles, which can be deposited onto substrates without dissociation. Silica deposition specifically onto the complex vesicles in the multilayer films through amine-catalyzed polycondensation results in the continuous, intact composite coatings comprising vesicular nanostructures, which provided an additional parameter for tuning their optical properties. The film thickness and porosity are mainly dictated by the bilayer number and the degree of deformation/fission of vesicles upon complexation and mineralization, depending on polymer composition. The coated PMMA substrate with maximum transmission over 98% can be achieved at the optimized wavelength region. The AR composite films were mechanically stable to withstand both the wipe and adhesion tests due to the preparation of continuous, intact films. This study demonstrated that the concept of preparing composite films comprising vesicular nanostructures through the combination of LbL assembly and biomineralization is feasible.",nonCancer
727,"Alectinib in ALK-positive, crizotinib-resistant, non-small-cell lung cancer: a single-group, multicentre, phase 2 trial.","Alectinib--a highly selective, CNS-active, ALK inhibitor-showed promising clinical activity in crizotinib-naive and crizotinib-resistant patients with ALK-rearranged (ALK-positive) non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of alectinib in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who progressed on previous crizotinib. We did a phase 2 study at 27 centres in the USA and Canada. We enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with stage IIIB-IV, ALK-positive NSCLC who had progressed after crizotinib. Patients were treated with oral alectinib 600 mg twice daily until progression, death, or withdrawal. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by an independent review committee using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1. Response endpoints were assessed in the response-evaluable population (ie, patients with measurable disease at baseline who received at least one dose of study drug), and efficacy and safety analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population (all enrolled patients). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01871805. The study is ongoing and patients are still receiving treatment. Between Sept 4, 2013, and Aug 4, 2014, 87 patients were enrolled into the study (intention-to-treat population). At the time of the primary analysis (median follow-up 4·8 months [IQR 3·3-7·1]), 33 of 69 patients with measurable disease at baseline had a confirmed partial response; thus, the proportion of patients achieving an objective response by the independent review committee was 48% (95% CI 36-60). Adverse events were predominantly grade 1 or 2, most commonly constipation (31 [36%]), fatigue (29 [33%]), myalgia 21 [24%]), and peripheral oedema 20 [23%]). The most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were changes in laboratory values, including increased blood creatine phosphokinase (seven [8%]), increased alanine aminotransferase (five [6%]), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (four [5%]). Two patients died: one had a haemorrhage (judged related to study treatment), and one had disease progression and a history of stroke (judged unrelated to treatment). Alectinib showed clinical activity and was well tolerated in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who had progressed on crizotinib. Therefore, alectinib could be a suitable treatment for patients with ALK-positive disease who have progressed on crizotinib. F Hoffmann-La Roche.",cancer
533,NTRK1 fusions for the therapeutic intervention of Korean patients with colon cancer.,"The identification and clinical validation of cancer driver genes are essential to accelerate the translational transition of cancer genomics, as well as to find clinically confident targets for the therapeutic intervention of cancers. Here we identified recurrent LMNA-NTRK1 and TPM3-NTRK1 fusions in Korean patients with colon cancer (3 out of 147, 2%) through next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). NTRK1 fusions were mutually exclusive oncogenic drivers of colon cancer that were accompanied with in vitro potential of colony formation and in vivo tumorigenicity comparable to KM12, a human colon cancer cell line harboring TPM3-NTRK1 fusion. NTRK1-encoded TrkA protein was prevalent in 11 out of 216 Korean (5.1%) and 28 out of 472 Chinese patients (5.9%) from independent cohorts, respectively. The expression level of TrkA was significantly correlated with NTRK1 fusion (p = 0.0192), which was verified by a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Korean patients with TrkA-positive colon cancer had a marginal but significant shorter overall survival time than TrkA-negative colon cancer [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.5346, 95% confidential interval (CI) = 0.2548-0.9722, p = 0.0411]. In addition, KM12 cell line was sensitive to selective TrkA inhibitors. These results demonstrate that NTRK1 fusion is granted as a clinically relevant target for therapeutic intervention of colon cancer.",cancer
1201,Activating ALK mutations found in neuroblastoma are inhibited by Crizotinib and NVP-TAE684.,"Mutations in the kinase domain of ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) have recently been shown to be important for the progression of the childhood tumour neuroblastoma. In the present study we investigate six of the putative reported constitutively active ALK mutations, in positions G1128A, I1171N, F1174L, R1192P, F1245C and R1275Q. Our analyses were performed in cell-culture-based systems with both mouse and human ALK mutant variants and subsequently in a Drosophila melanogaster model system. Our investigation addressed the transforming potential of the putative gain-of-function ALK mutations as well as their signalling potential and the ability of two ATP-competitive inhibitors, Crizotinib (PF-02341066) and NVP-TAE684, to abrogate the activity of ALK. The results of the present study indicate that all mutations tested are of an activating nature and thus are implicated in tumour initiation or progression of neuroblastoma. Importantly for neuroblastoma patients, all ALK mutations used in the present study can be blocked by the inhibitors, although some mutants exhibited higher levels of drug sensitivity than others.",cancer
859,Comprehensive genomic analysis reveals FLT3 activation and a therapeutic strategy for a patient with relapsed adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia.,"The genomic events responsible for the pathogenesis of relapsed adult B-lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) are not yet clear. We performed integrative analysis of whole-genome, whole-exome, custom capture, whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq), and locus-specific genomic assays across nine time points from a patient with primary de novo B-ALL. Comprehensive genome and transcriptome characterization revealed a dramatic tumor evolution during progression, yielding a tumor with complex clonal architecture at second relapse. We observed and validated point mutations in EP300 and NF1, a highly expressed EP300-ZNF384 gene fusion, a microdeletion in IKZF1, a focal deletion affecting SETD2, and large deletions affecting RB1, PAX5, NF1, and ETV6. Although the genome analysis revealed events of potential biological relevance, no clinically actionable treatment options were evident at the time of the second relapse. However, transcriptome analysis identified aberrant overexpression of the targetable protein kinase encoded by the FLT3 gene. Although the patient had refractory disease after salvage therapy for the second relapse, treatment with the FLT3 inhibitor sunitinib rapidly induced a near complete molecular response, permitting the patient to proceed to a matched-unrelated donor stem cell transplantation. The patient remains in complete remission more than 4 years later. Analysis of this patient's relapse genome revealed an unexpected, actionable therapeutic target that led to a specific therapy associated with a rapid clinical response. For some patients with relapsed or refractory cancers, this approach may indicate a novel therapeutic intervention that could alter outcome.",cancer
1130,Correlation of p53 mutations with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy and shortened survival in ovarian cancer.,"The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a central role in cell cycle regulation and induction of apoptosis. We analyzed p53 alterations and their impact on response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in ovarian cancer patients. One hundred seventy-eight ovarian carcinomas, snap frozen and stored at -80 degrees C, were analyzed for mutations of the p53 gene (exons 2-11) by single-strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequencing and for p53 overexpression by immunohistochemistry (monoclonal antibody DO7). p53 mutations were found in 56% (99 of 178) of the tumors, and 62% of these were located in evolutionary highly conserved domains of the gene. Time to progression and overall survival were significantly shortened in patients with p53 mutations compared with wild-type p53 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.014) and patients with mutations in highly conserved domains as opposed to nonconserved domains or wild-type p53 (P = 0.010 and P = 0.007). p53 protein overexpression (>10% positively stained nuclei) was found in 62% (110 of 178). Time to progression and overall survival were shorter in cases with p53 overexpression (cutpoint, 10%: P = 0.071 and P = 0.056) but only marginally significant. Resistance to adjuvant cisplatin or carboplatin chemotherapy was significantly more frequent in patients with p53 overexpression (P = 0.001) or p53 missense mutations (P = 0.008) than patients with normal p53. p53 alterations correlate significantly with resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy, early relapse, and shortened overall survival in ovarian cancer patients in univariate analysis. In multivariable analysis though, p53 was not an independent prognostic factor.",cancer
1340,High IFN-γ Release and Impaired Capacity of Multi-Cytokine Secretion in IGRA Supernatants Are Associated with Active Tuberculosis.,"Interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assays (IGRAs) detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection regardless of the active (ATB) or latent (LTBI) forms of tuberculosis (TB). In this study, Mtb-specific T cell response against region of deletion 1 (RD1) antigens were explored by a microbead multiplex assay performed in T-SPOT TB assay (T-SPOT) supernatants from 35 patients with ATB and 115 patients with LTBI. T-SPOT is positive when over 7 IFN-γ secreting cells (SC)/250 000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are enumerated. However, over 100 IFN-γ SC /250 000 PBMC were more frequently observed in the ATB group compared to the LTBI group. By contrast, lower cytokine concentrations and lower cytokine productions relative to IFN-γ secretion were observed for IL 4, IL-12, TNF-α, GM-CSF, Eotaxin and IFN-α when compared to LTBI. Thus, high IFN-γ release and low cytokine secretions in relation with IFN-γ production appeared as signatures of ATB, corroborating that multicytokine Mtb-specific response against RD1 antigens reflects host capacity to contain TB reactivation. In this way, testing cytokine profile in IGRA supernatants would be helpful to improve ATB screening strategy including immunologic tests.",nonCancer
1577,The economic burden of common adverse events associated with metastatic colorectal cancer treatment in the United States.,"Adverse events (AEs) associated with treatments for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) may compromise the course of treatment, impact quality-of-life, and increase healthcare resource utilization. This study assessed the direct healthcare costs of common AEs among mCRC patients in the US.|Adult mCRC patients treated with chemotherapy or targeted therapies were identified from administrative claims databases (2009-2014). Up to the first three mCRC treatment episodes per patient were considered and categorized as with or without the AE system/organ category during the episode. Total healthcare costs (2014 USD) were measured by treatment episode and reported on a monthly basis. Treatment episodes with the AE category were matched by treatment type and line of treatment to those without the AE category. Adjusted total cost differences were estimated by comparing costs during treatment episodes with vs without the AE category using multivariate regression models; p-values were estimated with bootstrap.|A total of 4158 patients with ≥1 mCRC treatment episode were included (mean age = 59 years; 58% male; 60% with liver and 14% with lung metastases; 2,261 [54%] with a second and 1,115 [27%] with a third episode). On average, two treatment episodes were observed per patient with an average length of 166 days per episode. Adjusted monthly total cost difference by AE category included hematologic ($1,480), respiratory ($1,253), endocrine/metabolic ($1,213), central nervous system (CNS; $1,136), and cardiovascular ($1,036; all p < .05).|Claims do not include information on the cause of AEs, and potentially less severe AEs may not have been reported by the physician when billing the medical service. This study aimed to assess the association between costs and AEs and not the causation of AEs by treatment.|The most costly AEs among mCRC patients were hematologic, followed by respiratory, endocrine/metabolic, CNS, and cardiovascular.",nonCancer
341,Prognostic value of high EZH2 expression in patients with different types of cancer: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2) is a potential independent mechanism for epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes in cancer. We conducted an electronic search on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane library to perform this up-to-date meta-analysis. Fifty-one studies with a total of 9444 patients were included. The prevalence of high EZH2 expression was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.47-0.61). High EZH2 expression was significantly associated with poorer prognosis [overall survival: HR 1.54 (95% CI: 1.30-1.78), P < 0.000; disease free survival: HR 1.35 (95% CI: 1.00-1.71), P < 0.000]. In breast cancer, high EZH2 expression correlated with histological types [OR: 1.53 (95CI: 1.13-2.06); P < 0.006], histological grade [OR: 1.62 (95CI: 1.35-1.95); P < 0.000], estrogen receptor (ER) negativity [OR: 2.05 (95CI: 1.67-2.52); P < 0.000], progesterone receptor (PgR) negativity [OR: 1.42 (95CI: 1.03-1.96); P = 0.034], HER-2 positivity [OR: 1.35 (95CI: 1.08-1.69); P = 0.009], and high p53 expression [OR: 1.66 (95CI: 1.07-2.59); P = 0.024]. These results suggest that high EZH2 expression may be a promising prognostic factor to different cancers. High EZH2 expression tends to correlate with pathological types, histological grade, ER negativity, PgR negativity, HER-2 positivity and p53 high expression in breast cancer.",cancer
2459,Association between human papillomavirus and EGFR mutations in advanced lung adenocarcinoma.,"Previous studies have demonstrated an association between human papillomavirus (HPV) and mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in lung cancer patients; however, few studies have investigated this association in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients undergoing gefitinib treatment. The present study investigated the association between HPV and EGFR mutations in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients. A total of 95 advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients were enrolled in the study. The HPV infection status and presence of EGFR mutations in tumor tissue was evaluated. Patient clinical characteristics were also determined and compared with HPV infection and EGFR mutation status to analyze their impact on progression-free survival. HPV DNA was identified in 27/95 (28.4%) lung adenocarcinoma tumors and was most common in patients with lymph node metastasis (P=0.016). A total of 44/95 (46.3%) cases exhibited EGFR mutations, which were predominantly observed in female patients and non-smokers. The presence of HPV DNA was significantly associated with EGFR mutations (P=0.012) and multivariate analysis also revealed that HPV DNA was significantly associated with EGFR mutations (odds ratio=3.971) in advanced lung adenocarcinoma. Patients with both HPV infections and EGFR mutations exhibit a marked decrease in the risk of lung cancer progression when compared with those without HPV infection or EGFR mutations (adjusted HR=0.640; 95% confidence interval: 0.488-0.840; P=0.001). HPV infection was significantly associated with EGFR mutations in advanced lung adenocarcinoma patients. Furthermore, patients with HPV infections exhibited the longest progression-free survival times, which may be due to good response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor- or platinum-based-adjuvant therapy in these patients. Patients with EGFR mutations exhibited a better prognosis when compared with those exhibiting wild-type EGFR, regardless of HPV status.",nonCancer
126,Clinical predictors of response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer.,"The presence of EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) mutations is a robust predictor of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) responsiveness. Predictors of EGFR-TKI responsiveness in EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, however, have not been well investigated. The purpose of this study is to examine predictors of EGFR-TKI responsiveness in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients. Seventy EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who received EGFR-TKIs in our institution between April 2007 and March 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. The objective response rate was 50.0% (95% confidence interval, CI, 38.6-61.4%) and the disease control rate was 91.4% (95% CI, 82.5-96.0%). The median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival were 9.0 (95% CI, 3.92-14.08) and 20.8 months (95% CI, 14.56-27.04), respectively. In multivariate analysis, adenocarcinoma (hazard ratio, HR, 12.25; 95% CI, 37.7-41.10; p < 0.001) and major mutations (deletions in exon 19 and L858R point mutation in exon 21; HR, 2.46; 95% CI, 1.14-5.28; p = 0.022) were significant predictors of longer PFS. Major mutations and adenocarcinoma histology were independent predictors of better treatment outcome in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who received EGFR-TKIs. Further well-controlled prospective studies are warranted to confirm our findings.",cancer
2075,Turnera subulata Anti-Inflammatory Properties in Lipopolysaccharide-Stimulated RAW 264.7 Macrophages.,"In South America, particularly in the Northeastern regions of Brazil, Turnera subulata leaf extract is used as an alternative traditional medicine approach for several types of chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic pain, and general inflammation. Despite its widespread use, little is known about the medicinal properties of the plants of this genus. In this study, we evaluate the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory of T. subulata leaf extract in an in vitro model of inflammation, using lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW-264.7 macrophage cell line. We observed that cotreatment with T. subulata leaf extract was able to reduce the oxidative stress in cells due to inflammatory response. More importantly, we observed that the leaf extract was able to directly modulate inflammatory response by altering activity of members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. Our results demonstrate for the first time that T. subulata have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, which warrant further investigation of the medicinal potential of this species.",nonCancer
2158,Global profiling of protein complexes: current approaches and their perspective in biomedical research.,"Despite the rapid evolution of proteomic methods, protein interactions and their participation in protein complexes - an important aspect of their function - has rarely been investigated on the proteome-wide level. Disease states, such as muscular dystrophy or viral infection, are induced by interference in protein-protein interactions within complexes. The purpose of this review is to describe the current methods for global complexome analysis and to critically discuss the challenges and opportunities for the application of these methods in biomedical research.|We discuss advancements in experimental techniques and computational tools that facilitate profiling of the complexome. The main focus is on the separation of native protein complexes via size exclusion chromatography and gel electrophoresis, which has recently been combined with quantitative mass spectrometry, for a global protein-complex profiling. The development of this approach has been supported by advanced bioinformatics strategies and fast and sensitive mass spectrometers that have allowed the analysis of whole cell lysates. The application of this technique to biomedical research is assessed, and future directions are anticipated. Expert commentary: The methodology is quite new, and has already shown great potential when combined with complementary methods for detection of protein complexes.",nonCancer
1932,Tailor-made Stereoblock Copolymers of Poly(lactic acid) by a Truly Living Polymerization Catalyst.,"Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a biodegradable polymer prepared by the catalyzed ring opening polymerization of lactide. An ideal catalyst should enable a sequential polymerization of the lactide enantiomers to afford stereoblock copolymers with predetermined number and lengths of blocks. We describe a magnesium based catalyst that combines very high activity with a true-living nature, which gives access to PLA materials of unprecedented microstructures. Full consumption of thousands of equivalents of L-LA within minutes gave PLLA of expected molecular weights and narrow molecular weight distributions. Precise PLLA-b-PDLA diblock copolymers having block lengths of up to 500 repeat units were readily prepared within 30 min, and their thermal characterization revealed a stereocomplex phase only with very high melting transitions and melting enthalpies. The one pot sequential polymerization was extended up to precise hexablocks having 'dialed-in' block lengths.",nonCancer
430,Cyclin D1 overexpression is a negative predictive factor for tamoxifen response in postmenopausal breast cancer patients.,"Antioestrogen treatment by tamoxifen is a well-established adjuvant therapy for oestrogen receptor-alpha (ERalpha) positive breast cancer. Despite ERalpha expression some tumours do not respond to tamoxifen and we therefore delineated the potential link between the cell cycle regulator and ERalpha co-factor, cyclin D1, and tamoxifen response in a material of 167 postmenopausal breast cancers arranged in a tissue array. The patients had been randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen treatment or no treatment and the median follow-up time was 18 years. Interestingly in the 55 strongly ERalpha positive samples with moderate or low cyclin D1 levels, patients responded to tamoxifen treatment whereas the 46 patients with highly ERalpha positive and cyclin D1 overexpressing tumours did not show any difference in survival between tamoxifen and no treatment. Survival in untreated patients with cyclin D1 high tumours was slightly better than for patients with cyclin D1 low/moderate tumours. However, there was a clearly increased risk of death in the cyclin D1 high group compared to an age-matched control population. Our results suggest that cyclin D1 overexpression predicts for tamoxifen treatment resistance in breast cancer, which is line with recent experimental data using breast cancer cell lines and overexpression systems.",cancer
2036,c-Fos over-expression promotes radioresistance and predicts poor prognosis in malignant glioma.,"c-Fos is a major component of activator protein (AP)-1 complex. It has been implicated in cell differentiation, proliferation, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. To investigate the role of c-Fos in glioma radiosensitivity and to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we downregulated c-Fos gene expression by lentivirus-mediated shRNA in glioma cell lines and subsequently analyzed the radiosensitivity, DNA damage repair capacity, and cell cycle distribution. Finally, we explored its prognostic value in 41 malignant glioma patients by immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that silencing c-Fos sensitized glioma cells to radiation by increasing radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs), disturbing the DNA damage repair process, promoting G2/M cell cycle arrest, and enhancing apoptosis. c-Fos protein overexpression correlated with poor prognosis in malignant glioma patients treated with standard therapy. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism of radioresistance in malignant glioma and identify c-Fos as a potentially novel therapeutic target for malignant glioma patients.",nonCancer
1119,Wild-type KRAS is required for panitumumab efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Panitumumab, a fully human antibody against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), has activity in a subset of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Although activating mutations in KRAS, a small G-protein downstream of EGFR, correlate with poor response to anti-EGFR antibodies in mCRC, their role as a selection marker has not been established in randomized trials. KRAS mutations were detected using polymerase chain reaction on DNA from tumor sections collected in a phase III mCRC trial comparing panitumumab monotherapy to best supportive care (BSC). We tested whether the effect of panitumumab on progression-free survival (PFS) differed by KRAS status. KRAS status was ascertained in 427 (92%) of 463 patients (208 panitumumab, 219 BSC). KRAS mutations were found in 43% of patients. The treatment effect on PFS in the wild-type (WT) KRAS group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.59) was significantly greater (P < .0001) than in the mutant group (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.36). Median PFS in the WT KRAS group was 12.3 weeks for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks for BSC. Response rates to panitumumab were 17% and 0%, for the WT and mutant groups, respectively. WT KRAS patients had longer overall survival (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.82; treatment arms combined). Consistent with longer exposure, more grade III treatment-related toxicities occurred in the WT KRAS group. No significant differences in toxicity were observed between the WT KRAS group and the overall population. Panitumumab monotherapy efficacy in mCRC is confined to patients with WT KRAS tumors. KRAS status should be considered in selecting patients with mCRC as candidates for panitumumab monotherapy.",cancer

Dairy intake is among the dietary factors that have been studied, and they frequently, but not consistently nor conclusively, have shown to be protective factors for the development of overweight, obesity and their comorbidities. Current literature addresses the reason underlying the association between dairy intake and obesity from two explanatory lines: the contribution of these products to total energy intake and the influence of some of their nutritional components -mainly calcium, protein and fat- on the underlying processes for the development of this condition. The objective of this article is to review the current knowledge on these topics.",nonCancer
1012,Somatic aberrations of mismatch repair genes as a cause of microsatellite-unstable cancers.,"Lynch syndrome (LS) is caused by germline mutations in mismatch repair (MMR) genes, resulting in microsatellite-unstable tumours. Approximately 35% of suspected LS (sLS) patients test negative for germline MMR gene mutations, hampering conclusive LS diagnosis. The aim of this study was to investigate somatic MMR gene aberrations in microsatellite-unstable colorectal and endometrial cancers of sLS patients negative for germline MMR gene mutations. Suspected LS cases were selected from a retrospective Clinical Genetics Department diagnostic cohort and from a prospective multicentre population-based study on LS in The Netherlands. In total, microsatellite-unstable tumours of 40 sLS patients (male/female 20/20, median age 57 years) were screened for somatic MMR gene mutations by next-generation sequencing. In addition, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the affected MMR genes in these tumours as well as in 68 LS-associated tumours and 27 microsatellite-unstable tumours with MLH1 promoter hypermethylation was studied. Of the sLS cases, 5/40 (13%) tumours had two pathogenic somatic mutations and 16/40 (40%) tumours had a (likely) pathogenic mutation and LOH. Overall, LOH of the affected MMR gene locus was observed in 24/39 (62%) tumours with informative LOH markers. Of the LS cases and the tumours with MLH1 promoter hypermethylation, 39/61 (64%) and 2/21 (10%) tumours, respectively, demonstrated LOH. Half of microsatellite-unstable tumours of sLS patients without germline MMR gene mutations had two (likely) deleterious somatic MMR gene aberrations, indicating their sporadic origin. Therefore, we advocate adding somatic mutation and LOH analysis of the MMR genes to the molecular diagnostic workflow of LS.",cancer
1175,First-SIGNAL: first-line single-agent iressa versus gemcitabine and cisplatin trial in never-smokers with adenocarcinoma of the lung.,"Gefitinib has shown high response rate and improved progression-free survival (PFS) in never-smokers with lung adenocarcinoma (NSLAs). We compared efficacy of gefitinib with gemcitabine and cisplatin (GP) chemotherapy in this group of patients as first-line therapy. In this randomized phase III trial, a total of 313 Korean never-smokers with stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 to 2, and adequate organ function were randomly assigned to receive either gefitinib (250 mg daily) or GP chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8; cisplatin 80 mg/m(2) on day 1 every 3 weeks, for up to nine courses). The primary objective was to demonstrate better overall survival (OS) for gefitinib compared with GP in chemotherapy-naive NSLAs. Three hundred nine patients were analyzed per protocol (gefitinib arm, n = 159; GP arm, n = 150). Gefitinib did not show better OS compared with GP (hazard ratio [HR], 0.932; 95% CI, 0.716 to 1.213; P = .604; median OS, 22.3 v 22.9 months, respectively). The 1-year PFS rates were 16.7% with gefitinib and 2.8% with GP (HR, 1.198; 95% CI, 0.944 to 1.520). Response rates were 55% with gefitinib and 46% with GP (P = .101). Myelosuppression, renal insufficiency, and fatigue were more common in the GP arm, but skin toxicities and liver dysfunction were more common in the gefitinib arm. Two patients (1.3%) in the gefitinib arm developed interstitial lung disease and died. Gefitinib failed to demonstrate superior OS compared with GP as first-line therapy for NSLAs.",cancer
840,Akt phosphorylation associates with LOH of PTEN and leads to chemoresistance for gastric cancer.,"Growth factor receptor-mediated signal transduction has been implicated in conferring resistance to conventional chemotherapy on cancer cells. We describe a pathway that involves AKT/PI3K to mediate chemoresistance in gastric cancer patients. Primary gastric carcinoma tissues and corresponding normal mucosa were obtained from 76 gastric cancer patients who underwent surgery in the Department of Surgery II in Kyushu University Hospital from the years 1996-2000. AKT activation was investigated by immunostaining with a phosphorylation-specific antibody, and LOH (loss of heterozygosity) of PTEN was studied in the same samples. AKT was phosphorylated in 22 cases (28.9%) of gastric cancer cases. AKT and phosphorylated AKT were not correlated with any clinicopathological factor. We found that the gastric cancer patients who had higher AKT phosphorylation (activated AKT) seemed to have LOH of PTEN (p = 0.0008). When the chemotherapeutic sensibilities of these patients were studied in an MTT assay, it was found that the activated AKT was associated with increased resistance to multiple chemotherapeutic agents (5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, mitomycin C and cis-platinum). The results of our study indicate that AKT activation and LOH of PTEN plays an important role in conferring a broad-spectrum chemoresistance in gastric cancer patients. It also indicates that AKT may therefore be a novel molecular target for therapies or chemosensitivity tests that improve the outcomes of gastric cancer patients.",cancer
234,RAS point mutations and PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement in thyroid tumors: evidence for distinct molecular pathways in thyroid follicular carcinoma.,"A series of 88 conventional follicular and Hürthle cell thyroid tumors were analyzed for RAS mutations and PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangements using molecular methods and for galectin-3 and HBME-1 expression by immunohistochemistry. A novel LightCycler technology-based method was developed to detect point mutations in codons 12/13 and 61 of the H-RAS, K-RAS, and N-RAS genes. Forty-nine percent of conventional follicular carcinomas had RAS mutations, 36% had PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement, and only one (3%) had both. In follicular adenomas, 48% had RAS mutations, 4% had PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement, and 48% had neither. Follicular carcinomas with PAX8-PPAR gamma typically showed immunoreactivity for galectin-3 but not for HBME-1, tended to present at a younger patient age and be smaller size, and were almost always overtly invasive. In contrast, follicular carcinomas with RAS mutations most often displayed an HBME-1-positive/galectin-3-negative immunophenotype and were either minimally or overtly invasive. Hürthle cell tumors infrequently had PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement or RAS mutations. These results suggest that conventional follicular thyroid carcinomas develop through at least two distinct and virtually nonoverlapping molecular pathways initiated by either RAS point mutation or PAX8-PPAR gamma rearrangement.",cancer
2429,Physical exercise modulates the level of serum MMP-2 and MMP-9 in patients with breast cancer.,"Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) exhibit an important function in extracellular matrix degradation. MMPs modulate the activation of growth factors, cytokines and metastasis. At present, the effect of exercise on serum levels of MMP-2 and -9 remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of various physical activities on the circulating levels of MMP-2 and -9 in breast cancer (BC) survivors and healthy subjects. A total of 66 female subjects were enrolled in the present study. The cohort included 46 BC survivors and 20 healthy subjects divided into 5 groups: Group A (17 BC survivors, participating in recreational dragon boat paddling), group B (14 BC survivors, participating in recreational physical activity), group C (15 sedentary BC survivors), group D (10 healthy subjects, participating in recreational physical activity) and group E (10 sedentary healthy subjects). ELISA assays revealed a significant increase in the level of circulating MMP-2 in group B compared with all other groups. Recreational physical activity increased the levels of MMP-9 in healthy subjects (group D vs. E), however, the differences were not statistically significant, while in the BC survivor groups the results were opposite, with exercise reducing MMP-9 levels (group B vs. C). Furthermore, a significant increase in MMP-2 was observed in group B lymph node metastasis-positive (N+) subjects compared with group A and C N+ subjects. Thus, the results of the present study indicate that various physical activities modulate the levels of circulating MMP-2 and -9 in BC survivors, and the same exercise program induces a different effect when undertaken by healthy subjects and BC survivors. These results may have important implications with regard to the selection of appropriate physical activities for BC survivors, leading to improvements to their survival and prevention of recurrence, as well as amelioration of physical function, quality of life and fatigue.",nonCancer
2117,Photocatalytic decomposition behavior and reaction pathways of organic compounds using Cu nanoparticles synthesized via a green route.,"The present article depicts a green, facile and environmentally friendly biosynthetic methodology for the fabrication of Cu nanoparticles (Cu NPs) using an aqueous extract of Anas platyrhynchos egg shells. This method is free from the use of any external reducing agents, stabilizing agents, solvents and templates. The Cu NPs were characterized by UV-Vis, TEM, SAED, FTIR, XRD and SEM-EDX. The synthesized Cu NPs were predominantly spherical in nature with an average size of 5-18 nm. The EDX pattern revealed the presence of elemental copper in the Cu NPs. The prepared NPs were used for the remediation of three carcinogenic dyes, namely, Rose Bengal (RB), Methylene Blue (MB) and Methyl Violet 6B (MV6B) from aqueous solution. Approximately, 98.2, 93 and 96% of RB, MB and MV6B dye were degraded within 165, 135 and 150 min, respectively, using the synthesized Cu NPs. To acquire an improved understanding of the mechanistic details of the degradation products, the intermediates were identified using LC-MS. It is assumed that fragmentation of the oxy group takes place for RB, while for MB and MV6B, N-demethylation and N-demethylenation of the substituent on the amine group takes place. It is believed that finally, the conjugated chromophoric structure undergoes cleavage to form the mineralization products. The probable mechanisms for the degradation of the dyes have been presented. The high efficiency of NPs as photocatalysts has opened a promising application for the removal of hazardous dyes from industrial effluents.",nonCancer
1683,A vision for collaborative training infrastructure for bioinformatics.,"In biology, a missing link connecting data generation and data-driven discovery is the training that prepares researchers to effectively manage and analyze data. National and international cyberinfrastructure along with evolving private sector resources place biologists and students within reach of the tools needed for data-intensive biology, but training is still required to make effective use of them. In this concept paper, we review a number of opportunities and challenges that can inform the creation of a national bioinformatics training infrastructure capable of servicing the large number of emerging and existing life scientists. While college curricula are slower to adapt, grassroots startup-spirited organizations, such as Software and Data Carpentry, have made impressive inroads in training on the best practices of software use, development, and data analysis.

Therefore we performed a meta-analysis to derive a more precise conclusion. Six studies including 18241 subjects were identified by searching PubMed and Embase databases from inception to April 2016. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated under allele contrast, dominant, recessive, homozygous, and heterozygous models. All the analyses suggested a correlation of APOBEC3 deletion with increased breast cancer risk (D vs I: OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.23-1.36; D/D+I/D vs I/I: OR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.26-1.43; D/D vs I/D+ I/I: OR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.36-1.68; D/D vs I/I: OR = 1.75, 95% CI= 1.56-1.95; I/D vs I/I: OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.19-1.36). Stratified analysis by ethnicity showed that the relationship is stronger and more stable in Asians. In summary, our current work indicated that APOBEC3 copy number variations might have a good screening accuracy for breast cancer.",nonCancer

EGF104900 compared the activity of lapatinib alone or in combination with trastuzumab in patients with ErbB2-positive, trastuzumab-refractory metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Patients with ErbB2-positive MBC who experienced progression on prior trastuzumab-containing regimens were randomly assigned to receive either lapatinib alone or in combination with trastuzumab. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary efficacy end points included overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR; complete response, partial response, and stable disease for >/= 24 weeks), and overall survival (OS). In the intent-to-treat population (N = 296) who received a median of three prior trastuzumab-containing regimens, the combination of lapatinib with trastuzumab was superior to lapatinib alone for PFS (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57 to 0.93; P = .008) and CBR (24.7% in the combination arm v 12.4% in the monotherapy arm; P = .01). A trend for improved OS in the combination arm was observed (HR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.53 to 1.07; P = .106). There was no difference in ORR (10.3% in the combination arm v 6.9% in the monotherapy arm; P = .46). The most frequent adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and fatigue; diarrhea was higher in the combination arm (P = .03). The incidence of symptomatic and asymptomatic cardiac events was low (combination therapy = 2% and 3.4%; monotherapy = 0.7% and 1.4%, respectively). Despite disease progression on prior trastuzumab-based therapy, lapatinib in combination with trastuzumab significantly improved PFS and CBR versus lapatinib alone, thus offering a chemotherapy-free option with an acceptable safety profile to patients with ErbB2-positive MBC.",cancer
1035,Clinical correlation of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer genomics.,"Genomic studies in small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) lag far behind those carried out in nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To date, most SCLC studies have evaluated patients with surgically resectable disease. Here we sought to evaluate the genomic mutation spectrum of 'every-day' SCLC patient tumors with extensive stage disease (ES-SCLC) and to correlate mutations with the main clinical outcomes of response to chemotherapy, progression-free (PFS) and overall (OS) survival. A total of 50 SCLC patient tumors were examined in this study; targeted exome sequencing was obtained on 42 patients and whole-exome sequencing on 8 patients. Mutated genes were correlated with clinical outcomes using Kaplan-Meier methods (PFS, OS) and logistic regression (chemo-response). RB1 protein expression was detected by either western blotting of cultured cell lysates or immunohistochemistry of tumor specimens. In all, 39 patients had ES-SCLC; 15 patients had either primary refractory/resistant disease and 21 patients had sensitive disease. The two most frequently mutated genes were TP53 (86%) and RB1 (58%); other frequently mutated genes (>10% patients) were involved in epigenetic regulation as well as the mTOR pathway. We identified a number of low-frequency, targetable mutations, including RICTOR, FGFR1, KIT, PTCH1 and RET. Using multivariate analysis, RB1 was the only significant factor (P = 0.038) in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy, with an odds ratio of 5.58 comparing mutant RB1 with wild-type. Patients with mutant RB1 had both better OS (11.7 versus 9.1 months P = 0.04) and PFS (11.2 versus 8.6 months, P = 0.06) compared with patients with wild-type RB1. Interestingly, ∼25% of SCLC cell lines and tumor specimens expressed RB1 protein, possibly representing the subgroup with wild-type RB1. We found that SCLC tumors harboring no mutation in RB1 had a poor response to chemotherapy.",cancer
1117,Inhibition of MEK and PI3K/mTOR suppresses tumor growth but does not cause tumor regression in patient-derived xenografts of RAS-mutant colorectal carcinomas.,"Gene mutations along the Ras pathway (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) occur in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers (CRC) and correlate with poor response to anti-EGF receptor (EGFR) therapies. We assessed the effects of mitogen-activated protein (MAP)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) kinase (MEK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mTOR inhibitors, which neutralize the major Ras effectors, in patient-derived xenografts from RAS/RAF/PIK3CA-mutant metastatic CRCs (mCRC). Forty mCRC specimens harboring KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and/or PIK3CA mutations were implanted in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient (NOD/SCID) mice. Each xenograft was expanded into four treatment arms: placebo, the MEK inhibitor AZD6244, the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, BEZ235, or AZD6244 + BEZ235. Cases initially treated with placebo crossed over to AZD6244, BEZ235, and the anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody cetuximab. At the 3-week evaluation time point, cotreatment of established tumors with AZD6244 + BEZ235 induced disease stabilization in the majority of cases (70%) but did not lead to overt tumor regression. Monotherapy was less effective, with BEZ235 displaying higher activity than AZD6244 (disease control rates, DCRs: AZD6244, 27.5%; BEZ235, 42.5%). Triple therapy with cetuximab provided further advantage (DCR, 88%). The extent of disease control declined at the 6-week evaluation time point (DCRs: AZD6244, 13.9%; BEZ235, 16.2%; AZD6244 + BEZ235, 34%). Cross-analysis of mice harboring xenografts from the same original tumor and treated with each of the different modalities revealed subgroups with preferential sensitivity to AZD6244 (12.5%), BEZ235 (35%), or AZD6244 + BEZ235 (42.5%); another subgroup (10%) showed equivalent response to any treatment. The prevalent growth-suppressive effects produced by MEK and PI3K/mTOR inhibition suggest that this strategy may retard disease progression in patients. However, data offer cautionary evidence against the occurrence of durable responses.",cancer
815,Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harbor multiple potentially actionable kinase fusions.,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a neoplasm that typically occurs in children. The genetic landscape of this tumor is incompletely understood and therapeutic options are limited. Although 50% of IMTs harbor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, no therapeutic targets have been identified in ALK-negative tumors. We report for the first time that IMTs harbor other actionable targets, including ROS1 and PDGFRβ fusions. We detail the case of an 8-year-old boy with treatment-refractory ALK-negative IMT. Molecular tumor profiling revealed a ROS1 fusion, and he had a dramatic response to the ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib. This case prompted assessment of a larger series of IMTs. Next-generation sequencing revealed that 85% of cases evaluated harbored kinase fusions involving ALK, ROS1, or PDGFRβ. Our study represents the most comprehensive genetic analysis of IMTs to date and also provides a rationale for routine molecular profiling of these tumors to detect therapeutically actionable kinase fusions. Our study describes the most comprehensive genomics-based evaluation of IMT to date. Because there is no ""standard-of-care"" therapy for IMT, the identification of actionable genomic alterations, in addition to ALK, is expected to redefine management strategies for patients with this disease.",cancer
2201,Bacterial agents as a cause of infertility in humans.,"Infertility is a problem affecting almost 15% of couples. There are many causes for this condition, among which urogenital bacterial infections seem to play an important role. Many studies have explained the mechanisms by which bacteria cause infertility both in men and women. Therefore we undertook this study to evaluate the presence of genito-urinary infections in infertile couples who sought counselling to investigate their condition. Microbiological analysis was performed on semen and vaginal/cervical samples of both partners of each couple. The percentage of individuals affected by a urogenital bacterial infection was between 14 and 20%. More significantly, most of the species isolated both in men and women have been described in the literature as potential causes of infertility.",nonCancer
1812,Suppression of Vimentin Phosphorylation by the Avian Reovirus p17 through Inhibition of CDK1 and Plk1 Impacting the G2/M Phase of the Cell Cycle.,"The p17 protein of avian reovirus (ARV) causes cell cycle retardation in a variety of cell lines; however, the underlying mechanism(s) by which p17 regulates the cell cycle remains largely unknown. We demonstrate for the first time that p17 interacts with CDK1 and vimentin as revealed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation and GST pull-down assays. Both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that direct interaction of p17 and CDK1/vimentin was mapped within the amino terminus (aa 1-60) of p17 and central region (aa 27-118) of CDK1/vimentin. Furthermore, p17 was found to occupy the Plk1-binding site within the vimentin, thereby blocking Plk1 recruitment to CDK1-induced vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56. Interaction of p17 to CDK1 or vimentin interferes with CDK1-catalyzed phosphorylation of vimentin at Ser 56 and subsequently vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 82 by Plk1. Furthermore, we have identified upstream signaling pathways and cellular factor(s) targeted by p17 and found that p17 regulates inhibitory phosphorylation of CDK1 and blocks vimentin phosphorylation at Ser 56 and Ser 82. The p17-mediated inactivation of CDK1 is dependent on several mechanisms, which include direct interaction with CDK1, p17-mediated suppression of Plk1 by activating the Tpr/p53 and ATM/Chk1/PP2A pathways, and p17-mediated cdc25C degradation via an ubiquitin- proteasome pathway. Additionally, depletion of p53 with a shRNA as well as inhibition of ATM and vimentin by inhibitors diminished virus yield while Tpr and CDK1 knockdown increased virus yield. Taken together, results demonstrate that p17 suppresses both CDK1 and Plk1functions, disrupts vimentin phosphorylation, causes G2/M cell cycle arrest and thus benefits virus replication.",nonCancer
312,Durable complete response of metastatic gastric cancer with anti-Met therapy followed by resistance at recurrence.,"A 48 year-old female with chemo-refractory metastatic gastric cancer to the liver was treated on a Phase I clinical trial with MetMAb, a monoclonal antibody targeting the Met tyrosine kinase receptor. The primary tumor had high MET gene polysomy and evidence for an autocrine production of HGF, the growth factor ligand of Met. A complete response was obtained lasting two years; the cancer recurred as a peritoneal deposit invading into the transverse colon and a gastrohepatic ligament node. Compassionate use of MetMAb therapy at recurrence achieved a mixed response--a partial response of the two initial lesions, but with development of multiple new foci of carcinomatosis. Tissue and serum studies evaluating the Met signaling pathway did correlate with MetMAb treatment response initially and at the time of recurrence. This research brief is the first to describe a durable complete response obtained with a molecularly targeted monoclonal antibody, MetMAb, to the receptor tyrosine kinase, Met, in a patient with chemorefractory metastatic gastric cancer. It is also the first to report biomarkers that predicted therapeutic response to Met inhibition.",cancer
1321,Detrimental Effects of Higher Body Mass Index and Smoking Habits on Menstrual Cycles in Korean Women.,"Alteration of menstrual cycle by individual lifestyles and unfavorable habits may cause menstrual irregularity. We aimed to investigate the relationship between lifestyle factors and menstrual irregularity in Korean women using data from the Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES) 2010-2012.|This cross-sectional study included 3779 nondiabetic Korean women aged 19-49 years who did not take any oral contraceptives or sex hormonal compounds. We examined the association of menstrual irregularity with age, body mass index (BMI), drinking experience, and smoking habits.|Age, Asian BMI, marriage status, age at menarche, and smoking habits were significantly associated with menstrual cycle irregularity (p < 0.01). The prevalence of menstrual irregularity was significantly increased at younger ages: 18.4%, 10.3%, and 10.5% at 19-29, 30-39, and 40-49 years, respectively. Moreover, obesity groups, defined as per Asian BMI using modified WHO criteria, were strongly associated with menstrual irregularity. BMI 25.0-29.9 [obesity class I] (adjusted odds ratios [OR], 1.94; 95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.37-2.74) and ≥30.0 [obesity class II] (adjusted OR, 2.18; 95% CI, 1.22-3.91) presented significantly higher risk of menstrual irregularity compared with BMI 18.5-22.9 [normal weight]. Multivariable analysis revealed that high BMI in younger women aged 19-29 years (p < 0.001) and smoking habits in middle-aged women aged 30-39 years (p < 0.005) significantly predicted menstrual irregularity.|This study substantiated that menstrual irregularity was closely associated with higher BMI and smoking habits in nondiabetic Korean women. Weight loss and smoking cessation should be recommended to promote women's reproductive health.",nonCancer
1356,Pro-invasive effect of proto-oncogene PBF is modulated by an interaction with cortactin.,"Metastatic disease is responsible for the majority of endocrine cancer deaths. New therapeutic targets are urgently needed to improve patient survival rates.|The proto-oncogene PTTG1-Binding Factor (PBF/PTTG1IP) is overexpressed in multiple endocrine cancers and circumstantially associated with tumour aggressiveness. This study aimed to understand the role of PBF in tumour cell invasion and identify possible routes to inhibit its action. Design, Setting, Patients, and Interventions: Thyroid, breast and colorectal cells were transfected with PBF and cultured for in vitro analysis. PBF and cortactin (CTTN) expression was determined in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) and RNA-seq data (TCGA).|Pro-invasive effects of PBF were evaluated by 2D Boyden chamber, 3D organotypic and proximity ligation assays.|Our study identified that PBF and CTTN physically interact and co-localise, and that this occurs at the cell periphery, particularly at the leading edge of migrating cancer cells. Critically, PBF induces potent cellular invasion and migration in thyroid and breast cancer cells, which is entirely abrogated in the absence of CTTN. Importantly, we found that CTTN is over-expressed in DTC, particularly in patients with regional lymph node metastasis, which significantly correlates with elevated PBF expression. Mutation of PBF (Y174A) or pharmacological intervention modulates the PBF: CTTN interaction and attenuates the invasive properties of cancer cells.|Our results demonstrate a unique role for PBF in regulating CTTN function to promote endocrine cell invasion and migration, as well as identifying a new targetable interaction to block tumour cell movement.",nonCancer
328,Effects of AKT inhibitor therapy in response and resistance to BRAF inhibition in melanoma.,"The clinical use of BRAF inhibitors for treatment of metastatic melanoma is limited by the development of drug resistance. In this study we investigated whether co-targeting the MAPK and the PI3K-AKT pathway can prevent emergence of resistance or provide additional growth inhibitory effects in vitro. Anti-tumor effects of the combination of the BRAF inhibitor (BRAFi) dabrafenib and GSK2141795B (AKTi) in a panel of 23 BRAF mutated melanoma cell lines were evaluated on growth inhibition by an ATP-based luminescent assay, on cell cycle and apoptosis by flow cytometry and on cell signaling by western blot. Moreover, we investigated the possibilities of delaying or reversing resistance or achieving further growth inhibition by combining AKTi with dabrafenib and/or the MEK inhibitor (MEKi) trametinib by using long term cultures. More than 40% of the cell lines, including PTEN-/- and AKT mutants showed sensitivity to AKTi (IC50 < 1.5 μM). The combination of dabrafenib and AKTi synergistically potentiated growth inhibition in the majority of cell lines with IC50 > 5 nM dabrafenib. Combinatorial treatment induced apoptosis only in cell lines sensitive to AKTi. In long term cultures of a PTEN-/- cell line, combinatorial treatment with the MAPK inhibitors, dabrafenib and trametinib, and AKTi markedly delayed the emergence of drug resistance. Moreover, combining AKTi with the MAPK inhibitors from the beginning provided superior growth inhibitory effects compared to addition of AKTi upon development of resistance to MAPK inhibitors in this particular cell line. AKTi combined with BRAFi-based therapy may benefit patients with tumors harboring BRAF mutations and particularly PTEN deletions or AKT mutations.",cancer
1324,Perceived Benefits and Costs of Romantic Relationships for Young People: Differences by Adult Attachment Style.,"Bowlby's attachment theory suggested that the attachment experiences of early childhood influence adult approaches to close relationships. As a result of these experiences, the child develops typical mental schemas or internal working models. The aim of this study was to analyze how young people with different attachment styles perceive the benefits and costs involved in spending as much time as possible with their partner, and to determine whether their beliefs reflect the internal working models associated with their attachment style. A sample of 1,539 university students responded to the Relationship Questionnaire (Bartholomew & Horowith, 1991), and to a questionnaire about behavioral beliefs (perceived benefits and costs). Results show that young people with different attachment styles hold different beliefs about the consequences derived from engaging in a specific behavior in romantic relationships. Secure and preoccupied individuals perceived more benefits than costs associated with the behavior, whereas dismissing and fearful individuals perceived more costs than benefits. Furthermore, secure and preoccupied individuals rated those behavioral consequences leading to enhanced intimacy or closeness more positively than avoidant individuals, whereas dismissing individuals rated more negatively those consequences that involved a loss of independence. These results confirm that a congruity exists between the beliefs associated with the behavior studied and the internal working models related to each adult attachment style.",nonCancer
1489,Passive Entrapment of Tumor Cells Determines Metastatic Dissemination to Spinal Bone and Other Osseous Tissues.,"During the metastatic process tumor cells circulate in the blood stream and are carried to various organs. In order to spread to different organs tumor cell-endothelial cell interactions are crucial for extravasation mechanisms. It remains unclear if tumor cell dissemination to the spinal bone occurs by passive entrapment of circulating tumor cells or by active cellular mechanisms mediated by cell surface molecules or secreted factors. We investigated the seeding of three different tumor cell lines (melanoma, lung and prostate carcinoma) to the microvasculature of different organs. Their dissemination was compared to biologically passive microbeads. The spine and other organs were resected three hours after intraarterial injection of tumor cells or microbeads. Ex vivo homogenization and fluorescence analysis allowed quantification of tumor cells or microbeads in different organs. Interestingly, tumor cell distribution to the spinal bone was comparable to dissemination of microbeads independent of the tumor cell type (melanoma: 5.646% ± 7.614%, lung: 6.007% ± 1.785%, prostate: 3.469% ± 0.602%, 7 μm beads: 9.884% ± 7.379%, 16 μm beads: 7.23% ± 1.488%). Tumor cell seeding differed significantly between tumor cells and microbeads in all soft tissue organs. Moreover, there were significant differences between the different tumor cell lines in their dissemination behaviour to soft tissue organs only. These findings demonstrate that metastatic dissemination of tumor cells to spinal bone and other osseous organs is mediated by passive entrapment of tumor cells similar to passive plugging of microvasculature observed after intraarterial microbeads injection.",nonCancer
1288,Bisexual Invisibility and the Sexual Health Needs of Adolescent Girls.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze bisexual female youth perspectives on their experiences accessing sexual health information and services provided by a doctor, nurse, or counselor. Specifically, we sought to: (1) understand how youth perceptions of providers' attitudes and behaviors affect their seeking and obtaining sexual health information and services; (2) examine how social stigmas within the family context might be associated with barriers to sexual health information and services; and (3) assess school-based sources of sexual health information.|We utilized a mixed-method study design. Data from bisexual female youth were collected through an online questionnaire and asynchronous online focus groups addressing lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender health and HIV prevention. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and thematic analysis.|Barriers to sexual healthcare included judgmental attitudes and assumptions of patient heterosexuality among healthcare providers, and missed opportunities for HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STI) testing. Bisexual stigma within families was associated with restricted youth openness with providers, suggesting fear of disclosure to parent or guardian. School-based sexual health education was limited by a restrictive focus on abstinence and condoms and the exclusion of STI risk information relevant to sex between women.|We recommend that practitioners integrate nonjudgmental questions regarding bisexuality into standard contraceptive and sexual health practices involving female youth, including discussion of HIV and STI risk reduction methods. Further support for bisexual health among adolescent girls can come through addressing stigmas of female bisexuality, increasing sensitivity to privacy while engaging parents, and expanding the reach of school-based sexual health education.",nonCancer
1296,Evaluation of the in vitro push-out bond strengths of different post luting systems after artificial aging.,"Purpose of this study was to evaluate the push-out bond strengths of four commercially available adhesive luting systems (two self-adhesive and two etch-and-rinse systems) after mechanical aging.|Forty single-rooted anterior teeth were divided into four groups according to the luting cement system used: G1= Cement-One; G2= One-Q-adhesive Bond + Axia Core Dual; G3 = SmartCem 2; and G4 XP Bond + Core X flow. Anatomical Post were cemented in G1 and G2, and D.T. Light-Post Illusion were cemented in G3 and G4. All samples were subjected to masticatory stress simulation consisting of 300000 cycles applied with a computer-controlled chewing simulator. Push-out bond strength values (MPa) were calculated at cervical, middle, and apical each level, and the total bond strengths were calculated as the averages of the three levels. Statistical analysis was performed with data analysis software and significance was set at p<0.05.|Statistically significant differences in total bond strength were detected between the cements (G4=3.28 vs. G1=2.77 vs. G2=2.36 vs. G3=1.13 MPa; p<0.05). Specifically, G1 exhibited a lower bond strength in the apical zone, G3 exhibited a higher strength in this zone, and G2 and G4 exhibited more homogeneous bonding strengths across the different anatomical zones.|After artificial aging, etch-and-rinse luting systems exhibited more homogeneous bond strengths; nevertheless Cement-One exhibited a total bond strength second only to Core X Flow.",nonCancer
1571,Role of Tregs in Cancer Dormancy or Recurrence.,"The immunogenic tumor dormancy has been demonstrated in animal models of cancer, which can explain clinical observations such as an increased incidence of cancer following organ transplantation. The role of immune cell populations in the maintenance of, or escape from, tumor dormancy and subsequent recurrence is poorly understood. Here, we provide a review of literature related to the contribution of Tregs in tumor dormancy or recurrence. Based on clinical results, we suggest that anecdotal reports on the association of human Tregs with poor prognosis are circumstantial rather than implying a cause-effect direction. This could be due to a disparity among patients in harboring multiple factors associated with tumor immunoediting and immune evasion mechanisms.",nonCancer
558,Mutations of NOTCH1 are an independent predictor of survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"Analysis of the chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) coding genome has recently disclosed that the NOTCH1 proto-oncogene is recurrently mutated at CLL presentation. Here, we assessed the prognostic role of NOTCH1 mutations in CLL. Two series of newly diagnosed CLL were used as training (n = 309) and validation (n = 230) cohorts. NOTCH1 mutations occurred in 11.0% and 11.3% CLL of the training and validation series, respectively. In the training series, NOTCH1 mutations led to a 3.77-fold increase in the hazard of death and to shorter overall survival (OS; P < .001). Multivariate analysis selected NOTCH1 mutations as an independent predictor of OS after controlling for confounding clinical and biologic variables. The independent prognostic value of NOTCH1 mutations was externally confirmed in the validation series. The poor prognosis conferred by NOTCH1 mutations was attributable, at least in part, to shorter treatment-free survival and higher risk of Richter transformation. Although NOTCH1 mutated patients were devoid of TP53 disruption in more than 90% cases in both training and validation series, the OS predicted by NOTCH1 mutations was similar to that of TP53 mutated/deleted CLL. NOTCH1 mutations are an independent predictor of CLL OS, tend to be mutually exclusive with TP53 abnormalities, and identify cases with a dismal prognosis.",cancer
551,"Combining lapatinib (GW572016), a small molecule inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, with therapeutic anti-ErbB2 antibodies enhances apoptosis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells.","Antibodies and small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors targeting ErbB2 exhibit distinct, noncross resistant mechanisms of action. Here, apoptosis of ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cells was enhanced by combining lapatinib, an inhibitor of ErbB1 and ErbB2 tyrosine kinases, with anti-ErbB2 antibodies, including (i) trastuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody, and (ii) pAb, rabbit polyclonal antisera generated by vaccination with a human ErbB2 fusion protein. Treating ErbB2-overexpressing breast cancer cell lines with a relatively low concentration of lapatinib alone resulted in a minimal increase in tumor cell apoptosis with an associated decrease in steady-state protein levels of p-ErbB2, p-Akt, p-Erk1/2, and notably survivin, compared to baseline. Exposure to pAb alone reduced total ErbB2 protein, disrupting ErbB3 transactivation, leading to a marked inhibition of p-Akt; however, survivin protein levels remained unchanged and apoptosis only increased slightly. Treatment with trastuzumab alone had relatively little effect on survivin and apoptosis was unaffected. Combining lapatinib with either pAb or trastuzumab markedly downregulated survivin protein and enhanced tumor cell apoptosis. The association between the inhibition of survivin and enhanced apoptosis following the combination of ErbB2-targeted therapies provides a biological effect in order to identify therapeutic strategies that promote tumor cell apoptosis and might improve clinical response.",cancer
2525,"Structural and functional characterization of a highly stable endo-β-1,4-xylanase from Fusarium oxysporum and its development as an efficient immobilized biocatalyst.","Replacing fossil fuel with renewable sources such as lignocellulosic biomass is currently a promising alternative for obtaining biofuel and for fighting against the consequences of climate change. However, the recalcitrant structure of lignocellulosic biomass residues constitutes a major limitation for its widespread use in industry. The efficient hydrolysis of lignocellulosic materials requires the complementary action of multiple enzymes including xylanases and β-xylosidases, which are responsible for cleaving exo- and endoxylan linkages, that release oligocarbohydrates that can be further processed by other enzymes.|We have identified the endo-β-1,4-xylanase Xyl2 from Fusarium oxysporum as a promising glycoside hydrolase family 11 enzyme for the industrial degradation of xylan. To characterize Xyl2, we have cloned the synthetic optimized gene and expressed and purified recombinant Xyl2 to homogeneity, finally obtaining 10 mg pure Xyl2 per liter of culture. The crystal structure of Xyl2 at 1.56 Å resolution and the structure of a methyl-xylopyranoside Xyl2 complex at 2.84 Å resolution cast a highly detailed view of the active site of the enzyme, revealing the molecular basis for the high catalytic efficiency of Xyl2. The kinetic analysis of Xyl2 demonstrates high xylanase activity and non-negligible β-xylosidase activity under a variety of experimental conditions including alkaline pH and elevated temperature. Immobilizing Xyl2 on a variety of solid supports enhances the enzymatic properties that render Xyl2 a promising industrial biocatalyst, which, together with the detailed structural data, may establish Xyl2 as a platform for future developments of industrially relevant xylanases.|F. oxysporum Xyl2 is a GH11 xylanase which is highly active in free form and immobilized onto a variety of solid supports in a wide pH range. Furthermore, immobilization of Xyl2 on certain supports significantly increases its thermal stability.

Together, these properties render Xyl2 an attractive biocatalyst for the sustainable industrial degradation of xylan.",nonCancer
1346,Engineered Breast Cancer Cell Spheroids Reproduce Biologic Properties of Solid Tumors.,"Solid tumors develop as 3D tissue constructs. As tumors grow larger, spatial gradients of nutrients and oxygen and inadequate diffusive supply to cells distant from vasculature develops. Hypoxia initiates signaling and transcriptional alterations to promote survival of cancer cells and generation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) that have self-renewal and tumor-initiation capabilities. Both hypoxia and CSCs are associated with resistance to therapies and tumor relapse. This study demonstrates that 3D cancer cell models, known as tumor spheroids, generated with a polymeric aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) technology capture these important biological processes. Similar to solid tumors, spheroids of triple negative breast cancer cells deposit major extracellular matrix proteins. The molecular analysis establishes presence of hypoxic cells in the core region and expression of CSC gene and protein markers including CD24, CD133, and Nanog. Importantly, these spheroids resist treatment with chemotherapy drugs. A combination treatment approach using a hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, and a chemotherapy drug, doxorubicin, successfully targets drug resistant spheroids. This study demonstrates that ATPS spheroids recapitulate important biological and functional properties of solid tumors and provide a unique model for studies in cancer research.",nonCancer
456,p27 and BCL2 expression predicts response to chemotherapy in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.,"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) are characterized by marked heterogeneity in their biological behavior and response to treatment. Our goal was the identification of biomarkers that can be used to predict response to chemotherapy in these patients. The expression of EGFR, p53, Cyclin D1, p16, p21, p27, p-AKT, HIF-1α, Caspase 3 and BCL2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in 41 primary laryngeal/hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas of patients that received induction chemotherapy (cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil) as part of their treatment. Positive expression of p27 and BCL2 had a significant predictive value for chemotherapy response in univariate analysis. The combination of both proteins was not superior in predicting the response to chemotherapy. Furthermore, p27 expression was the only significant predictor of chemotherapy response in multivariate analysis (P=0.015). p27 Expression may serve as predictive biomarker of response to induction chemotherapy in HNSCC patients.",cancer
1398,P2Y12 Reaction Units Threshold for Implementing Modified Antiplatelet Preparation in Coil Embolization of Unruptured Aneurysms: A Prospective Validation Study.,"Purpose To identify and apply an optimized P2Y12 reaction units (PRU) threshold for implementing modified antiplatelet preparation to prevent thromboembolic events in patients nonresponsive to clopidogrel (clopidogrel nonresponders) undergoing coil embolization of unruptured aneurysms and to evaluate the clinical validity. Materials and Methods The optimal PRU threshold for prediction of thromboembolic events was determined with the Youden index in post hoc analysis of a previous, prospectively enrolled cohort of 165 patients in whom the antiplatelet regimen was not modified. This optimal PRU threshold was used to define clopidogrel nonresponders in a prospective validation study of 244 patients. Standard preparation (aspirin, clopidogrel) was maintained for 126 patients responsive to clopidogrel (clopidogrel responders, 51.6%), and modified preparation (aspirin, prasugrel) was prescribed prior to embolization for 118 clopidogrel nonresponders (48.4%). Fifty-seven clopidogrel nonresponders from the previous cohort who did not receive the modified preparation were included as a historical control group. Thromboembolic and bleeding events were compared among groups by using logistic regression analysis. Results Post hoc analysis from the previous cohort yielded PRU of at least 220 as the optimal threshold for modified preparation selection. The thromboembolic event rate of the clopidogrel responders (one of 126 [0.8%]) was lower than that of the historical control group that received standard preparation (seven of 57 patients [12.3%]; adjusted risk difference [RD], -10.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -18.5, -1.7; P = .015) and was similar to that of clopidogrel nonresponders who received modified preparation (one of 118 [0.8%]; adjusted RD, -0.5%; 95% CI: -3.1, 2.1; P = .001 for noninferiority; P = .699 for superiority). Bleeding event rates did not differ among groups (four of 126 clopidogrel responders [3.2%] vs four of 57 clopidogrel nonresponders that received standard preparation [7.0%] [adjusted RD, -4.5%; 95% CI: -11.1, 3.4; P = .228] vs five of 118 clopidogrel nonresponders that received modified preparation [4.2%] [adjusted RD, -0.6%; 95% CI: -5.8, 4.2; P = .813]).

2260,Ameliorating Effect of Ginseng on Epididymo-Orchitis Inducing Alterations in Sperm Quality and Spermatogenic Cells Apoptosis following Infection by Uropathogenic Escherichia coli in Rats.,"Epididymo-orchitis (EO) potentially results in reduced fertility in up to 60% of affected patients. The anti-inflammatory effects of Korean red ginseng (KRG) and its ability to act as an immunoenhancer in parallel with the beneficial effects of this ancient herbal medicine on the reproductive systems of animals and humans led us to evaluate its protective effects against acute EO.|This animal experimental study was conducted in the Department of Anatomical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Zanjan University of Medical Sciences (ZUMS), Zanjan, Iran during 2013-2015. We divided 50 Wistar rats into five following groups (n=10 per group): i. Control-intact animals, ii. Vehicle-phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injection into the vas deferens, iii. KRG-an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of KRG, iv. EO-an injection of uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) strain M39 into the vas defer- ens, and v. EO/ KRG-injections of both UPEC strain M39 and KRG. The treatment lasted seven days. We then evaluated sperm parameters, number of germ cell layers, Johnson's criteria, germ cell apoptosis, body weight and relative sex organs weight.|Acute EO increased the relative weight of prostate and seminal vesicles (P≤0.05). It also reduced sperm quality such as total motility, sperm concentration (P≤0.01), and the percentage of normal sperm (P≤0.001). Moreover, acute EO decreased Miller's (P≤0.05) and Johnsen's scores and increased apoptotic indexes of spermatogenic cells (P≤0.001). KRG treatment decreased prostate weight gain (P≤0.05) and improved the percentage of sperm with normal morphology, total motility (P≤0.01), and progressive motility (P≤0.05). The apoptotic indexes of spermatogenic cells reduced (P≤0.001), whereas both Johnsen's (P≤0.01) and Miller's criteria increased in the KRG-treated EO testis (P≤0.05).|Consequently, KRG ameliorated the devastating effects of EO on the sperm retrieved from either epididymis or testicle in rats.",nonCancer
1257,"Binimetinib versus dacarbazine in patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma (NEMO): a multicentre, open-label, randomised, phase 3 trial.","There are no established therapies specific for NRAS-mutant melanoma despite the emergence of immunotherapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of the MEK inhibitor binimetinib versus that of dacarbazine in patients with advanced NRAS-mutant melanoma. NEMO is an ongoing, randomised, open-label phase 3 study done at 118 hospitals in 26 countries. Patients with advanced, unresectable, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IIIC or stage IV NRAS-mutant melanoma who were previously untreated or had progressed on or after previous immunotherapy were randomised (2:1) to receive either binimetinib 45 mg orally twice daily or dacarbazine 1000 mg/m(2) intravenously every 3 weeks. Randomisation was stratified by stage, performance status, and previous immunotherapy. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by blinded central review in the intention-to-treat population. Safety analyses were done in the safety population, consisting of all patients who received at least one study drug dose and one post-baseline safety assessment. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01763164 and with EudraCT, number 2012-003593-51. Between Aug 19, 2013, and April 28, 2015, 402 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 269 to binimetinib and 133 to dacarbazine. Median follow-up was 1·7 months (IQR 1·4-4·1). Median progression-free survival was 2·8 months (95% CI 2·8-3·6) in the binimetinib group and 1·5 months (1·5-1·7) in the dacarbazine group (hazard ratio 0·62 [95% CI 0·47-0·80]; one-sided p<0·001). Grade 3-4 adverse events seen in at least 5% of patients the safety population in either group were increased creatine phosphokinase (52 [19%] of 269 patients in the binimetinib group vs none of 114 in the dacarbazine group), hypertension (20 [7%] vs two [2%]), anaemia (five [2%] vs six [5%]), and neutropenia (two [1%] vs ten [9%]). Serious adverse events (all grades) occurred in 91 (34%) patients in the binimetinib group and 25 (22%) patients in the dacarbazine group. Binimetinib improved progression-free survival compared with dacarbazine and was tolerable. Binimetinib might represent a new treatment option for patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma after failure of immunotherapy. Array BioPharma and Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation.",cancer
2089,Determination of Rhodium-Alkoxide Bond Strengths in Tp'Rh(PMe3)(OR)H.,"The active fragment [Tp'Rh(PMe3)], generated from a thermal precursor Tp'Rh(PMe3)(CH3)H, underwent oxidative addition of water and alcohols to give O-H adducts of the type Tp'Rh(PMe3)(OR)H (R = H, Me, Et, (n)Pr, (n)Bu, CH2Ph, (i)Pr, c-pentyl, CH2CF3, CH2CH2OH) at ambient temperature. These activation products eliminate water or alcohols in benzene, which allows determination of the relative metal-oxygen bond energies by using previously established kinetics techniques. Analysis of the relationship between the relative M-O bond strengths and O-H bond strengths showed a linear correlation with RM-O/O-H of 0.97 (3) for aliphatic alcohols. The two extraordinary substrates (R = CH2CF3, CH2CH2OH) both have stronger M-O bonds than would be predicted from this trend, suggesting the stabilization of the M-O bond when an electron-withdrawing substituent is present as previously seen in M-C bond strengths. In addition, the O-H activation products of aliphatic alcohols are thermally unstable at 80 °C, as rearrangement to form Tp'Rh(PMe3)H2 from β-elimination is observed after 1 or 2 d. Benzyl alcohol and 2,2,2-trifluoroethanol activation products were stable. For benzyl alcohol, although the O-H activation product was kinetically favored, the C-H activation products of the benzene ring were thermodynamically preferred.",nonCancer
1390,Regiocontrolled syntheses of FAHFAs and LC-MS/MS differentiation of regioisomers.,"An efficient regiospecific total synthesis of several branched fatty acyl hydroxyl-fatty acids (FAHFA) has been achieved from available terminal alkenes and alkynes. The key steps feature a boron trifluoride mediated epoxide ring opening with acetylide carbanions, followed by hydrogenation of the alkyne function. The carboxylic acid of the hydroxylated chains is introduced at the last step of the synthesis to allow the esterification of the branched hydroxyl group by fatty acids beforehand. The chemical syntheses of a ""linear"" FAHFA and a branched FAHFA analog containing a Z-olefin in the hydroxyl-fatty acid chain are also reported. A LC-MS/MS method has been developed.

2108,Effects of Long-Term Exposure to an Electronic Containment System on the Behaviour and Welfare of Domestic Cats.,"Free-roaming cats are exposed to a variety of risks, including involvement in road traffic accidents. One way of mitigating these risks is to contain cats, for example using an electronic boundary fence system that delivers an electric 'correction' via a collar if a cat ignores a warning cue and attempts to cross the boundary. However, concerns have been expressed over the welfare impact of such systems. Our aim was to determine if long-term exposure to an electronic containment system was associated with reduced cat welfare. We compared 46 owned domestic cats: 23 cats that had been contained by an electronic containment system for more than 12 months (AF group); and 23 cats with no containment system that were able to roam more widely (C group). We assessed the cats' behavioural responses and welfare via four behavioural tests (unfamiliar person test; novel object test; sudden noise test; cognitive bias test) and an owner questionnaire. In the unfamiliar person test, C group lip-licked more than the AF group, whilst the AF group looked at, explored and interacted more with the unfamiliar person than C group. In the novel object test, the AF group looked at and explored the object more than C group. No significant differences were found between AF and C groups for the sudden noise or cognitive bias tests. Regarding the questionnaire, C group owners thought their cats showed more irritable behaviour and AF owners thought that their cats toileted inappropriately more often than C owners. Overall, AF cats were less neophobic than C cats and there was no evidence of significant differences between the populations in general affective state. These findings indicate that an electronic boundary fence with clear pre-warning cues does not impair the long term quality of life of cats.",nonCancer
583,Targeting HER2 aberrations as actionable drivers in lung cancers: phase II trial of the pan-HER tyrosine kinase inhibitor dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified tumors.,"HER2 mutations and amplifications have been identified as oncogenic drivers in lung cancers. Dacomitinib, an irreversible inhibitor of HER2, EGFR (HER1), and HER4 tyrosine kinases, has demonstrated activity in cell-line models with HER2 exon 20 insertions or amplifications. Here, we studied dacomitinib in patients with HER2-mutant or amplified lung cancers. As a prespecified cohort of a phase II study, we included patients with stage IIIB/IV lung cancers with HER2 mutations or amplification. We gave oral dacomitinib at 30-45 mg daily in 28-day cycles. End points included partial response rate, overall survival, and toxicity. We enrolled 30 patients with HER2-mutant (n = 26, all in exon 20 including 25 insertions and 1 missense mutation) or HER2-amplified lung cancers (n = 4). Three of 26 patients with tumors harboring HER2 exon 20 mutations [12%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2% to 30%] had partial responses lasting 3+, 11, and 14 months. No partial responses occurred in four patients with tumors with HER2 amplifications. The median overall survival was 9 months from the start of dacomitinib (95% CI 7-21 months) for patients with HER2 mutations and ranged from 5 to 22 months with amplifications. Treatment-related toxicities included diarrhea (90%; grade 3/4: 20%/3%), dermatitis (73%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%), and fatigue (57%; grade 3/4: 3%/0%). One patient died on study likely due to an interaction of dacomitinib with mirtazapine. Dacomitinib produced objective responses in patients with lung cancers with specific HER2 exon 20 insertions. This observation validates HER2 exon 20 insertions as actionable targets and justifies further study of HER2-targeted agents in specific HER2-driven lung cancers. NCT00818441.",cancer
970,Pembrolizumab versus Chemotherapy for PD-L1-Positive Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"Background Pembrolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against programmed death 1 (PD-1) that has antitumor activity in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with increased activity in tumors that express programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Methods In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 305 patients who had previously untreated advanced NSCLC with PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells and no sensitizing mutation of the epidermal growth factor receptor gene or translocation of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene to receive either pembrolizumab (at a fixed dose of 200 mg every 3 weeks) or the investigator's choice of platinum-based chemotherapy. Crossover from the chemotherapy group to the pembrolizumab group was permitted in the event of disease progression. The primary end point, progression-free survival, was assessed by means of blinded, independent, central radiologic review. Secondary end points were overall survival, objective response rate, and safety. Results Median progression-free survival was 10.3 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.7 to not reached) in the pembrolizumab group versus 6.0 months (95% CI, 4.2 to 6.2) in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.68; P<0.001). The estimated rate of overall survival at 6 months was 80.2% in the pembrolizumab group versus 72.4% in the chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41 to 0.89; P=0.005). The response rate was higher in the pembrolizumab group than in the chemotherapy group (44.8% vs. 27.8%), the median duration of response was longer (not reached [range, 1.9+ to 14.5+ months] vs. 6.3 months [range, 2.1+ to 12.6+]), and treatment-related adverse events of any grade were less frequent (occurring in 73.4% vs. 90.0% of patients), as were grade 3, 4, or 5 treatment-related adverse events (26.6% vs. 53.3%). Conclusions In patients with advanced NSCLC and PD-L1 expression on at least 50% of tumor cells, pembrolizumab was associated with significantly longer progression-free and overall survival and with fewer adverse events than was platinum-based chemotherapy.

2532,Controlling DNA-End Resection: An Emerging Task for Ubiquitin and SUMO.,"DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are one of the most detrimental lesions, as their incorrect or incomplete repair can lead to genomic instability, a hallmark of cancer. Cells have evolved two major competing DSB repair mechanisms: Homologous recombination (HR) and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). HR is initiated by DNA-end resection, an evolutionarily conserved process that generates stretches of single-stranded DNA tails that are no longer substrates for religation by the NHEJ machinery. Ubiquitylation and sumoylation, the covalent attachment of ubiquitin and SUMO moieties to target proteins, play multifaceted roles in DNA damage signaling and have been shown to regulate HR and NHEJ, thus ensuring appropriate DSB repair. Here, we give a comprehensive overview about the current knowledge of how ubiquitylation and sumoylation control DSB repair by modulating the DNA-end resection machinery.",nonCancer

We aimed to assess the safety and tolerability of this drug in patients without BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations with advanced triple-negative breast cancer or high-grade serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian cancer. In this phase 2, multicentre, open-label, non-randomised study, women with advanced high-grade serous and/or undifferentiated ovarian carcinoma or triple-negative breast cancer were enrolled and received olaparib 400 mg twice a day. Patients were stratified according to whether they had a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation or not. The primary endpoint was objective response rate by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST). All patients who received treatment were included in the analysis of toxic effects, and patients who had measurable lesions at baseline were included in the primary efficacy analysis. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00679783. 91 patients were enrolled (65 with ovarian cancer and 26 breast cancer) and 90 were treated between July 8, 2008, and Sept 24, 2009. In the ovarian cancer cohorts, 64 patients received treatment. 63 patients had target lesions and therefore were evaluable for objective response as per RECIST. In these patients, confirmed objective responses were seen in seven (41%; 95% CI 22-64) of 17 patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 11 (24%; 14-38) of 46 without mutations. No confirmed objective responses were reported in patients with breast cancer. The most common adverse events were fatigue (45 [70%] of patients with ovarian cancer, 13 [50%] of patients with breast cancer), nausea (42 [66%] and 16 [62%]), vomiting (25 [39%] and nine [35%]), and decreased appetite (23 [36%] and seven [27%]). Our study suggests that olaparib is a promising treatment for women with ovarian cancer and further assessment of the drug in clinical trials is needed. AstraZeneca.",cancer
2512,"Short-term effects of β2-AR blocker ICI 118,551 on sarcoplasmic reticulum SERCA2a and cardiac function of rats with heart failure.","The study was conducted to examine the effects of ICI 118,551 on the systolic function of cardiac muscle cells of rats in heart failure and determine the molecular mechanism of selective β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) antagonist on these cells. The chronic heart failure model for rats was prepared through abdominal aortic constriction and separate cardiac muscle cells using the collagenase digestion method. The rats were then divided into Sham, HF and HF+ICI 50 nM goups and cultivated for 48 h. β2-AR, Gi/Gs and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA2a) protein expression levels in the cardiac muscle cells were evaluated by western blotting and changes in the systolic function of cardiac muscle cells based on the boundary detection system of contraction dynamics for individual cells was measured. The results showed that compared with the Sham group, the survival rate, percentage of basic contraction and maximum contraction amplitude percentage of cardiac muscle cells with heart failure decreased, Gi protein expression increased while Gs and SERCA2a protein expression decreased. Compared with the HF group, the maximum contraction amplitude percentage of cardiac muscle cells in group HF+ICI 50 nM decreased, the Gi protein expression level increased while the SERCA2a protein expression level decreased. Following the stimulation of Ca(2+) and ISO, the maximum contraction amplitude percentage of cardiac muscle cells in the HF+ICI 50 nM group was lower than that in group HF. This indicated that ICI 118,551 has negative inotropic effects on cardiac muscle cells with heart failure, which may be related to Gi protein. Systolic function of cardiac muscle cells with heart failure can therefore be reduced by increasing Gi protein expression and lowering SERCA2a protein expression.",nonCancer

Vemurafenib, an oncogenic BRAF kinase inhibitor approved for BRAF-positive melanoma, showed clinical benefit in three patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer in a phase 1 trial. We aimed to establish the activity of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer. We did an open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 trial at ten academic centres and hospitals worldwide in patients aged 18 years or older with histologically confirmed recurrent or metastatic papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine and positive for the BRAF(V600E) mutation. Participants either had never received a multikinase inhibitor targeting VEGFR (cohort 1) or had been treated previously with a VEGFR multikinase inhibitor (cohort 2). Patients received vemurafenib 960 mg orally twice daily. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed best overall response in cohort 1 (confirmed on two assessments 4 weeks or longer apart). Analyses were planned to have a minimum median follow-up of 15 months (data cutoff April 18, 2014) and were done in safety, intention-to-treat, and per-protocol populations. This trial is closed and is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01286753. Between June 23, 2011, and Jan 15, 2013, 51 patients were enrolled to the study, 26 in cohort 1 and 25 in cohort 2. Median duration of follow-up was 18·8 months (IQR 14·2-26·0) in cohort 1 and 12·0 months (6·7-20·3) in cohort 2. Partial responses were recorded in ten of 26 patients in cohort 1 (best overall response 38·5%, 95% CI 20·2-59·4). Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were recorded in 17 (65%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2; the most common grade 3 and 4 adverse events were squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (seven [27%] in cohort 1, five [20%] in cohort 2), lymphopenia (two [8%] in each cohort), and increased γ-glutamyltransferase (one [4%] in cohort 1, three [12%] in cohort 2). Two individuals in cohort 2 died due to adverse events, one from dyspnoea and one from multiorgan failure, but neither was treatment related. Serious adverse events were reported for 16 (62%) of 26 patients in cohort 1 and 17 (68%) of 25 patients in cohort 2. Vemurafenib showed antitumour activity in patients with progressive, BRAF(V600E)-positive papillary thyroid cancer refractory to radioactive iodine who had never been treated with a multikinase inhibitor. As such, this agent represents a potential new treatment option for these patients. F Hoffmann-La Roche.",cancer
404,The FNTB promoter polymorphism rs11623866 as a potential predictive biomarker for lonafarnib treatment of ovarian cancer patients.,"Despite promising preclinical findings regarding clinical utility of farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI), such as lonafarnib, success of clinical trials is limited. A multicentre AGO-OVAR-15 phase II trial reported an unfavourable effect of lonafarnib on the outcome of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. This study was performed as a genetic subgroup analysis of the AGO-OVAR-15 trial, and investigated the utility of the promoter polymorphism rs11623866 of the farnesyltransferase ß-subunit gene (FNTB) in predicting the clinical effectiveness of lonafarnib. The influence of rs11623866 (c.-609G > C) on FNTB promoter activity was investigated by electrophoretic-mobility-shift assay, luciferase-reporter assay and RT-qPCR. A total of 57 out of 105 patients from the AGO-OVAR-15 trial, treated with carboplatin and paclitaxel ± lonafarnib, was genotyped for rs11623866 by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. Genotype-dependent survival analysis was performed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. The presence of the G allele was associated with increased FNTB promoter activity compared with the C allele. An unfavourable effect of lonafarnib was limited to patients carrying a GG genotype (HRPFS 6.2, 95%CI = 2.01, 19.41, P = 0.002; HROS 9.6, 95%CI = 1.89, 48.54, P = 0.006). Median progression free survival (PFS) for patients with the GG genotype in the lonafarnib treated arm was 10 months, whereas median PFS without FTI-treatment was 40 months. Median overall survival (OS) in the lonafarnib-treated group was 19 months, whereas median OS was not reached in the untreated group. Discrepancies between preclinical success and clinical failure may be due to the patients' genetic variability of FNTB. Therefore, our results may encourage retrospective evaluation of FNTB polymorphisms in previous FTI studies, especially those reporting positive FTI response.",cancer

1924,The iron chelator deferasirox induces apoptosis by targeting oncogenic Pyk2/β-catenin signaling in human multiple myeloma.,"Deregulated iron metabolism underlies the pathogenesis of many human cancers. Recently, low expression of ferroportin, which is the only identified non-heme iron exporter, has been associated with significantly reduced overall survival in multiple myeloma (MM); however, the altered iron metabolism in MM biology remains unclear. In this study we demonstrated, by live cell imaging, that MM cells have increased intracellular iron levels as compared with normal cells. In experiments to test the effect of iron chelation on the growth of MM cells, we found that deferasirox (DFX), an oral iron chelator used to treat iron overload in clinical practice, inhibits MM cell growth both in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, DFX was found to induce apoptosis of MM cells via the inhibition of proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2), which is known to promote tumor growth in MM. Inhibition of Pyk2 is caused by the suppression of reactive oxygen species, and leads to downregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Taken together, our findings indicate that high levels of intracellular iron, which might be due to low ferroportin expression, play a role in MM pathophysiology. Therefore, DFX may provide a therapeutic option for MM that is driven by deregulated iron homeostasis and/or Pyk2/Wnt signaling.",nonCancer
1930,Loss of phosphodiesterase 4D mediates acquired triapine resistance via Epac-Rap1-Integrin signaling.,"Triapine, an anticancer thiosemicarbazone, is currently under clinical investigation. Whereas promising results were obtained in hematological diseases, trials in solid tumors widely failed. To understand mechanisms causing triapine insensitivity, we have analysed genomic alterations in a triapine-resistant SW480 subline (SW480/tria). Only one distinct genomic loss was observed specifically in SW480/tria cells affecting the phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) gene locus. Accordingly, pharmacological inhibition of PDE4D resulted in significant triapine resistance in SW480 cells. Hence, we concluded that enhanced cyclic AMP levels might confer protection against triapine. Indeed, hyperactivation of both major downstream pathways, namely the protein kinase A (PKA)-cAMP response element-binding protein (Creb) and the exchange protein activated by cAMP (Epac)-Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1) signaling axes, was observed in SW480/tria cells. Unexpectedly, inhibition of PKA did not re-sensitize SW480/tria cells against triapine. In contrast, Epac activation resulted in distinct triapine resistance in SW480 cells. Conversely, knock-down of Epac expression and pharmacological inhibition of Rap1 re-sensitized SW480/tria cells against triapine. Rap1 is a well-known regulator of integrins. Accordingly, SW480/tria cells displayed enhanced plasma membrane expression of several integrin subunits, enhanced adhesion especially to RGD-containing matrix components, and bolstered activation/expression of the integrin downstream effectors Src and RhoA/Rac. Accordingly, integrin and Src inhibition resulted in potent triapine re-sensitization especially of SW480/tria cells. In summary, we describe for the first time integrin activation based on cAMP-Epac-Rap1 signaling as acquired drug resistance mechanism. combinations of triapine with inhibitors of several steps in this resistance cascade might be feasible strategies to overcome triapine insensitivity of solid tumors.",nonCancer
869,RUNX1 mutations in acute myeloid leukemia are associated with distinct clinico-pathologic and genetic features.,"We evaluated the frequency, genetic architecture, clinico-pathologic features and prognostic impact of RUNX1 mutations in 2439 adult patients with newly-diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). RUNX1 mutations were found in 245 of 2439 (10%) patients; were almost mutually exclusive of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities; and they co-occurred with a complex pattern of gene mutations, frequently involving mutations in epigenetic modifiers (ASXL1, IDH2, KMT2A, EZH2), components of the spliceosome complex (SRSF2, SF3B1) and STAG2, PHF6, BCOR. RUNX1 mutations were associated with older age (16-59 years: 8.5%; ⩾60 years: 15.1%), male gender, more immature morphology and secondary AML evolving from myelodysplastic syndrome. In univariable analyses, RUNX1 mutations were associated with inferior event-free (EFS, P<0.0001), relapse-free (RFS, P=0.0007) and overall survival (OS, P<0.0001) in all patients, remaining significant when age was considered. In multivariable analysis, RUNX1 mutations predicted for inferior EFS (P=0.01). The effect of co-mutation varied by partner gene, where patients with the secondary genotypes RUNX1(mut)/ASXL1(mut) (OS, P=0.004), RUNX1(mut)/SRSF2(mut) (OS, P=0.007) and RUNX1(mut)/PHF6(mut) (OS, P=0.03) did significantly worse, whereas patients with the genotype RUNX1(mut)/IDH2(mut) (OS, P=0.04) had a better outcome. In conclusion, RUNX1-mutated AML is associated with a complex mutation cluster and is correlated with distinct clinico-pathologic features and inferior prognosis.",cancer
177,Detection of a recurrent DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is a rare liver tumor affecting adolescents and young adults with no history of primary liver disease or cirrhosis. We identified a chimeric transcript that is expressed in FL-HCC but not in adjacent normal liver and that arises as the result of a ~400-kilobase deletion on chromosome 19. The chimeric RNA is predicted to code for a protein containing the amino-terminal domain of DNAJB1, a homolog of the molecular chaperone DNAJ, fused in frame with PRKACA, the catalytic domain of protein kinase A. Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analyses confirmed that the chimeric protein is expressed in tumor tissue, and a cell culture assay indicated that it retains kinase activity. Evidence supporting the presence of the DNAJB1-PRKACA chimeric transcript in 100% of the FL-HCCs examined (15/15) suggests that this genetic alteration contributes to tumor pathogenesis.",cancer
852,Use of whole-genome sequencing to diagnose a cryptic fusion oncogene.,"Whole-genome sequencing is becoming increasingly available for research purposes, but it has not yet been routinely used for clinical diagnosis. To determine whether whole-genome sequencing can identify cryptic, actionable mutations in a clinically relevant time frame. We were referred a difficult diagnostic case of acute promyelocytic leukemia with no pathogenic X-RARA fusion identified by routine metaphase cytogenetics or interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The case patient was enrolled in an institutional review board-approved protocol, with consent specifically tailored to the implications of whole-genome sequencing. The protocol uses a ""movable firewall"" that maintains patient anonymity within the entire research team but allows the research team to communicate medically relevant information to the treating physician. Clinical relevance of whole-genome sequencing and time to communicate validated results to the treating physician. Massively parallel paired-end sequencing allowed identification of a cytogenetically cryptic event: a 77-kilobase segment from chromosome 15 was inserted en bloc into the second intron of the RARA gene on chromosome 17, resulting in a classic bcr3 PML-RARA fusion gene. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction sequencing subsequently validated the expression of the fusion transcript. Novel FISH probes identified 2 additional cases of t(15;17)-negative acute promyelocytic leukemia that had cytogenetically invisible insertions.

Refractive indices have been measured at two temperatures and used to estimate ice densities and infrared band strengths. Vapor pressures for the two crystalline phases of CH3SH at 110 K are estimated. The behavior of amorphous CH3SH on warming is presented and discussed in terms of Ostwald's step rule. Comparisons to CH3OH under similar conditions are made, and some inconsistencies and ambiguities in the CH3SH literature are examined and corrected.",nonCancer
518,Clinical activity of afatinib (BIBW 2992) in patients with lung adenocarcinoma with mutations in the kinase domain of HER2/neu.,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER)2/neu kinase domain mutations are found in approximately 1-4% of lung adenocarcinomas with a similar phenotype to tumors with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. Afatinib is a potent irreversible ErbB family blocker. We determined the tumor genomic status of the EGFR and HER2 genes in non- or light smokers with lung adenocarcinoma in patients who were entered into an exploratory Phase II study with afatinib. Five patients with a non-smoking history and metastatic lung adenocarcinomas bearing mutations in the kinase domain of HER2 gene were identified, three of which were evaluable for response. Objective response was observed in all three patients, even after failure of other EGFR- and/or HER2-targeted treatments; the case histories of these patients are described in this report. These findings suggest that afatinib is a potential novel treatment option for this subgroup of patients, even when other EGFR and HER2 targeting treatments have failed.",cancer
1717,The per-protocol effect of immediate vs. deferred ART initiation in the START randomized trial.,"The START trial found a lower risk of a composite clinical outcome in HIV-positive individuals assigned to immediate initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) compared with those assigned to deferred initiation. However, 30% of those assigned to deferred initiation started ART earlier than the protocol specified. To supplement the published intention-to-treat effect estimates, here we estimate the per-protocol effect of immediate versus deferred ART initiation in START.|The START trial randomized 4685 HIV-positive participants with CD4 counts > 500 /mm to start ART immediately after randomization (immediate initiation group) or to wait until the CD4 count dropped below 350 cells/mm or an AIDS diagnosis (deferred initiation group).|We used the parametric g-formula to estimate and compare the cumulative 5-year risk of the composite clinical outcome in the immediate and deferred initiation groups had all the trial participants adhered to the protocol.|We estimated that the 5-year risk of the composite outcome would have been 3.2% under immediate ART initiation and 7.0% under deferred initiation. The difference of 3.8% (95% confidence interval 1.5,6.5) was larger than the intention-to-treat effect estimate of 3.1%, corresponding to a difference in effect estimates of 0.72% (-0.35,2.35).|The intention-to-treat effect estimate may underestimate the benefit of immediate ART initiation by 23%. This estimate can be used by patients and policy makers who need to understand the full extent of the benefit of changes in ART initiation policies.",nonCancer

We analyzed the genotype-phenotype relationships in these and 70 previously described patients.|The mean seizure onset age was 1.8 ± 1.6 (SD) days. Of the 20 EEGs obtained within a week of birth, 11 showed burst suppression. When new seizure types appeared in infancy (15 patients), the most common were epileptic spasms (n = 8). At last follow-up, seizures persisted in 9 patients. Development was delayed in all, severely in 14. The KCNQ2 variants identified introduced amino acid missense changes or, in one instance, a single residue deletion. They were clustered in 4 protein subdomains predicted to poison tetrameric channel functions. EZO use (assessed by the treating physicians and parents) was associated with improvement in seizures and/or development in 3 of the 4 treated before 6 months of age, and 2 of the 7 treated later; no serious side effects were observed.|KCNQ2 variants cause neonatal-onset epileptic encephalopathy of widely varying severity. Pathogenic variants in epileptic encephalopathy are clustered in ""hot spots"" known to be critical for channel activity. For variants causing KCNQ2 channel loss of function, EZO appeared well tolerated and potentially beneficial against refractory seizures when started early. Larger, prospective studies are needed to enable better definition of prognostic categories and more robust testing of novel interventions.|This study provides Class IV evidence that EZO is effective for refractory seizures in patients with epilepsy due to KCNQ2 encephalopathy.",nonCancer
1637,The effect of intravertebral anesthesia on bone cement implantation syndrome in aged patients: A single-center 5-year retrospective study.,"The aim of the study was to assess the effect of commonly used intravertebral anesthesia on bone cement implantation syndrome (BCIS) in aged patients undergoing hemiarthroplasty.The medical records of 1210 aged patients receiving hemiarthroplasty under intravertebral anesthesia were retrospectively reviewed. Anesthesia charts for all patients were reviewed for central venous pressure, mean arterial pressure, arterial oxygen saturation, and heart rate before, during, and after cementation. Each patient was classified into no BCIS (grade 0) or BCIS grade 1, 2, or 3 according to the degree of hypotension, arterial desaturation, or loss of consciousness around cementation. Changes in these grades after cementation were compared according to the ways of intravertebral anesthesia used.Among all included patients, 72.2% (874/1210) showed grade 1 or higher grade of BCIS after cementation. Compared with spinal-epidural anesthesia, single epidural anesthesia showed adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of 1.25 (1.13-1.43) for grade 1, 1.36 (0.83-2.06) for grade 2, and 3.55 (1.52-7.06) for marked postoperatively grade 3 of BCIS versus grade 0 (Type III P < 0.0001).Single epidural anesthesia was associated with increased odds for elevation of these grades after cementation compared with spinal-epidural anesthesia.",nonCancer
2494,Analysis on distribution features and drug resistance of clinically isolated Acinetobacter baumannii.,"The aim of the present study was to examine the clinical distribution and drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii infection, and provide evidence of clinical medication as well as the prophylaxis for the treatment of drug resistance bacteria. In total, 306 Acinetobacter baumanniis selected from routine culture were collected between January 2012 and December 2013, to analyze the distributions among clinical specimens and wards and their drug resistance state. Of the 306 Acinetobacter baumanniis, the main distribution of specimens was sputum, accounting for 77.78%. The distribution of administrative office was dominated by intensive care unit with a proportion of 40.0% in 2012, which rapidly increased to 60.9% in 2013, followed by neurosurgery, respiration medicine and orthopedics with proportions of 23, 12 and 9.0% in 2012 and 9.71, 8.74 and 3.88% in 2013, respectively. The Acinetobacter baumannii's drug resistance rate of Tazobactam and Piperacillin was increased from 68.0% in 2012 to 71.36% in 2013. At the same time, the drug resistance rate of imipenem was enhanced from 66.0% in 2012 to 72.81% in 2013. By 2013, the drug resistance rates of penbritin, ceftizoxime, cefotetan and macrodantin reached ≤100%. In conclusion, Acinetobacter baumannii mainly causes respiratory tract infection with severe drug resistance. The drug resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii was mainly manifested as multidrug resistance or even pan-drug resistance with an obvious increasing trend of tolerance. Thus, it is necessary to prevent and treat nosocomial infection, to minimize usage of antibiotics and to standardize medical operating, to reduce the increase in persistence.",nonCancer

755,Novel ALK inhibitor AZD3463 inhibits neuroblastoma growth by overcoming crizotinib resistance and inducing apoptosis.,"ALK receptor tyrosine kinase has been shown to be a therapeutic target in neuroblastoma. Germline ALK activating mutations are responsible for the majority of hereditary neuroblastoma and somatic ALK activating mutations are also frequently observed in sporadic cases of advanced NB. Crizotinib, a first-line therapy in the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ALK rearrangements, demonstrates striking efficacy against ALK-rearranged NB. However, crizotinib fails to effectively inhibit the activity of ALK when activating mutations are present within its kinase domain, as with the F1174L mutation. Here we show that a new ALK inhibitor AZD3463 effectively suppressed the proliferation of NB cell lines with wild type ALK (WT) as well as ALK activating mutations (F1174L and D1091N) by blocking the ALK-mediated PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and ultimately induced apoptosis and autophagy. In addition, AZD3463 enhanced the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin on NB cells. AZD3463 also exhibited significant therapeutic efficacy on the growth of the NB tumors with WT and F1174L activating mutation ALK in orthotopic xenograft mouse models. These results indicate that AZD3463 is a promising therapeutic agent in the treatment of NB.",cancer
2462,Dihydroartemisinin induces endothelial cell anoikis through the activation of the JNK signaling pathway.,"Angiogenesis is required for the growth and metastasis of solid tumors. The anti-malarial agent dihydroartemisinin (DHA) demonstrates potent anti-angiogenic activity, but the underlying molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. During the process of angiogenesis, endothelial cells migrating from existing capillaries may undergo programmed cell death after detaching from the extracellular matrix, a process that is defined as anchorage-dependent apoptosis or anoikis. In the present study, DHA-induced cell death was compared in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in suspension and attached to culture plates. In suspended HUVECs, the cell viability was decreased and apoptosis was increased with the treatment of 50 µM DHA for 5 h, while the same treatment did not affect the attached HUVECs. In addition, 50 µM DHA increased the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in suspended HUVECs, but not in attached HUVECs, for up to 5 h of treatment. The JNK inhibitor, SP600125, reversed DHA-induced cell death in suspended HUVECs, suggesting that the JNK pathway may mediate DHA-induced endothelial cell anoikis. The data from the present study indicates a novel mechanism for understanding the anti-angiogenic effects of DHA, which may be used as a component for chemotherapy.",nonCancer
1250,Hyper-progressors after Immunotherapy: Analysis of Genomic Alterations Associated with Accelerated Growth Rate.,"Checkpoint inhibitors demonstrate salutary anti-cancer effects including long-term remissions. PD-L1 expression/amplification, high mutational burden and mismatch repair-deficiency correlate with response. We have, however, observed a subset of patients who appear to be ""hyper-progressors,"" with a greatly accelerated rate of tumor growth and clinical deterioration compared to pre-therapy, which was also recently reported by Institut Gustave Roussy. The current study investigated potential genomic markers associated with ""hyper-progression"" after immunotherapy. Consecutive stage IV cancer patients who received immunotherapies (CTLA-4, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors or other [investigational] agents) and had their tumor evaluated by next-generation sequencing were analyzed (N=155). We defined hyper-progression as time-to-treatment failure (TTF) <2 months, >50% increase in tumor burden compared to pre-immunotherapy imaging, and >2-fold increase in progression pace. Amongst 155 patients, TTF <2 months was seen in all six individuals with MDM2/MDM4 amplification. After anti-PD1/PDL1 monotherapy, four of these patients showed remarkable increases in existing tumor size (55% to 258%), new large masses, and significantly accelerated progression pace (2.3-, 7.1-, 7.2- and 42.3-fold compared to the two months before immunotherapy). In multivariate analysis, MDM2/MDM4 and EGFR alterations correlated with TTF<2 months. Two of 10 patients with EGFR alterations were also hyper-progressors (53.6% and 125% increase in tumor size; 35.7- and 41.7-fold increase). Some patients with MDM2 family amplification or EGFR aberrations had poor clinical outcome and significantly increased rate of tumor growth after single-agent checkpoint (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors. Genomic profiles may help to identify patients at risk for hyper-progression on immunotherapy. Further investigation is urgently needed.",cancer
1686,A flexible transparent Ag-NC@PE film as a cut-and-paste SERS substrate for rapid in situ detection of organic pollutants.,"This report presents a simple and inexpensive fabrication approach to a flexible transparent composite film as a ""cut-and-paste"" surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate for in situ detection of organic pollutants. First, a self-assembled monolayer of Ag-nanocubes (Ag-NCs) is obtained at the air/water interface. Then, the Ag-NC monolayer is retrieved onto a flexible transparent polyethylene (PE) film to achieve an Ag-NC@PE composite film as a flexible SERS substrate. As the Ag-NCs in the monolayer are closely and uniformly packed on the PE film, the Ag-NC@PE composite film shows high SERS-activity with good signal homogeneity and reproducibility. Furthermore, the flexible transparent Ag-NC@PE composite film is ""cut into"" small pieces and directly ""pasted"" onto contaminated fruits for in situ SERS detection, as a result 10 nM thiram, 1 μM 4-polychlorinated biphenyl and 10 nM methyl parathion contaminants on oranges are detected, respectively. Therefore the Ag-NC@PE composite film is an inexpensive and effective SERS substrate for rapid in situ detection of organic pollutants in aqueous solutions, on fruits and other solid objects.",nonCancer
740,The SMAD4 protein and prognosis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"SMAD4 (also called Dpc4) is a tumor suppressor in the TGF-beta signaling pathway that is genetically inactivated in approximately 55% of all pancreatic adenocarcinomas. We investigated whether prognosis after surgical resection for invasive pancreatic adenocarcinoma is influenced by SMAD4 status. Using immunohistochemistry, we characterized the SMAD4 protein status of 249 pancreatic adenocarcinomas resected from patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple resection) at The Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD, between 1990 and 1997. The SMAD4 gene status of 56 of 249 (22%) pancreatic carcinomas was also determined. A multivariate Cox proportional hazards model assessed the relative risk of mortality associated with SMAD4 status, adjusting for known prognostic variables. Patients with pancreatic adenocarcinomas with SMAD4 protein expression had significantly longer survival (unadjusted median survival was 19.2 months as compared with 14.7 months in patients with pancreatic cancers lacking SMAD4 protein expression; P = 0.03). This SMAD4 survival benefit persisted after adjustment for prognostic factors including tumor size, margins, lymph node status, pathological stage, blood loss, and use of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The relative hazard of mortality for cancers lacking SMAD4 after adjusting for other prognostic factors was 1.36 (95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.83; P = 0.04). Patients undergoing Whipple resection for pancreatic adenocarcinoma survive longer if their cancers express SMAD4.",cancer
2519,Impact of longitudinal status change in metabolic syndrome defined by two different criteria on new onset of type 2 diabetes in a general Japanese population: the Tanno-Sobetsu Study.,"We investigated the effect of longitudinal status change in metabolic syndrome (MetS) assessed by two different criteria on new onset of type 2 diabetes (NODM) in a Japanese population.|The participants were 827 non-diabetic citizens who had undergone medical examinations in 1994 and 2003 or 2004. We used two different criteria of MetS: the interim criteria by 6 institutions (MetS-INT) and Japanese criteria (MetS-JP). According to the interim criteria, individuals defined as having MetS have any three of the following five components of MetS: obesity, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL cholesterolemia. According to the Japanese criteria, individuals defined as having MetS must have abdominal obesity plus any two of the following three factors; hyperglycemia, high blood pressure and dyslipidemia (hypertriglyceridemia and/or low HDL-cholesterolemia). According to the status change in MetS, participants were divided into four groups: a non-MetS to non-MetS group, a non-MetS to MetS group, a MetS to non-MetS group and a MetS to MetS group. We calculated odds ratios of these four groups for NODM.|NODM occurred in 65 participants. The odds ratios for NODM were 4.86, 4.97 and 7.50 in the non-MetS-INT to MetS-INT group, MetS-INT to non-MetS-INT group and MetS-INT to MetS-INT group, respectively. On the other hand, the odds ratios were 4.28 and 15.55 in the non-MetS-JP to MetS-JP group and MetS-JP to MetS-JP group, respectively. After adjustment for high fasting plasma glucose at baseline, magnitude of the odds ratio of MetS to MetS group was larger in the Japanese criteria group than in the interim criteria group.|Determining the status of MetS routinely and paying attention to status change in MetS may be important for prevention of type 2 diabetes. MetS defined by the criteria which includes obesity as a prerequisite component may be a stronger risk for type 2 diabetes than MetS defined by the criteria which includes obesity as one of components.",nonCancer
454,"A neoadjuvant, randomized, open-label phase II trial of afatinib versus trastuzumab versus lapatinib in patients with locally advanced HER2-positive breast cancer.","Chemotherapy is standard neoadjuvant treatment of LA BC. Patients with HER2-positive BC require targeted therapy. Trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which target HER2, with chemotherapy are approved as neoadjuvant therapy, however, treatments with different mechanisms of action might provide a broader range of activity. In this study we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the irreversible ErbB family blocker afatinib, versus trastuzumab or lapatinib in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive, LA BC. Treatment-naive, HER2-positive BC patients with stage IIIA, B, C or inflammatory disease were randomized 1:1:1 to daily afatinib (50 mg), lapatinib (1500 mg), or weekly trastuzumab (4 mg/kg loading dose, then 2 mg/kg/wk) for 6 weeks until surgery or follow-up neoadjuvant treatment. The primary end point was objective response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (version 1.0). Recruitment was stopped early because of slow patient enrollment; 29 patients were randomized to afatinib (n = 10), lapatinib (n = 8), or trastuzumab (n = 11). Objective response was seen in 8 afatinib-, 6 lapatinib-, and 4 trastuzumab-treated patients. Eleven patients had stable disease (best response); 1 lapatinib- and 1 trastuzumab-treated patient had progressive disease. All 10 afatinib-treated patients experienced drug-related adverse events (commonly diarrhea, dermatitis acneiform, and paronychia) versus 6 of 8 lapatinib- (diarrhea and rash) and 5 of 11 trastuzumab-treated patients (vomiting and arthralgia). Afatinib demonstrated clinical activity that compared favorably to trastuzumab and lapatinib for neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive BC, with a safety profile consistent with epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors.",cancer
1182,Non-small-cell lung cancer and Ba/F3 transformed cells harboring the ERBB2 G776insV_G/C mutation are sensitive to the dual-specific epidermal growth factor receptor and ERBB2 inhibitor HKI-272.,"Mutation-specific cancer therapy has shown promising clinical efficacy. In non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the presence of mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase correlates with clinical response to small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Here, we show that cells harboring the G776insV_G/C mutation in the related ERBB2 tyrosine kinase (also known as HER2 or Neu), present in a small percentage of NSCLCs, are sensitive to HKI-272, an irreversible dual-specific kinase inhibitor targeting both EGFR and ERBB2. In the ERBB2-mutant NCI-H1781 cell line, HKI-272 treatment inhibited proliferation by induction of G(1) arrest and apoptotic cell death. Furthermore, HKI-272 abrogated autophosphorylation of both ERBB2 and EGFR. Finally, Ba/F3 murine pro-B cells, engineered to express mutant ERBB2, became independent of interleukin-3 and sensitive to HKI-272. Thus, the subset of NSCLC patients with tumors carrying the ERBB2 G776insV_G/C mutation may benefit from treatment with HKI-272.",cancer
321,Mutant HRAS as novel target for MEK and mTOR inhibitors.,"HRAS is a frequently mutated oncogene in cancer. However, mutant HRAS as drug target has not been investigated so far. Here, we show that mutant HRAS hyperactivates the RAS and the mTOR pathway in various cancer cell lines including lung, bladder and esophageal cancer. HRAS mutation sensitized toward growth inhibition by the MEK inhibitors AZD6244, MEK162 and PD0325901. Further, we found that MEK inhibitors induce apoptosis in mutant HRAS cell lines but not in cell lines lacking RAS mutations. In addition, knockdown of HRAS by siRNA blocked cell growth in mutant HRAS cell lines. Inhibition of the PI3K pathway alone or in combination with MEK inhibitors did not alter signaling nor had an impact on viability. However, inhibition of mTOR or combined inhibition of MEK and mTOR reduced cell growth in a synergistic manner. Finally, Ba/F3 cells transformed with mutant HRAS isoforms Q61L, Q61R and G12V demonstrated equal sensitivity towards MEK and mTOR inhibition. Our results show that HRAS mutations in cancer activate the RAS and mTOR pathways which might serve as a therapeutic option for patients with HRAS mutant tumors.",cancer
2069,Mechanism and Origin of Unexpected Chemoselectivity in Fluorocyclization of o-Styryl benzamides with a Hypervalent Fluoroiodane Reagent.,"The mechanism and origin of unexpected chemoselectivity in fluorocyclization of o-styryl benzamide with a cyclic hypervalent fluoroiodane reagent were explored with DFT calculations. The calculations suggested an alternative mechanism that is broadly similar to, but also critically different from the previously proposed mechanism for the formation of unexpected structurally novel seven-membered 4-fluoro-1,3-benzoxazepine. The amide group of o-styryl benzamide was revealed to be crucial to activating the fluoroiodane reagent and facilitating the C-F bond formation. In contrast to popular electrophilic N-F reagent Selectfluor, the F atom in the fluoroiodane reagent is nucleophilic, and the I(III) atom is the most 'electrophilic' site, thus inducing a completely different reactivity pattern. The insights reported here would be valuable for further development of new reactions based on the hypervalent fluoroiodane reagent.",nonCancer

After stem cell collection, 16 patients received topotecan at 1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5 or 6.0 mg/m(2)/d combined with CY 1.5 g/m(2)/d and carboplatin 200 mg/m(2)/d, all by 4-day continuous infusion. Steady state pharmacokinetics of topotecan and carboplatin were examined. Pre-treatment biopsies were examined for the expression of topoisomerase (topo) I, Ki67 and Bcl-2 family members by immunohistochemistry. One of six patients at a topotecan dose of 4.5 mg/m(2)/d and two of three patients at 6.0 mg/m(2)/d had dose-limiting toxicity of grade 3 stomatitis lasting >2 weeks. There was no treatment-related mortality. As topotecan clearance was constant over the dose range examined, topotecan steady state plasma concentrations increased with dose. Median progression-free survival and overall survival were 6.5 months and 2.7 years, respectively. Shorter progression-free survival was observed in tumors with low topo expression (P=0.04). Topotecan can safely be dose escalated to 4.5 mg/m(2)/d in combination with CY, carboplatin and AHSCT. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT00652691.",cancer
743,Inherited Variants in SULT1E1 and Response to Abiraterone Acetate by Men with Metastatic Castration Refractory Prostate Cancer.,"Germline variations in genes involved in androgen biosynthesis and metabolic pathways may predict the response to abiraterone acetate in men with metastatic, castration refractory prostate cancer. The variations may serve as prognostic and predictive biomarkers to allow for more individualized therapy. We evaluated 832 single nucleotide polymorphisms from the OmniExpress genotyping platform (Illumina®) in the boundaries of 61 candidate genes reported to be involved in the androgen metabolic pathway. The purpose was to investigate them for an association with time to treatment failure in 68 white men with metastatic, castration refractory prostate cancer undergoing treatment with abiraterone acetate. Cox proportional hazard analysis was used with Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation as covariates. Each single nucleotide polymorphism was assessed using an allele carriage genetic model in which carriage of 1 or more minor alleles contributes to increased risk. Subset analyses were done to determine whether metastasis site, or prior treatment with ketoconazole or docetaxel would interact with the single nucleotide polymorphisms investigated. Six single nucleotide polymorphisms in the estrogen sulfotransferase gene SULT1E1 were associated with time to treatment failure on abiraterone acetate therapy after false discovery rate (q value) correction for multiple testing while controlling for Gleason score, age, level of alkaline phosphatase and prostate specific antigen at treatment initiation (q <0.05). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in SULT1E1 were significantly associated with time to treatment failure in men on abiraterone acetate therapy. The single nucleotide polymorphisms may serve as predictive markers for treatment with abiraterone acetate.",cancer
149,Expression and mutational status of c-kit in small-cell lung cancer: prognostic relevance.,"The c-kit protein, also known as CD117, is a member of the type III receptor tyrosine kinase family. Kinase activity has been implicated in the pathophysiology of many tumors, including small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). Autocrine or paracrine activation of c-kit by its ligand has been postulated for lung cancer, but this receptor can also be activated by mutations of the c-kit gene. We examined c-kit expression and mutational status in SCLC to verify its putative expression and genetic alterations, as well as its eventual prognostic impact. We studied 60 SCLC samples to determine the mutations of the coding region of the gene; the exons 9 and 11 were analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and automated sequencing. Moreover, c-kit expression was evaluated in 55 samples by immunohistochemical method. Expression of c-kit was demonstrated in about 40% of SCLC samples. Two mutations in exon 9 and three mutations in exon 11 were found. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed no prognostic significance of c-kit expression for survival. In our series, the expression of c-kit and its mutational status failed to appear relevant or to have a significant impact on survival; this makes the therapeutic approach with an inhibitor of tyrosine kinase more difficult in SCLC until a sure demonstration of c-kit implication is obtained for this tumor.",cancer
1950,Septic shoulder presenting as a shoulder dislocation in the pediatric patient: a case report.,"Shoulder dislocation is relatively uncommon in the younger pediatric population. Because of the relative strength of the surrounding soft tissue structures of the shoulder compared with the proximal humeral physis, subluxation or dislocation resulting from a traumatic event or application of force is rare and instead a proximal humeral physeal injury occurs. Case presentation - We present a 5-year-old male who presented to the office with post-traumatic left shoulder pain for about 1 week. Radiographs of the left shoulder indicated inferior subluxation of the humeral head. He was ultimately diagnosed and treated for a septic shoulder. Septic arthritis of the glenohumeral joint accounts for about 3% of all septic arthritis cases. About half of the pediatric patients with a septic arthritis will present with a concomitant osteomyelitis about the joint involved. Widening of the glenohumeral joint and subluxation clinically as well as radiographically have been described in cases of large joint effusions because of an increase in intra-articular fluid in adults. This inferior subluxation is often noted without a frank dislocation. The case described in this report is unique in that this is the first to describe a pediatric septic shoulder presenting as a shoulder subluxation. Given the rarity of pediatric shoulder dislocations and subluxations, the pediatric orthopaedist and pediatrician should maintain a suspicion for a septic joint.|Level V.",nonCancer
2349,Management of pain in chronic pancreatitis with emphasis on exogenous pancreatic enzymes.,"One of the most challenging issues arising in patients with chronic pancreatitis is the management of abdominal pain. Many competing theories exist to explain pancreatic pain including ductal hypertension from strictures and stones, increased interstitial pressure from glandular fibrosis, pancreatic neuritis, and ischemia. This clinical problem is superimposed on a background of reduced enzyme secretion and altered feedback mechanisms. Throughout history, investigators have used these theories to devise methods to combat chronic pancreatic pain including: Lifestyle measures, antioxidants, analgesics, administration of exogenous pancreatic enzymes, endoscopic drainage procedures, and surgical drainage and resection procedures. While the value of each modality has been debated over the years, pancreatic enzyme therapy remains a viable option. Enzyme therapy restores active enzymes to the small bowel and targets the altered feedback mechanism that lead to increased pancreatic ductal and tissue pressures, ischemia, and pain. Here, we review the mechanisms and treatments for chronic pancreatic pain with a specific focus on pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy. We also discuss different approaches to overcoming a lack of clinical response update ideas for studies needed to improve the clinical use of pancreatic enzymes to ameliorate pancreatic pain.",nonCancer
1247,When is prophylactic thyroidectomy indicated for patients with the RET codon 609 mutation?,"Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene cause multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN2A), and prophylactic thyroidectomy has generally been recommended before the age of 5 years. Patients with codon 609 mutations develop MTC at a later age and therefore the timing of prophylactic thyroidectomy is less clear. We report a three-generation family with C609Y RET mutation where members having prophylactic or therapeutic thyroidectomy call the current recommendations for age at thyroidectomy into question. Sixteen family members underwent thyroidectomy, for which clinical, laboratory, and pathological data were analyzed. A literature review of RET codon 609 mutations was carried out. Data were collected from 16 patients from this 38-member kindred. None of these affected members had pheochromocytoma, and one had a parathyroid adenoma. Nine of 16 patients had MTC (mean age 44.7 years, range 29-59 years) and elevated basal calcitonin levels; 6 of these 9 had lymph node metastases. Two patients had C-cell hyperplasia (CCH) at ages 18 and 37 years, and five patients had normal thyroid pathology (mean age 16 years, range 5-37 years). In the literature, a family with C609Y mutation was reported, with 15 members having MTC (mean age 42 years, range 21-59 years), and 6 with CCH (mean age 24 years, range 15-37 years). The youngest patient with C609Y RET mutation and MTC was 21 years old, and the youngest patient with CCH was 15 years old at diagnosis. These data suggest that patients with RET C609Y mutations can delay thyroidectomy until 10-15 years of age, with annual calcitonin screening prior to thyroidectomy.",cancer
2310,Effects of social isolation and re-socialization on cognition and ADAR1 (p110) expression in mice.,"It has been reported that social isolation stress could be a key factor that leads to cognitive deficit for both humans and rodent models. However, detailed mechanisms are not yet clear. ADAR1 (Adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) is an enzyme involved in RNA editing that has a close relation to cognitive function. We have hypothesized that social isolation stress may impact the expression of ADAR1 in the brain of mice with cognitive deficit. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the cognition ability of mice isolated for different durations (2, 4, and 8 weeks) using object recognition and object location tests; we also measured ADAR1 expression in hippocampus and cortex using immunohistochemistry and western blot. Our study showed that social isolation stress induced spatial and non-spatial cognition deficits of the tested mice. In addition, social isolation significantly increased both the immunoreactivity and protein expression of ADAR1 (p110) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex. Furthermore, re-socialization could not only recover the cognition deficits, but also bring ADAR1 (p110) immunoreactivity of hippocampus and frontal cortex, as well as ADAR1 (p110) protein expression of hippocampus back to the normal level for the isolated mice in adolescence. In conclusion, social isolation stress significantly increases ADAR1 (p110) expression in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of the mice with cognitive deficit. This finding may open a window to better understand the reasons (e.g., epigenetic change) that are responsible for social isolation-induced cognitive deficit and help the development of novel therapies for the resulted diseases.",nonCancer
1621,Metabolic syndrome and subsequent risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in elderly women: Challenging the current definition.,"The prognostic value of the metabolic syndrome (MetS) is believed to vary with age. With an elderly population expecting to triple by 2060, it is important to evaluate the validity of MetS in this age group. We examined the association of MetS risk factors with later risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) in elderly Caucasian women. We further investigated if stratification of individuals not defined with MetS would add predictive power in defining future disease prevalence of individuals with MetS.The Prospective Epidemiological Risk Factor Study, a community-based cohort study, followed 3905 Danish women since 2000 (age: 70.1 ± 6.5) with no previous diagnosis of T2DM or CVD, holding all measurements used for MetS definition; central obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia combined with register-based follow-up information.Elderly women with defined MetS presented a 6.3-fold increased risk of T2DM (95% confidence interval: [3.74-10.50]) and 1.7-fold increased risk of CVD (1.44-2.05) compared to women with no MetS risk factors. Subdividing the control group without defined MetS revealed that both centrally obese controls and controls holding other MetS risk factors also had increased risk of T2DM (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.21 [1.25-3.93] and HR = 1.75 [1.04-2.96]) and CVD (HR = 1.51 [1.25-1.83] and HR = 1.36 [1.15-1.60]) when compared to controls with no MetS risk factors.MetS in elderly Caucasian women increased risk of future T2DM and CVD. While not defined with MetS, women holding only some risk factors for MetS were also at increased risk of T2DM or CVD compared to women with no MetS risk factors.",nonCancer
1449,Computational Study of Aqueous Humor Dynamics Assessing the Vault and the Pupil Diameter in Two Posterior-Chamber Phakic Lenses.,"To compare the behavior of aqueous humor (AH) and analyze flow differences by comparing the volume and velocity of the flow after two different models of implantable collamer lens (ICL) placement.|Computational fluid dynamics with numerical simulation using Ansys Fluent software was performed to compare the AH flow through a peripheral iridotomy (PI), which is typically performed after implantation of a V4b lens to the central hole of a V4c lens. The volume and flow rate in 24 scenarios were compared according to the type of lens, pupil diameter (PD) (3.5 or 5.5 mm), the vault (100, 350, and 800 μm) and the PI (single or double, 180 or 360 μm).|With a standard vault (350 μm) and a PD of 3.5 mm, the volume of AH that flows from the posterior to the anterior chamber through the PI (V4b lens: 73.4% in 360 μm and 17.3% in 180 μm) and for the central hole (V4c lens: 75.7%) is larger than in the case of a PD of 5.5 mm (13.9%, 0.91%, and 15.3% respectively). When the vault is low (100; PD 3.5 mm), the volume of AH that reaches the central hole of the V4c lens is diminished (52.0%), being 5.1% if the pupil is enlarged.|AH flow varies depending on the type of ICL implanted, whether it is implanted with an iridotomy or a central hole on the lens, the PD, and the vault.",nonCancer
32,"Imatinib for melanomas harboring mutationally activated or amplified KIT arising on mucosal, acral, and chronically sun-damaged skin.","Amplifications and mutations in the KIT proto-oncogene in subsets of melanomas provide therapeutic opportunities. We conducted a multicenter phase II trial of imatinib in metastatic mucosal, acral, or chronically sun-damaged (CSD) melanoma with KIT amplifications and/or mutations. Patients received imatinib 400 mg once per day or 400 mg twice per day if there was no initial response. Dose reductions were permitted for treatment-related toxicities. Additional oncogene mutation screening was performed by mass spectroscopy. Twenty-five patients were enrolled (24 evaluable). Eight patients (33%) had tumors with KIT mutations, 11 (46%) with KIT amplifications, and five (21%) with both. Median follow-up was 10.6 months (range, 3.7 to 27.1 months). Best overall response rate (BORR) was 29% (21% excluding nonconfirmed responses) with a two-stage 95% CI of 13% to 51%. BORR was significantly greater than the hypothesized null of 5% and statistically significantly different by mutation status (7 of 13 or 54% KIT mutated v 0% KIT amplified only). There were no statistical differences in rates of progression or survival by mutation status or by melanoma site. The overall disease control rate was 50% but varied significantly by KIT mutation status (77% mutated v 18% amplified). Four patients harbored pretreatment NRAS mutations, and one patient acquired increased KIT amplification after treatment. Melanomas that arise on mucosal, acral, or CSD skin should be assessed for KIT mutations. Imatinib can be effective when tumors harbor KIT mutations, but not if KIT is amplified only. NRAS mutations and KIT copy number gain may be mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to imatinib.",cancer
1189,Implications and prognostic value of K-ras mutation for early-stage lung cancer in women.,"Because there is no clear consensus as to the predictive value of K-ras gene mutation for survival in patients with lung cancer, we examined the occurrence of K-ras mutations in a large, prospective case series of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our goals were to define the patient characteristics associated with K-ras mutation and to determine whether mutation of this gene might be a biomarker of patient prognosis. Consecutive, newly diagnosed patients with lung cancer treated with potentially curative resection over a 4-year period were recruited for study. The mutation status of K-ras codon 12 in each patient's tumor DNA was determined by means of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of archived pathology specimens. Analyses were restricted to adenocarcinoma. There was a statistically significant association between female sex and K-ras mutation after adjustment for carcinogen exposures (odds ratio = 3.3; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.3-7.9); mutations were found only in smokers. Comparison of Kaplan-Meier curves indicated a strong association between K-ras mutation and decreased patient survival (two-sided P =.009); analysis stratified by pathologic staging groups revealed that this association was statistically significant only for stage I tumors (two-sided P =.002). Cox proportional hazards modeling indicated that K-ras codon 12 mutation was a statistically significant predictor of patient survival, after adjustment for the effects of age, sex, and stage (risk ratio = 1.8; 95% CI = 1.1-3.1). After adjustment for environmental exposures, non-small-cell lung tumors in women appear to be more likely than those in men to harbor K-ras mutations, suggesting a possible role of estrogen exposure in either the initiation or the selection of K-ras mutant clones in adenocarcinoma. In addition, our data suggest that K-ras codon 12 mutation is a marker of aggressive NSCLC, as evidenced by its association with decreased patient survival, particularly for early-stage disease.",cancer
983,Afatinib Activity in Platinum-Refractory Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma in Patients With ERBB Alterations.,"Somatic mutations and copy number variation in the ERBB family are frequent in urothelial carcinoma (UC) and may represent viable therapeutic targets. We studied whether afatinib (an oral, irreversible inhibitor of the ErbB family) has activity in UC and if specific ERBB molecular alterations are associated with clinical response. In this phase II trial, patients with metastatic platinum-refractory UC received afatinib 40 mg/day continuously until progression or intolerance. The primary end point was 3-month progression-free survival (PFS3). Prespecified tumor analysis for alterations in EGFR, HER2, ERBB3, and ERBB4 was conducted. The first-stage enrollment goal of 23 patients was met. Patient demographic data included: 78% male, median age 67 years (range, 36 to 82 years), hemoglobin < 10 g/dL in 17%, liver metastases in 30%, median time from prior chemotherapy of 3.6 months, and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≤ 1 in 100%. No unexpected toxicities were observed; two patients required dose reduction for grade 3 fatigue and rash. Overall, five of 23 patients (21.7%) met PFS3 (two partial response, three stable disease). Notably, among the 21 tumors analyzed, five of six patients (83.3%) with HER2 and/or ERBB3 alterations achieved PFS3 (PFS = 10.3, 7.0, 6.9, 6.3, and 5.0 months, respectively) versus none of 15 patients without alterations (P < .001). Three of four patients with HER2 amplification and three of three patients with ERBB3 somatic mutations (G284R, V104M, and R103G) met PFS3. One patient with both HER2 amplification and ERBB3 mutation never progressed on therapy, but treatment was discontinued after 10.3 months as a result of depressed ejection fraction. The median time to progression/discontinuation was 6.6 months in patients with HER2/ERBB3 alterations versus 1.4 months in patients without alterations (P < .001). Afatinib demonstrated significant activity in patients with platinum-refractory UC with HER2 or ERBB3 alterations. The potential contribution of ERBB3 to afatinib sensitivity is novel. Afatinib deserves further investigation in molecularly selected UC.",cancer

MUAC is a simple screening tool that has been shown to be a better predictor of mortality in acutely malnourished children than other practicable anthropometric indicators. This study compared, under program conditions, mothers and CHWs in screening for severe acute malnutrition (SAM) by color-banded MUAC tapes.|This pragmatic interventional, non-randomized efficacy study took place in two health zones of Niger's Mirriah District from May 2013 to April 2014. Mothers in Dogo (Mothers Zone) and CHWs in Takieta (CHWs Zone) were trained to screen for malnutrition by MUAC color-coded class and check for edema. Exhaustive coverage surveys were conducted quarterly, and relevant data collected routinely in the health and nutrition program. An efficacy and cost analysis of each screening strategy was performed.|A total of 12,893 mothers and caretakers were trained in the Mothers Zone and 36 CHWs in the CHWs Zone, and point coverage was similar in both zones at the end of the study (35.14 % Mothers Zone vs 32.35 % CHWs Zone, p = 0.9484). In the Mothers Zone, there was a higher rate of MUAC agreement (75.4 % vs 40.1 %, p <0.0001) and earlier detection of cases, with median MUAC at admission for those enrolled by MUAC <115 mm estimated to be 1.6 mm higher using a smoothed bootstrap procedure. Children in the Mothers Zone were much less likely to require inpatient care, both at admission and during treatment, with the most pronounced difference at admission for those enrolled by MUAC < 115 mm (risk ratio = 0.09 [95 % CI 0.03; 0.25], p < 0.0001). Training mothers required higher up-front costs, but overall costs for the year were much lower ($8,600 USD vs $21,980 USD.).|Mothers were not inferior to CHWs in screening for malnutrition at a substantially lower cost. Children in the Mothers Zone were admitted at an earlier stage of SAM and required fewer hospitalizations. Making mothers the focal point of screening strategies should be included in malnutrition treatment programs.|The trial is registered with clinicaltrials.gov (Trial number NCT01863394).",nonCancer
240,FISH analysis of 107 prostate cancers shows that PTEN genomic deletion is associated with poor clinical outcome.,"This study examines the clinical impact of PTEN genomic deletions using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) analysis of 107 prostate cancers, with follow-up information covering a period of up to 10 years. Tissue microarray analysis using interphase FISH indicated that hemizygous PTEN losses were present in 42/107 (39%) of prostatic adenocarcinomas, with a homozygous PTEN deletion observed in 5/107 (5%) tumours. FISH analysis using closely linked probes centromeric and telomeric to the PTEN indicated that subband microdeletions accounted for approximately 70% genomic losses. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of PTEN genomic losses (hemizygous and homozygous deletion vs not deleted) identified subgroups with different prognosis based on their time to biochemical relapse after surgery, and demonstrated significant association between PTEN deletion and an earlier onset of disease recurrence (as determined by prostate-specific antigen levels). Homozygous PTEN deletion was associated with a much earlier onset of biochemical recurrence (P=0.002). Furthermore, PTEN loss at the time of prostatectomy correlated with clinical parameters of more advanced disease, such as extraprostatic extension and seminal vesicle invasion. Collectively, our data indicates that haploinsufficiency or PTEN genomic loss is an indicator of more advanced disease at surgery, and is predictive of a shorter time to biochemical recurrence of disease.",cancer
2522,Exploring complex cellular phenotypes and model-guided strain design with a novel genome-scale metabolic model of Clostridium thermocellum DSM 1313 implementing an adjustable cellulosome.,"Clostridium thermocellum is a gram-positive thermophile that can directly convert lignocellulosic material into biofuels. The metabolism of C. thermocellum contains many branches and redundancies which limit biofuel production, and typical genetic techniques are time-consuming. Further, the genome sequence of a genetically tractable strain C. thermocellum DSM 1313 has been recently sequenced and annotated. Therefore, developing a comprehensive, predictive, genome-scale metabolic model of DSM 1313 is desired for elucidating its complex phenotypes and facilitating model-guided metabolic engineering.|We constructed a genome-scale metabolic model iAT601 for DSM 1313 using the KEGG database as a scaffold and an extensive literature review and bioinformatic analysis for model refinement. Next, we used several sets of experimental data to train the model, e.g., estimation of the ATP requirement for growth-associated maintenance (13.5 mmol ATP/g DCW/h) and cellulosome synthesis (57 mmol ATP/g cellulosome/h). Using our tuned model, we investigated the effect of cellodextrin lengths on cell yields, and could predict in silico experimentally observed differences in cell yield based on which cellodextrin species is assimilated. We further employed our tuned model to analyze the experimentally observed differences in fermentation profiles (i.e., the ethanol to acetate ratio) between cellobiose- and cellulose-grown cultures and infer regulatory mechanisms to explain the phenotypic differences. Finally, we used the model to design over 250 genetic modification strategies with the potential to optimize ethanol production, 6155 for hydrogen production, and 28 for isobutanol production.|Our developed genome-scale model iAT601 is capable of accurately predicting complex cellular phenotypes under a variety of conditions and serves as a high-quality platform for model-guided strain design and metabolic engineering to produce industrial biofuels and chemicals of interest.",nonCancer
2475,"Epigenetic modification suppresses proliferation, migration and invasion of urothelial cancer cell lines.","Epigenetic approaches offer additional therapeutic options, including apoptosis induction, modification of cell cycle regulating proteins and the re-expression of pharmaceutical targets, such as hormone receptors. The present study analyzed the effect of the epigenetic modifiers 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine and Trichostatin A on the proliferative, migratory and invasive behavior of four urinary bladder cancer cell lines (RT-4, RT-112, VMCUB-1 and T-24), and the expression of various matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs). Cell proliferation, migration and invasion assays revealed that treatment with the two epigenetic modifiers resulted in proliferation inhibition in all cell lines, and migration and invasion inhibition in RT-4, RT-112 and T-24 cell lines. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction demonstrated that the mRNA expression of a broad selection of MMPs and their TIMPs was induced in all cell lines, and MMP-14 mRNA expression was suppressed in all cell lines, with the exception of RT-4. In conclusion, epigenetic modifications suppressed the motility and invasiveness of three out of four urothelial cancer cell lines. The inhibitory effect on cell motility appears to be crucial for reduced invasive properties. However, even a broad spectrum of mRNA analysis does not sufficiently explain the loss of invasiveness, as it does not allow for functional conclusions. Further complex urothelial tumour models should be applied to investigate whether epigenetic therapeutic approaches may be an option in urothelial cancer.",nonCancer

471,Thymidylate synthase and dihydrofolate reductase expression in non-small cell lung carcinoma: the association with treatment efficacy of pemetrexed.,"Thymidylate synthase (TS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) are target enzymes of inhibition by pemetrexed, an antifolate for treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study is to evaluate the association of TS and DHFR expressions and the treatment efficacy of pemetrexed in NSCLC patients. From January 2006 to October 2008, patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pemetrexed after prior chemotherapy were included. The TS and DHFR expressions in tumor tissues were examined by immunohistochemistry and evaluated by a semiquantitative histologic score (H-score). The H-score was derived from the degrees of intensity of tumor cells multiplied by the percentage of positive neoplastic cells. The medical records were reviewed and analyzed with respect to patients' characteristics, histology types, treatment responses and survivals. Among 268 NSCLC patients treated with pemetrexed, 49 had tumor specimens available for TS and DHFR evaluation. The TS expression was positively correlated with DHFR expression (r(2)=0.11, p=0.02). Patients with low TS (≤150) expression had a longer median progression-free survival (PFS) than those with high TS (>150) expression (4.8 vs. 3.4 months; p=0.01). Patients with low DHFR expression (≤120) also had a longer median PFS than patients with high DHFR expression (>120), which was not statistically significant (5.8 vs. 3.6 months; p=0.33). In patients with adenocarcinoma, the low TS patient group also had a longer median PFS and a longer median overall survival (OS) as compared with patients with high TS expression (PFS, 4.8 vs. 3.8 months, p=0.03; OS, 21.4 vs. 10.0 months, p=0.03). Nevertheless, the association of DHFR expression level and median PFS as well as OS were not statistically significant. TS expression, rather than DHFR, may be an important predictive factor for treatment efficacy of pemetrexed in NSCLC patients.",cancer

ABCB1 gene polymorphisms may alter the expression and function of Pgp, thereby influencing the response to chemotherapy. A panel of 17 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines was used to investigate whether alterations in the ABCB1 gene or its mRNA expression correlated with in vitro chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. Polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene were evaluated by direct sequencing. mRNA expression levels were assessed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR. In vitro chemosensitivity to paclitaxel was expressed as half-maximal inhibitory concentration values, using a tetrazolium (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide)-based colorimetric assay. The variant allele frequencies for four ABCB1 gene polymorphisms were 14.71% for 2677G>T/A, 32.35% for 2734T>C, 23.53% for 3396C>T and 76.47% for 3435C>T. There was a significant positive correlation between ABCB1 mRNA expression and half-maximal inhibitory concentration values for paclitaxel (r=0.5322, P=0.0279). None of the four ABCB1 gene polymorphisms were associated with paclitaxel chemosensitivity or ABCB1 mRNA expression in the 17 cell lines. These in vitro results suggest that high ABCB1 mRNA expression may be a predictive biomarker for poor chemosensitivity to paclitaxel. The panel of NSCLC cell lines may provide clues and indications for establishing clinically useful relationships between a given polymorphism or level of gene expression and chemosensitivity to an anti-cancer agent.",cancer
1517,"Destabilization of the metal site as a hub for the pathogenic mechanism of five ALS-linked mutants of copper, zinc superoxide dismutase.","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a lethal neurodegenerative disease, with no effective pharmacological treatment. Its pathogenesis is unknown, although a subset of the cases is linked to genetic mutations. A significant fraction of the mutations occur in one protein, copper, zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1). The toxic function of mutant SOD1 has not been elucidated, but damage to the metal site of the protein is believed to play a major role. In this work, we study the electrostatic loop of SOD1, which we had previously proposed to work as a ""solvent seal"" isolating the metal site from water molecules. Out of the five contact points identified between the electrostatic loop and its dock in the rest of the protein, three points were found to be affected by ALS-linked mutations, with a total of five mutations identified. The effect of the five mutations was studied using methods of computational chemistry. We found that four of the mutations destabilize the proposed solvent seal, while the fifth mutation directly affects the metal-site stability. In the two contact points unaffected by ALS-linked mutations, the side chains of the residues were not found to play a stabilizing role. Our results show that the docking of the electrostatic loop to the rest of SOD1 plays a role in ALS pathogenesis, in support of that structure acting as a solvent barrier for the metal site. The results provide a unified pathogenic mechanism for five different ALS-linked mutations of SOD1.",nonCancer
2502,Activation of AMPK attenuates LPS-induced acute lung injury by upregulation of PGC1α and SOD1.,"Evidence suggests that an imbalance between oxidation and antioxidation is involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) has been shown to inhibit the occurrence of ALI/ARDS. However, it is unknown whether activation of AMPK benefits ALI/ARDS by restoration of the oxidant and antioxidant balance, and which mechanisms are responsible for this process. The present study aimed to address these issues. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced pronounced pathological changes of ALI in mice; these were accompanied by elevated production of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) compared with control mice. Prior treatment of mice with the AMPK agonist metformin significantly suppressed the LPS-induced development of ALI, reduced the elevation of MDA and increased the activity of SOD. Further analysis indicated that activation of AMPK also stimulated the protein expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator 1α (PGC1α) and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1). This study suggests that activation of AMPK by metformin inhibits oxidative stress by upregulation of PGC1α and SOD1, thereby suppressing the development of ALI/ARDS, and has potential value in the clinical treatment of such conditions.",nonCancer
1942,Significant Individual Variation Between Pathologists in the Evaluation of Colon Cancer Specimens After Complete Mesocolic Excision.,"After the introduction of complete mesocolic excision, a new pathological evaluation of the resected colon cancer specimen was introduced.

The grading of colon cancer specimens is likely to depend on both surgical quality and the training of the pathologist.|The purpose of this study was to validate the principles of the pathological evaluation of colon cancer specimens.|This was an exploratory study.|The study was conducted in Aarhus, Denmark, and Leeds, United Kingdom.|Colon cancers specimens were used.|The agreement of gradings between participants was of interest. Four specialist GI pathologists and 2 abdominal surgeons evaluated 2 rounds of colon cancer specimens, each at 2 separate time points. Each round contained 50 specimens. After the first round, a protocol of detailed principles for the grading procedure was agreed on. Results from an experienced pathologist were considered as the reference results.|In the first round, the distribution of gradings between participants showed substantial variation. In the second round, the variation was reduced. Intraobserver agreement was mostly fair to good, whereas interobserver agreement was frequently poor. This did not significantly change from round 1 to round 2.|The small sample size of 100 specimens provided a very small number of specimens resected in the muscularis propria plane, which renders the evaluation of this group potentially unreliable. The evaluations were made on photos and not on fresh specimens.|This study demonstrates significant variation in the pathological evaluation of colon cancer specimens.

1212,Distinctive activation patterns in constitutively active and gefitinib-sensitive EGFR mutants.,"Mutations in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are associated with clinical responsiveness to gefitinib in patients with non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLC). Recently, we have identified many novel EGFR mutations in NSCLC tissues. In this study, we found that gefitinib could suppress the tyrosine phosphorylation of most EGFR mutants better than the wild-type receptor. However, gefitinib had quite variable growth-suppressive effects on different EGFR mutant-expressing cells. All tested EGFR mutants have high basal phosphorylation at multiple tyrosine residues. Upon EGF stimulation, the mutated EGFRs did not have apparently stronger phosphorylation at tyrosines 845, 992, 1,068, and 1,173 than the wild-type receptor. However, stronger phosphorylation at tyrosine 1,045 was observed in the S768I, L861Q, E709G, and G719S mutants. The E746-A750 deletion mutant was less responsive to EGF than the wild-type and other mutant receptors. The S768I, L861Q, E709G, and G719S mutants were refractory to EGF-induced ubiquitination and had more sustained tyrosine phosphorylation. E709G and G719S also lacked EGF-induced receptor downregulation. Our results indicate that, in addition to sensitivity to gefitinib, EGFR mutations also caused various changes in EGFR's regulatory mechanisms, which may contribute to the constitutive activation of EGFR mutants and oncogenesis in NSCLC.",cancer
2432,Effective hepatic artery chemoembolization for advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with multiple tumor thrombi and pulmonary metastases: A case report.,"Advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with tumor thrombi invading the portal vein and extending into the right atrium (RA) through the hepatic vein is regarded as a terminal-stage condition. Intracardiac tumor thrombus and treatment via liver resection has been reported in the current literature, but results from this therapeutic approach remain unsatisfactory. The present study describes a rare case of HCC with metastatic portal vein, middle hepatic vein, inferior vena cava (IVC) and RA tumor thrombi, and pulmonary metastases. A 29-year-old woman was admitted to The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Traditional Chinese Medical University (Nanning, China) subsequent to experiencing right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Following diagnosis, based on computed tomography analysis and laboratory data, the patient underwent an initial transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) treatment using fluorouracil (5-FU), pirarubicin, mitomycin C, Lipiodol and sodium alginate microball (KMG). At 1 month post-treatment, serum α-fetoprotein levels remained at >1,000 ng/ml. Subsequently, the patient underwent a second TACE treatment. At 1 month after the second treatment, the abdominal pain had been alleviated and the serum α-fetoprotein levels were reduced to <20 ng/ml. Imaging analysis indicated a marked reduction in tumor burden in the liver and the hepatic vein and IVC tumor thrombi. Furthermore, the portal vein and RA tumor thrombi, and the pulmonary metastases had disappeared. At 40 months after the second TACE therapy, the patient remains alive without any signs of recurrence. The present case demonstrates that the administration of TACE, using 5-FU, pirarubicin, mitomycin C, Lipiodol and KMG, functions as an effective treatment in cases of unresectable advanced HCC presenting with pulmonary metastases and extensive tumor thrombi in the IVC, the RA and one branch of the portal vein.",nonCancer

The present study performed a retrospective analysis to examine the clinical characteristics and outcome of surgically resected patients with lung cancer plus CPFE. Among 831 patients with primary lung cancer who underwent surgical resection, 23 patients (2.8%) were diagnosed with CPFE and 9 patients (1.1%) with solely idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Thirty-five patients were stratified as the solely emphysema group with adjustment of the pathological stage. The clinicopathological characteristics of patients in the CPFE group and their outcomes were evaluated and compared with those with the solely IPF or solely emphysema groups. Within the CPFE group, no significant differences in survival between patients with post-operative acute exacerbation (AE; n=3) and those without AE (n=20) were noted; however, in the solely IPF group, patients with post-operative AE (n=4) had a significantly shorter survival than those without AE (n=5; P=0.022). The 5-year survival rate of patients in the CPFE, solely IPF and solely emphysema groups was 22, 22 and 58%, respectively. Furthermore, the CPFE and solely IPF groups showed a significantly shorter survival than the solely emphysema group (P=0.001 and 0.011, respectively). In conclusion, surgically resected lung cancer patients with CPFE had poor survival, which was, in contrast to that of lung cancer patients with solely IPF, not affected by AE.",nonCancer
1183,"Antitumor activity of HM781-36B, a highly effective pan-HER inhibitor in erlotinib-resistant NSCLC and other EGFR-dependent cancer models.","The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) family of receptor tyrosine kinases has been implicated in a variety of cancers. In particular, activating mutations such as the L858R point mutation in exon 21 and the small in-frame deletions in exon 19 of the EGFR tyrosine kinase domain are correlated with sensitivity to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Clinical treatment of patients is limited by the development of drug resistance resulting mainly from a gatekeeper mutation (T790M). In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of a novel, irreversible pan-HER inhibitor, HM781-36B. The results from this study show that HM781-36B is a potent inhibitor of EGFR in vitro, including the EGFR-acquired resistance mutation (T790M), as well as HER-2 and HER-4, compared with other EGFR tyrosine kinases inhibitors (erlotinib, lapatinib and BIBW2992). HM781-36B treatment of EGFR DelE746_A750-harboring erlotinib-sensitive HCC827 and EGFR L858R/T790M-harboring erlotinib-resistant NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells results in the inhibition of EGFR phosphorylation and the subsequent deactivation of downstream signaling proteins. Additionally, HM781-36B shows an excellent efficacy in a variety of EGFR- and HER-2-dependent tumor xenograft models, including erlotinib-sensitive HCC827 NSCLC cells, erlotinib-resistant NCI-H1975 NSCLC cells, HER-2 overexpressing Calu-3 NSCLC cells, NCI-N87 gastric cancer cells, SK-Ov3 ovarian cancer cells and EGFR-overexpressing A431 epidermoid carcinoma cancer cells. On the basis of these preclinical results, HM781-36B is the most potent pan-HER inhibitor, which will be advantageous for the treatment of patients with NSCLC including clinical limitation caused by acquired mutation (EGFR T790M), breast cancer and gastric cancer.",cancer
2142,Implementation of Intranasal Midazolam for Prolonged Seizures in a Child Neurology Practice.,"Currently, evidence supports the use of intranasal midazolam as an effective, and in many cases, preferable treatment option for prolonged seizures in children. Despite this knowledge, intranasal midazolam is not routinely found as a standard of care. The goal of this project was to implement the use of intranasal midazolam as a rescue medication for prolonged seizures within a child neurology practice and, in doing so, create a model for implementation that would be replicable for other practice sites. This project focused on the development of a process to make intranasal midazolam available as a treatment option and then the creation of an educational intervention for providers within a child neurology practice. Provider surveys analyzed provider attitudes toward intranasal midazolam and its frequency of use. Because of this project, a dramatic increase in the prescribing of intranasal midazolam was observed within a child neurology practice.",nonCancer
687,Effect of KRAS oncogene substitutions on protein behavior: implications for signaling and clinical outcome.,"Mutations in the v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) play a critical role in cancer cell growth and resistance to therapy. Most mutations occur at codons 12 and 13. In colorectal cancer, the presence of any mutant KRas amino acid substitution is a negative predictor of patient response to targeted therapy. However, in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the evidence that KRAS mutation is a predictive factor is conflicting. We used data from a molecularly targeted clinical trial for 215 patients with tissues available out of 268 evaluable patients with refractory NSCLC to examine associations between specific mutant KRas proteins and progression-free survival and tumor gene expression. Transcriptome microarray studies of patient tumor samples and reverse-phase protein array studies of a panel of 67 NSCLC cell lines with known substitutions in KRas and in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells stably expressing different mutant KRas proteins were used to investigate signaling pathway activation. Molecular modeling was used to study the conformations of wild-type and mutant KRas proteins. Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox regression were used to analyze survival data. All statistical tests were two-sided. Patients whose tumors had either mutant KRas-Gly12Cys or mutant KRas-Gly12Val had worse progression-free survival compared with patients whose tumors had other mutant KRas proteins or wild-type KRas (P = .046, median survival = 1.84 months) compared with all other mutant KRas (median survival = 3.35 months) or wild-type KRas (median survival = 1.95 months). NSCLC cell lines with mutant KRas-Gly12Asp had activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI-3-K) and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) signaling, whereas those with mutant KRas-Gly12Cys or mutant KRas-Gly12Val had activated Ral signaling and decreased growth factor-dependent Akt activation. Molecular modeling studies showed that different conformations imposed by mutant KRas may lead to altered association with downstream signaling transducers. Not all mutant KRas proteins affect patient survival or downstream signaling in a similar way. The heterogeneous behavior of mutant KRas proteins implies that therapeutic interventions may need to take into account the specific mutant KRas expressed by the tumor.",cancer

They are simply synthesised by the reaction of organic methylcarbonate salts with P(SiMe3)3. The products are obtained in near to quantitative yields and they are highly viscous liquids at room temperature or have low melting points for symmetric cations. Moreover, extending this synthetic strategy towards Sb(SiMe3)3 we discovered a simple synthesis for [P(nBu)3Me](+)3[Sb11](3-), the first organic cation salt comprising the Zintl-anion [Sb11](3-).",nonCancer
712,PF-06463922 is a potent and selective next-generation ROS1/ALK inhibitor capable of blocking crizotinib-resistant ROS1 mutations.,"Oncogenic c-ros oncogene1 (ROS1) fusion kinases have been identified in a variety of human cancers and are attractive targets for cancer therapy. The MET/ALK/ROS1 inhibitor crizotinib (Xalkori, PF-02341066) has demonstrated promising clinical activity in ROS1 fusion-positive non-small cell lung cancer. However, emerging clinical evidence has shown that patients can develop resistance by acquiring secondary point mutations in ROS1 kinase. In this study we characterized the ROS1 activity of PF-06463922, a novel, orally available, CNS-penetrant, ATP-competitive small-molecule inhibitor of ALK/ROS1. In vitro, PF-06463922 exhibited subnanomolar cellular potency against oncogenic ROS1 fusions and inhibited the crizotinib-refractory ROS1(G2032R) mutation and the ROS1(G2026M) gatekeeper mutation. Compared with crizotinib and the second-generation ALK/ROS1 inhibitors ceritinib and alectinib, PF-06463922 showed significantly improved inhibitory activity against ROS1 kinase. A crystal structure of the PF-06463922-ROS1 kinase complex revealed favorable interactions contributing to the high-affinity binding. In vivo, PF-06463922 showed marked antitumor activity in tumor models expressing FIG-ROS1, CD74-ROS1, and the CD74-ROS1(G2032R) mutation. Furthermore, PF-06463922 demonstrated antitumor activity in a genetically engineered mouse model of FIG-ROS1 glioblastoma. Taken together, our results indicate that PF-06463922 has potential for treating ROS1 fusion-positive cancers, including those requiring agents with CNS-penetrating properties, as well as for overcoming crizotinib resistance driven by ROS1 mutation.",cancer
2428,Evaluation of EGFR as a prognostic and diagnostic marker for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients.,"Approximately 90% of all head and neck tumors are squamous cell carcinomas. The overall survival of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is low (≤50%). A non-invasive marker of disease progression is sorely required. The present study focused on the plasmatic levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in HNSCC patients (N=92) compared with healthy (N=29) and diabetic [type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); N=26] controls. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using antibodies against the extracellular region of EGFR (L25-S645) was performed. No significant changes were observed between diabetic and healthy controls. However, there were significantly higher EGFR plasma levels in HNSCC patients compared with both control groups (P=0.001 and 0.005, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified a sensitivity of 76.09%, a specificity of 67.27% and an area under curve of 0.727 for this comparison. No significant association was observed between EGFR plasma levels and tumor stage, tumor grade, lymph node or distant metastasis occurrence, smoking habit or hypertension. However, the presence of human papillomavirus infection and T2DM in HNSCC patients had borderline effect on the plasma EGFR levels. Survival analysis revealed no significant influence of plasmatic EGFR levels on the overall and disease-specific survival of HNSCC patients. In conclusion, EGFR plasma levels appear to be a relatively promising diagnostic, but poor prognostic, HNSCC marker.",nonCancer
462,Loss of NAPRT1 expression by tumor-specific promoter methylation provides a novel predictive biomarker for NAMPT inhibitors.,"We sought to identify predictive biomarkers for a novel nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) inhibitor. We use a NAMPT inhibitor, GNE-617, to evaluate nicotinic acid rescue status in a panel of more than 400 cancer cell lines. Using correlative analysis and RNA interference (RNAi), we identify a specific biomarker for nicotinic acid rescue status. We next determine the mechanism of regulation of expression of the biomarker. Finally, we develop immunohistochemical (IHC) and DNA methylation assays and evaluate cancer tissue for prevalence of the biomarker across indications. Nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (NAPRT1) is necessary for nicotinic acid rescue and its expression is the major determinant of rescue status. We demonstrate that NAPRT1 promoter methylation accounts for NAPRT1 deficiency in cancer cells, and NAPRT1 methylation is predictive of rescue status in cancer cell lines. Bisulfite next-generation sequencing mapping of the NAPRT1 promoter identified tumor-specific sites of NAPRT1 DNA methylation and enabled the development of a quantitative methylation-specific PCR (QMSP) assay suitable for use on archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Tumor-specific promoter hypermethylation of NAPRT1 inactivates one of two NAD salvage pathways, resulting in synthetic lethality with the coadministration of a NAMPT inhibitor. NAPRT1 expression is lost due to promoter hypermethylation in most cancer types evaluated at frequencies ranging from 5% to 65%. NAPRT1-specific immunohistochemical or DNA methylation assays can be used on archival formalin paraffin-embedded cancer tissue to identify patients likely to benefit from coadministration of a Nampt inhibitor and nicotinic acid.",cancer
1954,"Angiographic embolization for hemorrhage following pelvic fracture: Is it ""time"" for a paradigm shift?","Major pelvic disruption with hemorrhage has a high rate of lethality. Angiographic embolization remains the mainstay of treatment. Delays to angiography have been shown to worsen outcomes, in part because time spent awaiting mobilization of resources needed to perform angiography allows ongoing hemorrhage. Alternative techniques like pelvic pre-peritoneal packing (PPP) and aortic balloon occlusion (REBOA) now exist. We hypothesized that time to angiographic embolization at our level 1 trauma center would be longer than 90 minutes.|A retrospective review was performed of patients with pelvic fracture who underwent pelvic angiography at our trauma center over a 10 year period. The trauma registry was queried for age, sex, injury severity score (ISS), hemodynamic instability (HI) on presentation, and transfusion requirements within 24hrs. Charts were reviewed for time to angiography, embolization, and mortality.|4712 patients were admitted with pelvic fractures during the study period, 344 (7.3%) underwent pelvic angiography. Median ISS was 29. Median 24 hour transfusion requirements were 5 units of RBC's and 6 units of FFP. 151 (43.9%) presented with HI and 104 (30%) received massive transfusion (MT). Median time to angiography was 286 min (interquartile range [IQR] 210-378). Times were significantly shorter when stratified for HI (HI 264 vs stable 309 min; p=0.003), and MT (MT 230 vs non-MT 317min; p < 0.001), but still took nearly 4 hours. Overall mortality was 18%. Hemorrhage (35.5%) and sepsis/multiple organ failure (43.5%) accounted for most deaths.|Pelvic fracture hemorrhage remains a management challenge. In this series the median time to embolization was over 5 hours. Nearly 80% of deaths could be attributed to early uncontrolled hemorrhage and linked to delays in hemostasis. Earlier intervention by Acute Care Surgeons with techniques like PPP, REBOA, and utilization of hybrid operative suites may improve outcomes.|Therapeutic study, level IV.",nonCancer
1086,Combined PKC and MEK inhibition in uveal melanoma with GNAQ and GNA11 mutations.,"Uveal melanoma (UM) is a genetically and biologically distinct type of melanoma, and once metastatic there is no effective treatment currently available. Eighty percent of UMs harbor mutations in the Gαq family members GNAQ and GNA11. Understanding the effector pathways downstream of these oncoproteins is important to identify opportunities for targeted therapy. We report consistent activation of the protein kinase C (PKC) and MAPK pathways as a consequence of GNAQ or GNA11 mutation. PKC inhibition with AEB071 or AHT956 suppressed PKC and MAPK signalling and induced G1 arrest selectively in melanoma cell lines carrying GNAQ or GNA11 mutations. In contrast, treatment with two different MEK inhibitors, PD0325901 and MEK162, inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell lines irrespective of their mutation status, indicating that in the context of GNAQ or GNA11 mutation MAPK activation can be attributed to activated PKC. AEB071 significantly slowed the growth of tumors in an allograft model of GNAQ(Q209L)-transduced melanocytes, but did not induce tumor shrinkage. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that PKC inhibitors alone were unable to induce sustained suppression of MAP-kinase signaling. However, combinations of PKC and MEK inhibition, using either PD0325901or MEK162, led to sustained MAP-kinase pathway inhibition and showed a strong synergistic effect in halting proliferation and in inducing apoptosis in vitro. Furthermore, combining PKC and MEK inhibition was efficacious in vivo, causing marked tumor regression in a UM xenograft model. Our data identify PKC as a rational therapeutic target for melanoma patients with GNAQ or GNA11 mutations and demonstrate that combined MEK and PKC inhibition is synergistic, with superior efficacy compared to treatment with either approach alone.",cancer
1870,Anti-VP6 VHH: An Experimental Treatment for Rotavirus A-Associated Disease.,"Species A Rotaviruses (RVA) remain a leading cause of mortality in children under 5 years of age. Current treatment options are limited. We assessed the efficacy of two VP6-specific llama-derived heavy chain antibody fragments (VHH) -2KD1 and 3B2- as an oral prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against RVA-induced diarrhea in a neonatal mouse model inoculated with virulent murine RVA (ECw, G16P[16]I7). Joint therapeutic administration of 2KD1+3B2 (200 μg/dose) successfully reduced diarrhea duration, RVA infection severity and virus shedding in feces. While the same dose of 2KD1 or 3B2 (200 μg) significantly reduced duration of RVA-induced diarrhea, 2KD1 was more effective in diminishing the severity of intestinal infection and RVA shedding in feces, perhaps because 2KD1 presented higher binding affinity for RVA particles than 3B2. Neither prophylactic nor therapeutic administration of the VHH interfered with the host's humoral immune response against RVA. When 2KD1 (200 μg) was administered after diarrhea development, it also significantly reduced RVA intestinal infection and fecal shedding. Host antibody responses against the oral VHH treatment were not detected, nor did viral escape mutants. Our findings show that oral administration of anti-VP6 VHH constitute, not only an effective prophylactic treatment against RVA-associated diarrhea, but also a safe therapeutic tool against RVA infection, even once diarrhea is present. Anti-VP6 VHH could be used complementary to ongoing vaccination, especially in populations that have shown lower immunization efficacy. These VHH could also be scaled-up to develop pediatric medication or functional food like infant milk formulas that might help treat RVA diarrhea.",nonCancer
2137,Dietary supplementation with myo-inositol in women during pregnancy for treating gestational diabetes.,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is any degree of glucose intolerance that first presents and is recognised during pregnancy and usually resolves after the birth of the baby. GDM is associated with increased short- and long-term morbidity for the mother and her baby. Treatment usually includes lifestyle modification and/or pharmacological therapy (oral antidiabetic agents or insulin) with the aim to maintain treatment targets for blood glucose concentrations. Finding novel treatment agents which are effective, acceptable and safe for the mother and her baby are important. One such emerging potential intervention is myo-inositol which is an isomer of inositol and occurs endogenously and is found in natural dietary sources such as fruits, vegetables, nuts and cereals.|To assess if dietary supplementation with myo-inositol during pregnancy is safe and effective, for the mother and fetus, in treating gestational diabetes.|We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 April 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (7 April 2016), and reference lists of retrieved studies.|All published and unpublished randomised controlled trials or cluster-randomised controlled trials reporting on the use of myo-inositol compared with placebo, no treatment or another intervention for the treatment of women with gestational diabetes. Quasi-randomised and cross-over studies are not eligible for inclusion. Women with pre-existing diabetes were excluded.|Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. For key outcomes (where data were available), we assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.|We included two studies (142 women and infants), both were conducted in women in Italy and compared myo-inositol with a placebo control.None of the maternal primary outcomes pre-specified for this review were reported in the included studies: hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; caesarean section; development of subsequent type 2 diabetes mellitus. No data were reported for the majority of this review's maternal secondary outcomes. We could only perform meta-analysis for two secondary outcomes: fasting oral glucose tolerance test and additional pharmacological treatment. All other results are based on data from single studies. Overall, the risk of bias of the included studies was judged to be unclear due to lack of key methodological information.There was no evidence of a difference between treatment groups in need for additional pharmacotherapy or weight gain during pregnancy, although myo-inositol was associated with a lower body mass index (BMI) change (mean difference (MD) -1.50 kg/m(2); 95% confidence interval (CI) -2.35 to -0.65; one trial, n = 73). Myo-inositol was associated with a reduction in the fasting blood glucose concentration at the end of treatment (MD -0.47 mmol/L; 95% CI -0.59 to -0.35; two trials, n = 142 women) compared with the control group. One small trial reported that myo-inositol was associated with a reduction in one-hour post-prandial blood glucose concentration at the end of treatment (MD -0.90 mmol/L; 95% CI -1.73 to -0.07; one trial, n = 73 women) compared with the control group. There was no difference between groups for the two-hour post-prandial blood glucose concentrations between groups (MD -0.70 mmol/L; 95% CI -1.46 to 0.06; one trial, n = 73 women). The one-hour and two-hour blood glucose concentrations show evidence of imprecision associated with wide CIs and small sample size.For the infant, there was no evidence of a difference in the risk for being born large-for-gestational age between the myo-inositol and the control group (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.02 to 8.58; one trial, n = 73 infants; low-quality evidence). The evidence was downgraded due to imprecision. This review's other primary outcomes were not reported in the included trials: perinatal mortality (stillbirth and neonatal mortality); mortality of morbidity composite (as defined by the trials); neurosensory disability. Infants in the myo-inositol group were less likely to have neonatal hypoglycaemia compared with the placebo group (RR 0.05; 95% CI 0.00 to 0.85; one study, n = 73 infants; low-quality evidence). There is evidence of imprecision for this outcome with low event rates and small sample size. There was no evidence of a difference between treatment and placebo groups for preterm birth or birthweight. Myo-inositol was associated with a later gestational age at birth compared with the placebo group (MD 2.10 weeks; 95% CI 1.27 to 2.93; one trial, n = 73 infants). No data were reported for any of the other neonatal outcomes for this review.No long-term outcomes were reported for the mother, infant as a child, infant as an adult, or health service outcomes.|There are insufficient data to evaluate the effect of myo-inositol for the treatment of gestational diabetes, with no data to examine the majority of outcomes in this review. There do not appear to be any benefits for the infant associated with exposure to myo-inositol such as reduced risk of being born large-for-gestational age. Although the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia is reduced for the myo-inositol group, there is evidence of imprecision. Evidence from two studies suggested that myo-inositol was associated with a reduced change in maternal BMI and fasting blood sugar concentration compared with placebo. There is a lack of reporting of the clinically meaningful outcomes pre-specified for this review.Uncertainty of the effectiveness of myo-inositol as a treatment for GDM for key maternal and infant outcomes remains and further high- quality trials with appropriate sample sizes are required to further investigate the role of myo-inositol as a treatment or co-treatment for women with gestational diabetes. Future trials should report on the core outcomes for GDM identified in the methods section of this review. Participants of varying ethnicities and with varying risk factors for GDM should be included in future trials. In addition, further trials of myo-inositol for the treatment of GDM should explore the optimal dose, frequency and timing of supplementation, report on adverse effects and assess the long- term effects of this intervention. Economic analysis or health service use and costs should also be included.",nonCancer

1228,"Establishment and characterization of a novel Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia cell line, MWCL-1.","Waldenström macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma characterized by hypersecretion of immunoglobulin M (IgM) protein and tumor infiltration into the bone marrow and lymphatic tissue. Our understanding of the mechanisms driving the development and progression of WM is currently by the shortage of representative cell models available for study. We describe here the establishment of a new WM cell line, MWCL-1. Comprehensive genetic analyses have unequivocally confirmed a clonal relationship between this novel cell line and the founding tumor. MWCL-1 cells exhibit an immunophenotype consistent with a diverse, tumor clone composed of both small B lymphocytes and larger lymphoplasmacytic cells and plasma cells: CD3⁻, CD19⁺, CD20⁺, CD27⁺, CD38⁺, CD49D⁺, CD138⁺, cIgM⁺, and κ⁺. Cytogenetic studies identified a monoallelic deletion of 17p13 (TP53) in both the cell line and the primary tumor. Direct DNA resequencing of the remaining copy of TP53 revealed a missense mutation at exon 5 (V143A, GTG>GCG). In accordance with primary WM tumors, MWCL-1 cells retain the ability to secrete high amounts of IgM protein in the absence of an external stimulus.

The current study assessed the effects of aqueous date fruit extract (ADFE) on the aforementioned parameters.|In this experimental study, diffused traumatic brain injury (TBI) was generated in adult male rats using Marmarou's method. Experimental groups include two pre-treatment (oral ADFE, 4 and 8 mL/kg for 14 days), vehicle (distilled water, for 14 days) and sham groups. Brain edema and neuronal injury were measured 72 hours after TBI. Veterinary coma scale (VCS) and ICP were determined at -1, 4, 24, 48 and 72 hours after TBI. Differences among multiple groups were assessed using ANOVA. Turkey's test was employed for the ANOVA post-hoc analysis. The criterion of statistical significance was sign at P<0.05.|Brain water content in ADFE-treated groups was decreased in comparison with the TBI+vehicle group.

1972,The role of memory in distinguishing risky decisions from experience and description.,"People's risk preferences differ for choices based on described probabilities versus those based on information learned through experience. For decisions from description, people are typically more risk averse for gains than for losses. In contrast, for decisions from experience, people are sometimes more risk seeking for gains than losses, especially for choices with the possibility of extreme outcomes (big wins or big losses), which are systematically overweighed in memory. Using a within-subject design, this study evaluated whether this memory bias plays a role in the differences in risky choice between description and experience. As in previous studies, people were more risk seeking for losses than for gains in description but showed the opposite pattern in experience. People also more readily remembered the extreme outcomes and judged them as having occurred more frequently. These memory biases correlated with risk preferences in decisions from experience but not in decisions from description. These results suggest that systematic memory biases may be responsible for some of the differences in risk preference across description and experience.",nonCancer

2381,Antioxidant efficiency of lycopene on oxidative stress - induced damage in bovine spermatozoa.,"Lycopene (LYC) is a natural carotenoid with powerful reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging activities. The aim of this study was to investigate if lycopene has the ability to reverse ROS-mediated alterations to the motility, viability and intracellular antioxidant profile of bovine spermatozoa subjected to ferrous ascorbate (FeAA). Spermatozoa were washed out of fresh bovine semen, suspended in 2.9 % sodium citrate and subjected to LYC treatment (0.25, 0.5, 1 or 2 mmol/L) in the presence or absence of FeAA (150 μmol/L FeSO4 and 750 μmol/L ascorbic acid) during a 6 h in vitro culture. Spermatozoa motion characteristics were assessed using the SpermVision™ computer-aided sperm analysis (CASA) system. Cell viability was examined with the metabolic activity (MTT) assay, ROS generation was quantified via luminometry and the nitroblue-tetrazolium (NBT) test was applied to quantify the intracellular superoxide formation. Cell lysates were prepared at the end of the in vitro culture to investigate the intracellular activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as well as the concentrations of glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA).|FeAA treatment led to a reduced spermatozoa motility (P < 0.001), viability (P < 0.001) and a decline of the antioxidant capacity of spermatozoa (P < 0.001) but increased the ROS generation (P < 0.001), superoxide production (P < 0.001) and lipid peroxidation (P < 0.001). LYC administration resulted in a preservation of the spermatozoa motion parameters (P < 0.001), mitochondrial activity (P < 0.001) and antioxidant characteristics (P < 0.001 with respect to SOD; P < 0.01 in relation to CAT; P < 0.05 as for GPx and GSH) with a concentration range of 1 and 2 mmol/L LYC revealed to be the most effective.|Our results suggest that LYC exhibits significant ROS-scavenging and antioxidant properties which may prevent spermatozoa alterations caused by oxidative stress, and preserve the functionality of male reproductive cells.",nonCancer

Totally, 79 non-duplicate clinical E. coli isolates included in this study were mainly from skin lesion -36 (45.6%) isolates; 54 (68.4%) isolates were assigned to phylogenetic B2 group. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 20 isolates. In the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) region of gyrA and parC, 4 types of point mutations were detected. Mutations in parC gene were found in all strains with gyrA mutations. Predominance of double mutation in codon 83 and 87 of gyrA (90%) and in codon 80 of parC (90%) was found. Moreover, plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMRQ) determinants (qnrA or qnrB and/or aac(6')-Ib-cr) were present in 5 (25%) out of 20 fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in all of the tested clinical E. coli isolates correlated with point mutations in both gyrA and parC. The majority of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains belonged to D and B2 phylogenetic groups.",nonCancer
1273,Reducing Undercarboxylated Osteocalcin with Vitamin K Supplementation does not Promote Lean Tissue Loss or Fat Gain Over Three Years in Older Women and Men: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Osteocalcin (OC) is a vitamin K-dependent protein synthesized during bone formation. Mice injected with the undercarboxylated form of OC (ucOC) had more skeletal muscle mass and less fat mass than sham-treated controls, suggesting a unique metabolic role for ucOC. UcOC decreases in response to vitamin K supplementation. Our objective was to determine the effect of reducing ucOC on change in lean tissue and fat mass in older community-dwelling adults (n = 401, mean ± SD 69 ± 6 years) using data from a randomized controlled trial of vitamin K supplementation Over 3 years, serum ucOC was reduced by 58% in women and by 61% in men randomized to vitamin K, while in the control group ucOC decreased by 1% in women and 4% in men (supplementation*time p < 0.001 in men and women). However, there were no differences in the change in appendicular lean mass (calculated as arm lean mass + leg lean mass) or total body fat mass between women randomized to vitamin K and control over 3 years (supplementation*time p-values all ≥0.18) or between men randomized to vitamin K and control (supplementation*time p-values all ≥0.54). Consistent with these findings, ucOC was not associated cross-sectionally with appendicular lean mass or fat mass in men or women after adjustment for total OC at baseline (all p ≥0.12). These findings indicate the undercarboxylated form of OC is not implicated in age-related changes in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue mass in older community-dwelling adults.

368,Mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib in patients with ALK gene rearranged non-small cell lung cancer.,"Patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements often manifest dramatic responses to crizotinib, a small-molecule ALK inhibitor. Unfortunately, not every patient responds and acquired drug resistance inevitably develops in those who do respond. This study aimed to define molecular mechanisms of resistance to crizotinib in patients with ALK(+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed tissue obtained from 14 patients with ALK(+) NSCLC showing evidence of radiologic progression while on crizotinib to define mechanisms of intrinsic and acquired resistance to crizotinib. Eleven patients had material evaluable for molecular analysis. Four patients (36%) developed secondary mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of ALK. A novel mutation in the ALK domain, encoding a G1269A amino acid substitution that confers resistance to crizotinib in vitro, was identified in two of these cases. Two patients, one with a resistance mutation, exhibited new onset ALK copy number gain (CNG). One patient showed outgrowth of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutant NSCLC without evidence of a persistent ALK gene rearrangement. Two patients exhibited a KRAS mutation, one of which occurred without evidence of a persisting ALK gene rearrangement. One patient showed the emergence of an ALK gene fusion-negative tumor compared with the baseline sample but with no identifiable alternate driver. Two patients retained ALK positivity with no identifiable resistance mechanism. Crizotinib resistance in ALK(+) NSCLC occurs through somatic kinase domain mutations, ALK gene fusion CNG, and emergence of separate oncogenic drivers.",cancer
811,"Lapatinib with trastuzumab for HER2-positive early breast cancer (NeoALTTO): a randomised, open-label, multicentre, phase 3 trial.","The anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib have complementary mechanisms of action and synergistic antitumour activity in models of HER2-overexpressing breast cancer. We argue that the two anti-HER2 agents given together would be better than single-agent therapy. In this parallel groups, randomised, open-label, phase 3 study undertaken between Jan 5, 2008, and May 27, 2010, women from 23 countries with HER2-positive primary breast cancer with tumours greater than 2 cm in diameter were randomly assigned to oral lapatinib (1500 mg), intravenous trastuzumab (loading dose 4 mg/kg [DOSAGE ERROR CORRECTED], subsequent doses 2 mg/kg), or lapatinib (1000 mg) plus trastuzumab. Treatment allocation was by stratified, permuted blocks randomisation, with four stratification factors. Anti-HER2 therapy alone was given for the first 6 weeks; weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) was then added to the regimen for a further 12 weeks, before definitive surgery was undertaken. After surgery, patients received adjuvant chemotherapy followed by the same targeted therapy as in the neoadjuvant phase to 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the rate of pathological complete response (pCR), analysed by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00553358. 154 patients received lapatinib, 149 trastuzumab, and 152 the combination. pCR rate was significantly higher in the group given lapatinib and trastuzumab (78 of 152 patients [51·3%; 95% CI 43·1-59·5]) than in the group given trastuzumab alone (44 of 149 patients [29·5%; 22·4-37·5]; difference 21·1%, 9·1-34·2, p=0·0001). We recorded no significant difference in pCR between the lapatinib (38 of 154 patients [24·7%, 18·1-32·3]) and the trastuzumab (difference -4·8%, -17·6 to 8·2, p=0·34) groups. No major cardiac dysfunctions occurred. Frequency of grade 3 diarrhoea was higher with lapatinib (36 patients [23·4%]) and lapatinib plus trastuzumab (32 [21·1%]) than with trastuzumab (three [2·0%]). Similarly, grade 3 liver-enzyme alterations were more frequent with lapatinib (27 [17·5%]) and lapatinib plus trastuzumab (15 [9·9%]) than with trastuzumab (11 [7·4%]). Dual inhibition of HER2 might be a valid approach to treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting. GlaxoSmithKline.",cancer

1835,Temporary Percutaneous Pedicle Screw Stabilization Without Fusion of Adolescent Thoracolumbar Spine Fractures.,"Pediatric spine trauma often results from high-energy mechanisms. Despite differences in healing potential, comorbidities, and length of remaining life, treatment is frequently based on adult criteria; ligamentous injuries are fused and bony injuries are treated accordingly. In this study, we present short-term results of a select group of adolescent patients treated using percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation without fusion.|An IRB-approved retrospective review was performed at a level 1 pediatric trauma center for thoracolumbar spine fractures treated by percutaneous pedicle screw instrumentation. Patients were excluded if arthrodesis was performed or if instrumentation was not removed. Demographics, injury mechanism, associated injuries, fracture classification, surgical data, radiographic measures, and complications were collected. Radiographs were analyzed for sagittal and coronal wedge angles and vertebral body height ratio and statistical comparisons performed on preoperative and postoperative values.|Between 2005 and 2013, 46 patients were treated surgically. Fourteen patients (5 male, 9 female) met inclusion criteria. Injury mechanisms included 8 motor vehicle collisions, 4 falls, and 2 all-terrain vehicle/motorcycle collisions. There were 8 Magerl type A injuries, 4 type B injuries, and 2 type C injuries. There was 1 incomplete spinal cord injury. Implants were removed between 5 and 12 months in 12 patients and after 12 months in 2 patients. Statistical analysis revealed significant postoperative improvement in all radiographic measures (P<0.05). There were no neurological complications, 1 superficial wound dehiscence, and 2 instrumentation failures (treated with standard removal). At last follow-up, 11 patients returned to unrestricted activities including sports. Average follow-up was 9 months after implant removal and 19.3 months after index procedure.|Adolescent thoracolumbar fractures present unique challenges and treatment opportunities different from the adult patient.

After phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation, the Ex-PRESS (R-50) was inserted into the anterior chamber under a scleral flap. The intraocular pressure (IOP), best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), number of medications, and complications were recorded preoperatively as well as postoperatively on day 7 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.The mean follow-up was 16.4 ± 2.5 months (range 14-21 months) and the mean age of the patients was 64.7 ± 6.8 years (range 56-78 years). The mean IOP was 20.4 ± 5.4 mm Hg preoperatively and decreased to 10.2 ± 2.8, 13.1 ± 2.7, 14.9 ± 4.1, 14.3 ± 3.9, and 14.0 ± 3.6 mm Hg on day 7 and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery (all P < 0.005).

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association of body volume with body fatness and metabolic syndrome. This study included 38 Korean women whose body volume was measured using 3DBS. We measured body fatness using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and computed tomography. Participants with metabolic syndrome were defined as having three or more of the following components: high blood pressure (≥130/85 mmHg), elevated fasting glucose (≥100 mg/dl), hypertriglyceridemia (≥150 mg/dl), low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (<50 mg/dl), and abdominal obesity measured by waist circumference ≥80 cm. Total body, trunk, lower trunk, and limb volumes were significantly correlated with body mass index, waist circumference, total fat mass, percentage body fat, and abdominal fat areas. After adjustment for age, current smoking, at-risk drinking, and physical inactivity, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for metabolic syndrome associated with total body, trunk, lower trunk, and limb volume were 1.08 (1.01-1.16), 1.11 (1.01-1.22), 1.20 (1.01-1.43), and 1.31 (1.04-1.66), respectively.

1895,Preparation of Nanowire Silica inside Self-Assembled Sodium Bis(2-Ethylhexyl) Sulfosuccinate (AOT) Gels.,"In conventional sol-gel methods, gel formation occurs due to aggregation of particles into irregular shapes of larger size. In this study, we conducted hydrolysis-condensation reactions of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) within water-laden channels inside the space created by self-assembled AOT molecules to prepare regular and nano-sized silica in self-assembled sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate (AOT) gels. The AOT gels were obtained by adding small amounts of water to organic solvents containing high concentrations of AOT. Adding silica significantly influenced the rheological properties and microstructures of these AOT/silica gels. Rheological studies showed that the storage modulus G' and loss modulus G"" of the AOT gel systems became very close and even crossed, indicating that the gel is ""weak""; however, for the AOT/silica gel systems, the rheological data demonstrated that G' is greater than G"" at all frequencies, indicative of a real gel with a G' of approximately 10(5) pa. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results showed that the gels initially had a hexagonal close-packed cylindrical structure with long-range order and transitioned to non-close-packed cylindrical structures without long range order as the silica formed. The cylinder is expected to comprise stacks of silica molecules surrounded by AOT molecules, and the radius of the cylinder is close to the sum of the length of one AOT molecule and half the size of one silica molecule. The rheological and SAXS data show that silica in the AOT/silica systems grew in the axial direction due to the confinement of these cylindrical structures, leading to nanowire silica structures. After removal of the AOT components, the nanowire silica was approximately 5-10 nm in diameter, as observed using transmission electron microscopy (TEM).",nonCancer

However, little attention has been apparently given to habitual food consumption in patients suffering a cerebrovascular event.|To assess the influence of dietary habits as well as other lifestyle-related variables on the risk of suffering a stroke.|A case-control study was designed. Fifty-one cases (age: 59.1 ± 9.1y.o; BMI; 30.8 ± 3.4 kg/m(2)) and 51 controls (age: 61.1 ± 9.1y.o; BMI; 30.4 ± 3.6 kg/m(2)) were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric and body composition variables were measured. Dietary information was obtained from a validated food frequency questionnaire. Physical activity and lifestyle-related factors were assessed. Blood samples were drawn.|Patients suffering a stroke showed higher prevalence of diabetes (30 vs. 7.7%; P = 0.020) and hypertension (74.5 vs. 40.3%; P < 0.001) and were less physically active (36.7 vs. 66.6%; P = 0.024) than controls. Patients registered worse glucose and lipid profiles, higher levels of hepatic biomarkers, and higher blood cell counts than controls. Stroked patients showed lower adherence to a statistically derived healthy dietary pattern than controls (23.5 vs. 42.3%; P = 0.017). A logistic regression model was built up considering hypertension, diabetes, smoking, physical activity, adherence to a 'healthy dietary pattern' and C-reactive protein concentration.

Four hundred ninety-nine children with ALL from the ALL-BFM (Berlin-Frankfurt-Münster) 2000 trial who received 1996 courses of MTX at 5 g/m(2) were genotyped for 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms in 5 candidate genes of the MTX/folate pathway. Patients' MTX pharmacokinetics, MTX toxicities, and outcomes were correlated with the genotypes. The interindividual variability in MTX kinetics had a substantial genetic component between 68% and 75%. The SLCO1B1 rs4149056 variant was significantly associated with MTX kinetics. In a multiple regression model, MTX area under the concentration time curve (AUC)0-48h increased by 26% (P < .001) per SLCO1B1 rs4149056 C allele. MTX AUC0-48h was a significant predictor of overall toxic adverse events during MTX courses (R(2) = 0.043; P < .001), whereas the thymidylate synthase rs34743033 tandem repeat polymorphism was predictive of stomatitis (R(2) = 0.018; P = .009), a frequent side effect of high-dose MTX. Multiple Cox regression analyses revealed an association of minimal residual disease (hazard ratio 7.3; P < .001) and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase rs1801131 (hazard ratio 3.1; P = .015) with event-free survival in the ALL-BFM 2000 study population.

1840,Monte Carlo MP2 on Many GPUs.,"In the Monte Carlo second-order many-body perturbation (MC-MP2) method, the long sum-of-product matrix expression of the MP2 energy, whose literal evaluation may be poorly scalable, is recast into a single high-dimensional integral of functions of electron pair coordinates, which is evaluated by the scalable method of Monte Carlo integration. The sampling efficiency is further accelerated by the redundant-walker algorithm, which allows a maximal reuse of electron pairs. Here, a multitude of graphical processing units (GPUs) offers a uniquely ideal platform to expose multilevel parallelism: fine-grain data-parallelism for the redundant-walker algorithm in which millions of threads compute and share orbital amplitudes on each GPU; coarse-grain instruction-parallelism for near-independent Monte Carlo integrations on many GPUs with few and infrequent interprocessor communications. While the efficiency boost by the redundant-walker algorithm on central processing units (CPUs) grows linearly with thenumber of electron pairs and tends to saturate when the latter exceeds the number of orbitals, on a GPU it grows quadratically before it increases linearly and then eventually saturate at a much larger number of pairs. This is because the orbital constructions are nearly perfectly parallelized on a GPU and thus completed in a near-constant time regardless of the number of pairs. In consequence, an MC-MP2/cc-pVDZ calculation of a benzene dimer is 2,700 times faster on 256 GPUs (using 2,048 electron pairs) than on two CPUs, each with 8 cores (which can use only up to 256 pairs effectively). We also numerically determine that the cost to achieve a given relative statistical uncertainty in an MC-MP2 energy increases as O(n(3)) or better with system size n, which may be compared with the O(n(5)) scaling of the conventional implementation of deterministic MP2. We thus establish MC-MP2's scalability with both system and computer sizes.",nonCancer
873,Deficiency of the ATM protein expression defines an aggressive subgroup of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"The gene mutated in ataxia telangiectasia, ATM, on human chromosome 11q22-q23 is implicated in cell cycle control and DNA repair. Ataxia telangiectasia patients as well as ATM-deficient mice are immune deficient and develop lymphoproliferative disease. Abnormalities in 11q22.3-q23.1 have also been described in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL). We analyzed B-CLL samples for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) using microsatellite markers located at the ATM (D11S2179), mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL; D11S1356), and BCL1 (D11S987) loci, all of which are located around 11q23. Five (14%) of 36 informative cases showed LOH at the ATM gene, and two of these five cases had LOH at the MLL gene. No LOH was detected at the BCL1 locus, and none of the cases showed LOH at the MLL gene without LOH at the ATM gene. Four of these five cases with LOH at the ATM gene were studied for ATM protein expression by Western blot analysis. All four cases lacked ATM protein. An additional 111 cases of B-CLL were studied for expression of ATM protein by Western blot analysis and RIA. Thirty-eight (34%) of these cases showed ATM levels <50% of that seen in normal lymphoid cells. No morphological or immunophenotypic difference was observed between ATM-deficient B-CLL cases and cases with normal ATM expression. However, patients with ATM deficiency had significantly shorter survival times (35.66 versus 97.3 months; P = 0.003) and more aggressive disease, suggesting that ATM is involved in the leukemogenesis of B-CLL. These data also suggest that the ATM gene may play a role in the reported 11q23 abnormality in B-CLL, which also characterizes an aggressive disease.",cancer

Our study aims to determine ERBB2 and ERBB3 mutations frequencies in grade 3 and/or ERBB2-positive invasive lobular breast carcinomas (ILC). All the 529 ILC surgically-excised registered at Institut Curie in the years 2005 to 2008 were reviewed. Thirty-nine grade 3 ERBB2-negative ILC and 16 ERBB2-positive ILC were retrieved and subjected to Sanger sequencing of the ERBB2 and ERBB3 activation mutation hotspots (ERBB2: exons 8, 17, 19, 20, 21; ERBB3: exons 3, 6, 7, 8). Among the 39 grade 3 ERBB2-negative ILC, six tumors were found to have at least one detectable ERBB2 activating mutation (incidence rate: 15%, 95%CI [4%-27%]). No ERBB2 mutation was found among the 16 ERBB2-positive ILC. No ERBB3 mutation was found in any of the 55 ILC. ERBB2 mutations were statistically associated with solid ILC features (p=0.01). Survival analyses showed no significant prognostic impact of ERBB2 mutations. Our study demonstrates that high grade ERBB2-negative ILC display a high frequency of ERBB2 mutations, and should be subjected to systematic genetic screening.",nonCancer

The association between agitation/aggression following stroke and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in stroke survivors is unknown. This study aimed to examine the association between agitation/aggression and HRQoL in Chinese stroke survivors.|Three hundred and twenty-four stroke patients entered this cross-sectional study. Agitation/aggression was assessed using the Chinese version of Neuropsychiatric Inventory (CNPI). HRQoL was measured with the Stroke Specific Quality of Life (SSQoL).|Three months after the index stroke, agitation/aggression was found in 60 (18.5%) patients. In the agitation/aggression group, 44 patients (73.3%) showed passive agitation/aggression, whereas 16 (26.7%) displayed passive and active agitation/aggression. No patients showed only active agitation/aggression. Patients with agitation/aggression were more likely to have history of diabetes and greater severity of depression, as well as lower SSQoL total score and Personality Changes and Social Role scores. Controlling for diabetes and depression severity did not alter the above results. The Energy and Thinking scores of the SSQoL were significantly lower in the passive/active agitation/aggression group relative to the passive agitation/aggression group (adjusted for CNPI aggression/agitation score).|In this study sample, agitation/aggression was preponderantly of the passive type and was associated with poorer HRQoL independently from depression or medical conditions.

1623,Increased GABA concentrations in type 2 diabetes mellitus are related to lower cognitive functioning.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is associated with accelerated cognitive decline. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms still remain to be elucidated although it is known that insulin signaling modulates neurotransmitter activity, including inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and excitatory glutamate (Glu) receptors. Therefore, we examined whether levels of GABA and Glu are related to diabetes status and cognitive performance.Forty-one participants with type 2 diabetes and 39 participants without type 2 diabetes underwent detailed cognitive assessments and 3-Tesla proton MR spectroscopy. The associations of neurotransmitters with type 2 diabetes and cognitive performance were examined using multivariate regression analyses controlling for age, sex, education, BMI, and percentage gray/white matter ratio in spectroscopic voxel.Analysis revealed higher GABA+ levels in participants with type 2 diabetes, in participants with higher fasting blood glucose levels and in participants with higher HbA1c levels, and higher GABA+ levels in participants with both high HbA1c levels and less cognitive performance.To conclude, participants with type 2 diabetes have alterations in the GABAergic neurotransmitter system, which are related to lower cognitive functioning, and hint at the involvement of an underlying metabolic mechanism.",nonCancer

Our objective is to provide evidence of validity and reliability for a pictorial vegetable behavioral assessment for use by federally funded community nutrition programs. Parent/child pairs (n=133) from HeadStart and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children [WIC] provided parent-administered vegetable tools, three child 24-hour diet recalls, child blood sample and measured heights/weights. The 10-item scale, with an alpha of .83 and a stability reliability coefficient of .74, was positively related to vegetables in cup equivalents [p<.05]; micronutrients folate, vitamin C, β-carotene, potassium and magnesium [p≤.05-.01]; and soluble fiber [p≤.001]. The child vegetable scores were related to the parent's mediators [p<.00001] and vegetable behaviors [p<.00001]. Children's plasma inflammatory markers were negatively related to the 10 item scale [p<.05] and are indicators of the child's health status. The positive relationship between the serum carotenoid index and a sub-scale of child vegetable behaviors offered additional support for criterion validity [p≤.05]. Finally, the inverse relationship of BMI-for-age percentile one year post baseline and a sub-scale of child vegetable behaviors supported the predictive validity [p<.05]. Focus on Veggies, a simple assessment tool, can inform practitioners about the child's health status. A child with a high score, shows a healthful profile with a lower inflammation index, higher carotenoid index, lower BMI and higher vegetable intake. In conclusion, validity of Focus on Veggies has been demonstrated using vegetable cup equivalents and micronutrient intakes, anthropometry and blood biomarkers.",nonCancer
2352,Therapeutic options for peritoneal metastasis arising from colorectal cancer.,"Peritoneal metastasis is a common sign of advanced tumor stage, tumor progression or tumor recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer. Due to the improvement of systemic chemotherapy, the development of targeted therapy and the introduction of additive treatment options such as cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), the therapeutic approach to peritoneal metastatic colorectal cancer (pmCRC) has changed over recent decades, and patient survival has improved. Moreover, in contrast to palliative systemic chemotherapy or best supportive care, the inclusion of CRS and HIPEC as inherent components of a multidisciplinary treatment regimen provides a therapeutic approach with curative intent. Although CRS and HIPEC are increasingly accepted as the standard of care for selected patients and have become part of numerous national and international guidelines, the individual role, optimal timing and ideal sequence of the different systemic, local and surgical treatment options remains a matter of debate. Ongoing and future randomized controlled clinical trials may help clarify the impact of the different components, allow for further improvement of patient selection and support the standardization of oncologic treatment regimens for pmCRC. The addition of further therapeutic options such as neoadjuvant intraperitoneal chemotherapy or pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy, should be investigated to optimize therapeutic regimens and further improve the oncological outcome.",nonCancer

791,Unresponsiveness of colon cancer to BRAF(V600E) inhibition through feedback activation of EGFR.,"Inhibition of the BRAF(V600E) oncoprotein by the small-molecule drug PLX4032 (vemurafenib) is highly effective in the treatment of melanoma. However, colon cancer patients harbouring the same BRAF(V600E) oncogenic lesion have poor prognosis and show only a very limited response to this drug. To investigate the cause of the limited therapeutic effect of PLX4032 in BRAF(V600E) mutant colon tumours, here we performed an RNA-interference-based genetic screen in human cells to search for kinases whose knockdown synergizes with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We report that blockade of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) shows strong synergy with BRAF(V600E) inhibition. We find in multiple BRAF(V600E) mutant colon cancers that inhibition of EGFR by the antibody drug cetuximab or the small-molecule drugs gefitinib or erlotinib is strongly synergistic with BRAF(V600E) inhibition, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we find that BRAF(V600E) inhibition causes a rapid feedback activation of EGFR, which supports continued proliferation in the presence of BRAF(V600E) inhibition. Melanoma cells express low levels of EGFR and are therefore not subject to this feedback activation. Consistent with this, we find that ectopic expression of EGFR in melanoma cells is sufficient to cause resistance to PLX4032.

During the course of a clinical trial of whole genomic sequencing seeking druggable targets, we examined six patients with advanced cholangiocarcinoma. Integrated genome-wide and whole transcriptome sequence analyses were performed on tumors from six patients with advanced, sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (SIC) to identify potential therapeutically actionable events. Among the somatic events captured in our analysis, we uncovered two novel therapeutically relevant genomic contexts that when acted upon, resulted in preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Genome-wide structural analysis of sequence data revealed recurrent translocation events involving the FGFR2 locus in three of six assessed patients. These observations and supporting evidence triggered the use of FGFR inhibitors in these patients. In one example, preliminary anti-tumor activity of pazopanib (in vitro FGFR2 IC50≈350 nM) was noted in a patient with an FGFR2-TACC3 fusion. After progression on pazopanib, the same patient also had stable disease on ponatinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor (in vitro, FGFR2 IC50≈8 nM). In an independent non-FGFR2 translocation patient, exome and transcriptome analysis revealed an allele specific somatic nonsense mutation (E384X) in ERRFI1, a direct negative regulator of EGFR activation. Rapid and robust disease regression was noted in this ERRFI1 inactivated tumor when treated with erlotinib, an EGFR kinase inhibitor. FGFR2 fusions and ERRFI mutations may represent novel targets in sporadic intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and trials should be characterized in larger cohorts of patients with these aberrations.",cancer
856,"Germline BRCA mutations are associated with higher risk of nodal involvement, distant metastasis, and poor survival outcomes in prostate cancer.","To analyze the baseline clinicopathologic characteristics of prostate tumors with germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) mutations and the prognostic value of those mutations on prostate cancer (PCa) outcomes. This study analyzed the tumor features and outcomes of 2,019 patients with PCa (18 BRCA1 carriers, 61 BRCA2 carriers, and 1,940 noncarriers). The Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression analysis were used to evaluate the associations between BRCA1/2 status and other PCa prognostic factors with overall survival (OS), cause-specific OS (CSS), CSS in localized PCa (CSS_M0), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and CSS from metastasis (CSS_M1). PCa with germline BRCA1/2 mutations were more frequently associated with Gleason ≥ 8 (P = .00003), T3/T4 stage (P = .003), nodal involvement (P = .00005), and metastases at diagnosis (P = .005) than PCa in noncarriers. CSS was significantly longer in noncarriers than in carriers (15.7 v 8.6 years, multivariable analyses [MVA] P = .015; hazard ratio [HR] = 1.8). For localized PCa, 5-year CSS and MFS were significantly higher in noncarriers (96% v 82%; MVA P = .01; HR = 2.6%; and 93% v 77%; MVA P = .009; HR = 2.7, respectively). Subgroup analyses confirmed the poor outcomes in BRCA2 patients, whereas the role of BRCA1 was not well defined due to the limited size and follow-up in this subgroup. Our results confirm that BRCA1/2 mutations confer a more aggressive PCa phenotype with a higher probability of nodal involvement and distant metastasis. BRCA mutations are associated with poor survival outcomes and this should be considered for tailoring clinical management of these patients.",cancer
1664,Hereditary pancreatitis of 3 Chinese children: Case report and literature review.,"Hereditary pancreatitis (HP) is quite rare and is distinguished by incomplete penetrance presentation as early-onset relapsing pancreatitis, usually beginning in childhood. HP is now known to be commonly relevant to mutations in the PRSS1 (gene-encoding cationic trypsinogen), SPINK1 (serine protease inhibitor, Kazal type 1), CFTR (cystic fibrosis), carboxypeptidase A1 (CPA1), and chymotrypsin C (CTRC) genes as reported in some Caucasian studies. HP has a variable spectrum of severity and may develop complications.|We describe the clinical course of 3 preschool children, hospitalized with postprandial abdominal pain, whose laboratory tests showed high serum amylase. Similar episodes of abdominal pain led to readmission, and the patients recovered quickly after using symptomatic therapy. The condition of the first boy, who developed a pancreatic tail pseudocyst and splenic infarction, was especially complicated. The boy underwent 2 endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies and stenting, along with a surgical procedure that completely relieved his symptoms for 3 months. The 3 patients and their parents were given genetic testing. All of the patients carried 1 or more gene mutations inherited from their mothers, fathers, or both parents; however, none of the parents were affected.|For children with repeated pancreatitis, clinicians should consider HP in the differential diagnosis. It is reliable to perform gene sequencing on suspicious patients and their parents. Multidisciplinary and comprehensive treatment should be recommended to manage HP and its complications. Cholangiopancreatography and stenting is a relatively minimally invasive approach when compared with surgery and can be tried as an early intervention. Surgical procedures should be reserved for patients with complications.",nonCancer
2116,"Colloidal quantum-dot-based silica gel glass: two-photon absorption, emission, and quenching mechanism.","Two-photon (TP) three-dimensional solid matrices have potential applications in high density optical data reading and storage, infrared-pumped visible displays, lasers, etc. Such technologies will benefit greatly from the advantageous properties of TP materials including tunable emission wavelength, photostability, and simple chemical processing. Here, this ideal TP solid is made possible by using a facile sol-gel process to engineer colloid quantum dots into silica gel glass. Characterization using an open-aperture Z-scan technique shows that the solid matrices exhibited significant TP optical properties with a TP absorption coefficient of (9.41 ± 0.39) × 10(-2) cm GW(-1) and a third-order nonlinear figure of merit of (7.30 ± 0.30) × 10(-14) esu cm. In addition, the dependence of the TP properties on high-temperature thermal treatment is studied in detail to obtain a clear insight for practical applications. The results illustrate that the sample can maintain stable TP performance below the synthesis temperature of the CdTe/CdS colloidal quantum dots. Furthermore, the mechanisms for thermal quenching of photoluminescence under different temperature regimes are clarified as a function of the composition.",nonCancer
573,Expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha as a biomarker of outcome in soft-tissue sarcomas.,"Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha is a transcription factor that supports the adaptation of human cancer cells to hypoxia and tumor growth and progression. The overexpression of HIF-1alpha protein has been reported to be associated with a worse prognosis in various cancers. However, the expression of HIF-1alpha in soft-tissue sarcomas has not yet been characterized. The expression of HIF-1alpha protein was immunohistochemically determined in 49 specimens of soft-tissue sarcomas including malignant fibrous histiocytoma (29 patients), synovial sarcoma (12 patients), leiomyosarcoma (four patients), and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (four patients). The 49 samples consisted of 40 primary lesions and nine local recurrences. An immunohistochemical analysis showed the nuclear accumulation of HIF-1alpha protein in 35 (71.4%) samples. The expression of HIF-1alpha was negative in 14 (28.6%) cases, weak in nine (18.4%), moderate in 17 (35.4%), and strong in nine (18.4%). The patients with a strong or moderate expression of HIF-1alpha had a significantly shorter overall survival rate in comparison with those with a weak or negative expression in a univariate analysis (P = 0.029; log-rank test) and multivariate analysis (P = 0.018). This is the first report that demonstrated an overexpression of HIF-1alpha protein to be an independent prognostic factor for soft-tissue sarcomas.",cancer

216,Prognostic implications of CEBPA mutations in pediatric acute myeloid leukemia: a report from the Japanese Pediatric Leukemia/Lymphoma Study Group.,"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) mutations are a favorable prognostic factor in adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients; however, few studies have examined their significance in pediatric AML patients. Here we examined the CEBPA mutation status and clinical outcomes of pediatric AML patients treated in the AML-05 study. We found that 47 (14.9%) of the 315 evaluable patients harbored mutations in CEBPA; 26 cases (8.3%) harbored a single mutation (CEBPA-single) and 21 (6.7%) harbored double or triple mutations (CEBPA-double). After excluding core-binding factor-AML cases, patients harboring CEBPA mutations showed better overall survival (OS; P=0.048), but not event-free survival (EFS; P=0.051), than wild-type patients. Multivariate analysis identified CEBPA-single and CEBPA-double as independent favorable prognostic factors for EFS in the total cohort (hazard ratio (HR): 0.47 and 0.33; P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). CEBPA-double was also an independent favorable prognostic factor for OS (HR: 0.30; P=0.04). CEBPA-double remained an independent favorable factor for EFS (HR: 0.28; P=0.04) in the normal karyotype cohort. These results suggest that CEBPA mutations, particularly CEBPA-double, are an independent favorable prognostic factor in pediatric AML patients, which will have important implications for risk-stratified therapy.",cancer

1872,Psychometric Properties of the Pain Numeric Rating Scale When Applied to Multiple Body Regions among Professional Musicians.,"Despite the broad popularity of a numeric rating scale (NRS) its psychometric properties are not well known. The objective was to determine if there is any difference in the discrimination ability of the NRS when used for measuring pain severity separately in different body regions.|Cross-sectional survey study of 630 professional musicians. Item Response Theory (IRT) was used to define the psychometric properties of the NRS.|The discrimination ability of the pain NRS was dependent on the body area to which it was applied. The discrimination was low 0.5 (95% CI 0.4. to 0.7) for the hand region and perfect for the shoulder and upper part of the neck- 3.2 (95% CI 1.2 to 5.2) and 10.5 (95% CI 10.0 to 10.9), respectively. Both shoulder and neck NRSs showed a great shift towards higher levels of pain severity meaning that the ability of the NRS to discriminate low levels of pain is poor. NRS scores obtained from all other regions did not demonstrate any discrimination ability.|The pain NRS might have different psychometric properties depending on the body area to which it is applied. Overall, the modest discrimination ability of the pain NRS implies that it should be used in screening questionnaires with some reservations.",nonCancer
651,Biomarkers of evasive resistance predict disease progression in cancer patients treated with antiangiogenic therapies.,"Numerous antiangiogenic agents are approved for the treatment of oncological diseases. However, almost all patients develop evasive resistance mechanisms against antiangiogenic therapies. Currently no predictive biomarker for therapy resistance or response has been established. Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify biomarkers predicting the development of therapy resistance in patients with hepatocellular cancer (n = 11), renal cell cancer (n = 7) and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 2). Thereby we measured levels of angiogenic growth factors, tumor perfusion, circulating endothelial cells (CEC), circulating endothelial progenitor cells (CEP) and tumor endothelial markers (TEM) in patients during the course of therapy with antiangiogenic agents, and correlated them with the time to antiangiogenic progression (aTTP). Importantly, at disease progression, we observed an increase of proangiogenic factors, upregulation of CEC/CEP levels and downregulation of TEMs, such as Robo4 and endothelial cell-specific chemotaxis regulator (ECSCR), reflecting the formation of torturous tumor vessels. Increased TEM expression levels tended to correlate with prolonged aTTP (ECSCR high = 275 days vs. ECSCR low = 92.5 days; p = 0.07 and for Robo4 high = 387 days vs. Robo4 low = 90.0 days; p = 0.08). This indicates that loss of vascular stabilization factors aggravates the development of antiangiogenic resistance. Thus, our observations confirm that CEP/CEC populations, proangiogenic cytokines and TEMs contribute to evasive resistance in antiangiogenic treated patients. Higher TEM expression during disease progression may have clinical and pathophysiological implications, however, validation of our results is warranted for further biomarker development.",cancer
1682,MicroRNA-9 regulates the development of knee osteoarthritis through the NF-kappaB1 pathway in chondrocytes.,"It has been suggested that microRNA-9 (miR-9) is associated with the development of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This study was aimed to investigate the association between the mechanism of miR-9 targeting nuclear factor kappa-B1 (NF-κB1) and the proliferation and apoptosis of knee OA chondrocytes.Cartilage samples were collected from 25 patients with knee OA and 10 traumatic amputees, and another 15 OA rat models, together with 15 rats without knee OA lesions were also established. MiR-9 expressions in both knee OA cartilage and normal cartilage samples were detected using quantitative real-time PCR. The expressions of related genes (NF-κB1, IL-6, and MMP-13) in the two groups were also detected. Dual luciferase reporter gene assay was employed to examine the effect of miR-9 on the luciferase activity of NF-κB1 3'UTR. Knee OA chondrocytes were transfected with miR-9 mimics, miR-9 inhibitor, and NF-κB1 siRNA, respectively, and changes in cellular proliferation and apoptosis were detected via MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Western blotting assay was used to detect the expressions of NF-κB1, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13).According to results from human OA samples and rat OA models, miR-9 was significantly downregulated in knee OA cartilage tissues compared with normal cartilage tissues (P < 0.01). The expressions of NF-κB1, IL-6, and MMP-13 in knee OA cartilage tissues were significantly higher than those in normal cartilage tissues (P < 0.01). Dual luciferase reporter gene assay showed that miR-9 could bind to the 3'UTR of NF-κB1 and significantly inhibit the luciferase activity by 37% (P < 0.01). Upregulation of miR-9 or downregulation of NF-κB1 could promote cell proliferation and suppress cell apoptosis.Conclusively, downregulated miR-9 can facilitate proliferation and antiapoptosis of knee OA chondrocytes by directly binding to NF-kB1, implying that stimulating miR-9 expressions might assist in treatment of knee OA.",nonCancer
2472,Distinctive pattern of let-7 family microRNAs in aggressive carcinoma of the oral tongue in young patients.,"Oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma may be more aggressive at presentation and recurrence in young patients compared with older patients. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) has been associated with the development and prognosis of oral cavity cancer. The present study investigated miRNA expression in carcinoma of the oral tongue in young patients. miRNA expression profiles were evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples of tumor and normal mucosa from 12 patients aged <30 years old with squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue. The levels of let-7f-5p, miR-30b-5p and let-7e-5p were upregulated in tumors (P<0.05). The expression of let-7f-5p was upregulated in non-aggressive tumors, while the expression of let-7e-5p was upregulated in aggressive tumors, compared with the corresponding normal tissue. Aggressive tumors had higher levels of let-7c, miR-130a-3p, miR-361-5p, miR-99a-5p, miR-29c-3p and let-7d-5p than non-aggressive tumors (P<0.05). The findings remained significant for let-7c upon false-discovery rate correction. An excellent correlation was noticed on validation of NanoString counts by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The comparison with published findings in adults demonstrated a unique miRNA signature in young patients with aggressive disease. Aggressive oral cavity cancer in patients <30 years old is associated with a distinctive expression pattern of the let-7 family. Larger studies including direct comparison with older patients are warranted.",nonCancer
1101,Prediction and prioritization of rare oncogenic mutations in the cancer Kinome using novel features and multiple classifiers.,"Cancer is a genetic disease that develops through a series of somatic mutations, a subset of which drive cancer progression. Although cancer genome sequencing studies are beginning to reveal the mutational patterns of genes in various cancers, identifying the small subset of ""causative"" mutations from the large subset of ""non-causative"" mutations, which accumulate as a consequence of the disease, is a challenge. In this article, we present an effective machine learning approach for identifying cancer-associated mutations in human protein kinases, a class of signaling proteins known to be frequently mutated in human cancers. We evaluate the performance of 11 well known supervised learners and show that a multiple-classifier approach, which combines the performances of individual learners, significantly improves the classification of known cancer-associated mutations. We introduce several novel features related specifically to structural and functional characteristics of protein kinases and find that the level of conservation of the mutated residue at specific evolutionary depths is an important predictor of oncogenic effect. We consolidate the novel features and the multiple-classifier approach to prioritize and experimentally test a set of rare unconfirmed mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (EGFR). Our studies identify T725M and L861R as rare cancer-associated mutations inasmuch as these mutations increase EGFR activity in the absence of the activating EGF ligand in cell-based assays.",cancer

1382,Glutathione in the treatment of liver diseases: insights from clinical practice.,"Liver diseases markedly contribute to the global burden of mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of alcohol and non-alcohol induced liver diseases is complex and many factors have been described to contribute to the progressive loss of liver functions, including the over- generation of reactive oxygen species. The tripeptide glutathione (GSH) is the most important low molecular weight antioxidant synthesized in cells. In fact, GSH is a reducing molecule and it can react with oxygen species by neutralizing the unpaired electrons that make them highly reactive and dangerous. ROS over- production impairs the intracellular GSH homeostasis, leading to GSH deficiency, a pathophysiological hallmark in alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases. On the basis of evidence obtained from experimental research and previous clinical studies, GSH administration appears a promising strategy to recover oxidative stress-induced liver damages in alcoholic and non-alcoholic liver diseases.",nonCancer

Clinical parameters such as recession depth, recession width, clinical attachment level, probing depth, and width of keratinized tissue were measured at the baseline and 6 months post-surgery. A mucosal double papillary flap was elevated and the respective root was thoroughly planed. The connective tissue graft was harvested from the palate, and then adapted over the root. The pedicle flap was secured over the connective tissue graft and sutured. The surgical technique was similar in the control group except for the prepared double pedicle graft which was full thickness.|The mean root coverage was 88.14% (2.83 mm) in the test group and 85.7% (2.75 mm) in the control group. No statistical differences were found in the mean reduction of vertical recession, width of recession, or probing depth between the test and control groups.

20,The neuroblastoma-associated F1174L ALK mutation causes resistance to an ALK kinase inhibitor in ALK-translocated cancers.,"The ALK kinase inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066) is clinically effective in patients with ALK-translocated cancers, but its efficacy will ultimately be limited by acquired drug resistance. Here we report the identification of a secondary mutation in ALK, F1174L, as one cause of crizotinib resistance in a patient with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) harboring a RANBP2-ALK translocation who progressed while on crizotinib therapy. When present in cis with an ALK translocation, this mutation (also detected in neuroblastomas) causes an increase in ALK phosphorylation, cell growth, and downstream signaling. Furthermore, the F1174L mutation inhibits crizotinib-mediated downregulation of ALK signaling and blocks apoptosis in RANBP2-ALK Ba/F3 cells. A chemically distinct ALK inhibitor, TAE684, and the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG are both effective in models harboring the F1174L ALK mutation. Our findings highlight the importance of studying drug resistance mechanisms in order to develop effective clinical treatments for patients with ALK-translocated cancers.",cancer

In this study, the authors tested the prognostic significance and clinicopathologic correlations of v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-ras) oncogene homolog (NRAS) mutations in patients with metastatic melanoma. Clinical and pathologic data were collected retrospectively on melanoma patients who were clinically tested for BRAF (exon 15) and NRAS (exons 1 and 2) mutations at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. Analyses were performed to identify significant associations of mutations with tumor and patient characteristics and with survival from the diagnosis of stage IV disease. The genotypes of the full cohort (n = 677) were 47% BRAF mutation, 20% NRAS mutation, and 32% wild-type for BRAF and NRAS (""WT""). Tumor mutation status was associated (P = .008) with the risk of central nervous system involvement at the diagnosis of stage IV disease, with a higher prevalence observed in BRAF-mutant (24%) and NRAS-mutant (23%) patients than in WT patients (12%). Among patients with nonuveal melanoma who underwent mutation testing within 6 months of stage IV diagnosis (n = 313), patients with NRAS mutations had a median survival of 8.2 months from stage IV diagnosis, which was shorter than the median survival of WT patients (15.1 months; P = .004). Multivariate analysis of this population incorporating age, sex, metastases (M1) category, serum lactate dehydrogenase level, and mutation status confirmed that NRAS mutations are associated independently with decreased overall survival (vs WT; P = .005; hazard ratio, 2.05). Patients with BRAF or NRAS mutations were more likely than WT patients to have central nervous system involvement at the time they were diagnosed with distant metastatic disease. NRAS mutation status was identified as an independent predictor of shorter survival after a diagnosis of stage IV melanoma.",cancer

Concealed carry laws allow licensed individuals to carry concealed weapons.|A comprehensive review of the literature was performed. We used GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology to assess the breadth and quality of the data specific to our PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, Outcomes) questions.|A total of 4673 studies were initially identified, then seven more added after two subsequent, additional literature reviews. Of these, 3623 remained after removing duplicates; 225 case reports, case series, and reviews were excluded, and 3379 studies were removed because they did not focus on prevention or did not address our comparators of interest. This left a total of 14 studies which merited inclusion for PICO 1 and 13 studies which merited inclusion for PICO 2.|PICO 1: We recommend the use of restrictive licensing to reduce firearm-related injuries.PICO 2: We recommend against the use of concealed carry laws to reduce firearm-related injuries.This committee found an association between more restrictive licensing and lower firearm injury rates. All 14 studies were population-based, longitudinal, used modeling to control for covariates, and 11 of the 14 were multi-state. Twelve of the studies reported reductions in firearm injuries, from 7-40%. We found no consistent effect of concealed carry laws.

1647,Overall and cause-specific excess mortality in HIV-positive persons compared with the general population: Role of HCV coinfection.,"We aimed to estimate overall and cause-specific excess mortality of HIV-positive patients compared with the general population, and to assess the effect of risk factors.We included patients aged >19 years, recruited from January 1, 2004 to May 31, 2014 in Cohort of the Spanish Network on HIV/AIDS Research. We used generalized linear models with Poisson error structure to model excess mortality rates.In 10,340 patients, 368 deaths occurred. Excess mortality was 0.82 deaths per 100 person-years for all-cause mortality, 0.11 for liver, 0.08 for non-AIDS-defining malignancies (NADMs), 0.08 for non-AIDS infections, and 0.02 for cardiovascular-related causes. Lower CD4 count and higher HIV viral load, lower education, being male, and over 50 years were predictors of overall excess mortality. Short-term (first year follow-up) overall excess hazard ratio (eHR) for subjects with AIDS at entry was 3.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.66, 5.19) and 1.37 (95% CI 0.87, 2.15) for hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected; medium/long-term eHR for AIDS at entry was 0.90 (95% CI 0.58, 1.39) and 3.83 (95% CI 2.37, 6.19) for HCV coinfection. Liver excess mortality was associated with low CD4 counts and HCV coinfection. Patients aged ≥50 years and HCV-coinfected showed higher NADM excess mortality, and HCV-coinfected patients showed increased non-AIDS infections excess mortality.Overall, liver, NADM, non-AIDS infections, and cardiovascular excesses of mortality associated with being HIV-positive were found, and HCV coinfection and immunodeficiency played significant roles. Differential short and medium/long-term effects of AIDS at entry and HCV coinfection were found for overall excess mortality.",nonCancer
1116,The T393C polymorphism in the gene GNAS1 of G protein is associated with survival of patients with invasive breast carcinoma.,"The GNAS1 locus encodes the G(alpha)s protein which stimulates the formation of cyclic AMP (cAMP). Subsequently the cAMP pathway mediates various pleiotropic effects including regulation of apoptosis and proliferation. We have recently shown that genotypes of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) T393C in the gene GNAS1 are associated with survival of patients suffering from bladder, renal cell and colorectal carcinoma. In the present study, the genotypes of the T393C SNP were determined in 279 patients with invasive breast carcinoma. Comparing the genotypes with the overall survival as well as important clinico-pathological parameters showed that carriers of the T allele had a significantly less favourable course of the disease when compared to carriers of the homozygous CC genotype. In multivariate analysis the homozygous TT genotype was independently associated with a decreased overall survival. Our results suggest that the GNAS1 T393C SNP is a novel genetic host factor for disease progression in patients with invasive breast carcinoma.",cancer
1446,Differential Impact of Unilateral and Bilateral Classifications of Diabetic Retinopathy and Diabetic Macular Edema on Vision-Related Quality of Life.,"To evaluate and compare the impact of unilateral better-eye and bilateral categorizations of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular edema (DME) on vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM).|We recruited 390 subjects (116 females; age range, 22-78 years) of Malay, Indian, and Chinese ethnicities from the Singapore Diabetes Management Project (S-DMP), a cross-sectional clinic-based study conducted from 2010 to 2013. Diabetic retinopathy and DME were graded using the Modified Airlie House and American Academy of Ophthalmology classification systems, respectively. Subjects were categorized, using unilateral better-eye classifications, into no DR (n = 189), any DR only (n = 164), and any DME (n = 37); and with bilateral classifications into no DR (n = 144), DR/DME in one eye only (n = 45), DR in one eye and DR/DME in the other (n = 164), and DME in both eyes (n = 37). Vision-related quality of life was assessed using the composite Rasch-transformed score of the Impact of Visual Impairment (IVI) questionnaire.|For unilateral better-eye classifications, multivariable linear models revealed a 9% reduction in VRQoL for any DR (β [95% confidence interval (CI)], -0.44 [-0.86, -0.03]) and a 17% reduction for any DME (-0.81 [-1.53, -0.08]) compared to individuals with no DR/DME. Bilateral categorizations revealed significant decrements in VRQoL that occurred only when both eyes had either DR or DME (11%), which worsened when both eyes were affected by DME (22%).|Our results suggest that interventions to prevent the onset of DR and/or DME in the second eye are strongly recommended to significantly reduce the bilateral impact of these conditions on VRQoL.",nonCancer
1740,Internalization of Auger electron-emitting isotopes into cancer cells: A method for spatial distribution determination of equivalent source terms.,"A challenge for single cell dosimetry of internalised Auger electron-emitting (AE) radiopharmaceuticals remains how best to elucidate their spatial distribution. To this end, a method, photoresist autoradiography (PAR), was previously developed to identify the lateral spatial distribution of AE emitting radionuclides internalized in single cancer cells. In this report, we present a simple mathematical model based on the radius and depth of radiation-induced patterns in photoresist material to identify the location in the z-plane of an (111)In source capable of generating the pattern.|SQ20B cells, derived from a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, were exposed to (111)In-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) (8 MBq/µg). The integrated electron fluence after 4 half-lives from the internalized radionuclide-containing construct was detected by a photoresist layer that was placed in close proximity to the cells. The resultant latent patterns were chemically developed and analysed by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The features in the patterns were matched to locations of electrons emitted from simulated point sources, thereby determining the likely locations of internalized radionuclides.|The modeling procedure was validated using simple patterns. The model relates the depth and radius (in the x-y plane) of a pattern to the location and fluence of the source giving rise to the pattern. This point source modeling method provided a good fit to experimental data and can be expanded to analyze more complex patterns.|We have demonstrated the utility of the modelling technique to identify the location of internalized AE-emitting radionuclides. This methodology now needs to be extended to predict the source positions in more complex PAR patterns.",nonCancer
6,NRAS and BRAF mutations in melanoma-associated nevi and uninvolved nevi.,"According to the prevailing multistep model of melanoma development, oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutations are crucial initial events in melanoma development. It is not known whether melanocytic nevi that are found in association with a melanoma are more likely to carry BRAF or NRAS mutations than uninvolved nevi. By laser microdissection we were able to selectively dissect and genotype cells either from the nevus or from the melanoma part of 46 melanomas that developed in association with a nevus. In 25 cases we also genotyped a control nevus of the same patients. Available tissue was also immunostained using the BRAF(V600E)-mutation specific antibody VE1. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 63.0% of melanomas, 65.2% of associated nevi and 50.0% of control nevi. No significant differences in the distribution of BRAF or NRAS mutations could be found between melanoma and associated nevi or between melanoma associated nevi and control nevi. In concordant cases immunohistochemistry showed a higher expression (intensity of immunohistochemistry) of the mutated BRAF(V600E)-protein in melanomas compared to their associated nevi. In this series the presence of a BRAF- or NRAS mutation in a nevus was not associated with the risk of malignant transformation. Our findings do not support the current traditional model of stepwise tumor progression.",cancer
2103,Detecting and representing predictable structure during auditory scene analysis.,"We use psychophysics and MEG to test how sensitivity to input statistics facilitates auditory-scene-analysis (ASA). Human subjects listened to 'scenes' comprised of concurrent tone-pip streams (sources). On occasional trials a new source appeared partway. Listeners were more accurate and quicker to detect source appearance in scenes comprised of temporally-regular (REG), rather than random (RAND), sources. MEG in passive listeners and those actively detecting appearance events revealed increased sustained activity in auditory and parietal cortex in REG relative to RAND scenes, emerging ~400 ms of scene-onset. Over and above this, appearance in REG scenes was associated with increased responses relative to RAND scenes. The effect of temporal structure on appearance-evoked responses was delayed when listeners were focused on the scenes relative to when listening passively, consistent with the notion that attention reduces 'surprise'. Overall, the results implicate a mechanism that tracks predictability of multiple concurrent sources to facilitate active and passive ASA.",nonCancer
1492,Aedes albopictus and Its Environmental Limits in Europe.,"The Asian tiger mosquito Aedes albopictus, native to South East Asia, is listed as one of the worst invasive vector species worldwide. In Europe the species is currently restricted to Southern Europe, but due to the ongoing climate change, Ae. albopictus is expected to expand its potential range further northwards. In addition to modelling the habitat suitability for Ae. albopictus under current and future climatic conditions in Europe by means of the maximum entropy approach, we here focused on the drivers of the habitat suitability prediction. We explored the most limiting factors for Aedes albopictus in Europe under current and future climatic conditions, a method which has been neglected in species distribution modelling so far. Ae. albopictus is one of the best-studied mosquito species, which allowed us to evaluate the applied Maxent approach for most limiting factor mapping. We identified three key limiting factors for Ae. albopictus in Europe under current climatic conditions: winter temperature in Eastern Europe, summer temperature in Southern Europe. Model findings were in good accordance with commonly known establishment thresholds in Europe based on climate chamber experiments and derived from the geographical distribution of the species. Under future climatic conditions low winter temperature were modelled to remain the most limiting factor in Eastern Europe, whereas in Central Europe annual mean temperature and summer temperatures were modelled to be replaced by summer precipitation, respectively, as most limiting factors. Changes in the climatic conditions in terms of the identified key limiting factors will be of great relevance regarding the invasive potential of the Ae. albopictus. Thus, our results may help to understand the key drivers of the suggested range expansion under climate change and may help to improve monitoring programmes. The applied approach of investigating limiting factors has proven to yield valuable results and may also provide valuable insights into the drivers of the prediction of current and future distribution of other species. This might be particularly interesting for other vector species that are of increasing public health concerns.",nonCancer
1180,"BIBW2992, an irreversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitor highly effective in preclinical lung cancer models.","Genetic alterations in the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are associated with sensitivity to treatment with small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Although first-generation reversible, ATP-competitive inhibitors showed encouraging clinical responses in lung adenocarcinoma tumors harboring such EGFR mutations, almost all patients developed resistance to these inhibitors over time. Such resistance to first-generation EGFR inhibitors was frequently linked to an acquired T790M point mutation in the kinase domain of EGFR, or upregulation of signaling pathways downstream of HER3. Overcoming these mechanisms of resistance, as well as primary resistance to reversible EGFR inhibitors driven by a subset of EGFR mutations, will be necessary for development of an effective targeted therapy regimen. Here, we show that BIBW2992, an anilino-quinazoline designed to irreversibly bind EGFR and HER2, potently suppresses the kinase activity of wild-type and activated EGFR and HER2 mutants, including erlotinib-resistant isoforms. Consistent with this activity, BIBW2992 suppresses transformation in isogenic cell-based assays, inhibits survival of cancer cell lines and induces tumor regression in xenograft and transgenic lung cancer models, with superior activity over erlotinib. These findings encourage further testing of BIBW2992 in lung cancer patients harboring EGFR or HER2 oncogenes.",cancer
21,"Activity of dasatinib against L576P KIT mutant melanoma: molecular, cellular, and clinical correlates.","Point mutations in the KIT receptor tyrosine kinase gene have recently been identified in mucosal, acral lentiginous, and chronically sun-damaged melanomas. We have identified the first human melanoma cell line with an endogenous L576P mutation, the most common KIT mutation in melanoma ( approximately 30-40%). In vitro testing showed that the cell viability of the L576P mutant cell line was not reduced by imatinib, nilotinib, or sorafenib small molecule KIT inhibitors effective in nonmelanoma cells with other KIT mutations. However, the viability of the mutant cells was reduced by dasatinib at concentrations as low as 10 nM (P = 0.004). Molecular modeling studies found that the L576P mutation induces structural changes in KIT that reduce the affinity for imatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = -2.52 kcal/mol) but not for dasatinib (DeltaDeltaGbind = +0.32 kcal/mol). Two metastatic melanoma patients with the L576P KIT mutation were treated with dasatinib, including one patient previously treated with imatinib. Both patients had marked reduction (>50%) and elimination of tumor F18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avidity by positron emission tomography (PET) imaging after dasatinib treatment. These data support the selective inhibitory effect of dasatinib against cells harboring the most common KIT mutation in melanoma, and thus has therapeutic implications for acrallentiginous, chronic sun-damaged, and mucosal melanomas.",cancer

Crizotinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), ROS1, and another proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase, MET. We enrolled 50 patients with advanced NSCLC who tested positive for ROS1 rearrangement in an expansion cohort of the phase 1 study of crizotinib. Patients were treated with crizotinib at the standard oral dose of 250 mg twice daily and assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, and response to therapy. ROS1 fusion partners were identified with the use of next-generation sequencing or reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays. The objective response rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 58 to 84), with 3 complete responses and 33 partial responses. The median duration of response was 17.6 months (95% CI, 14.5 to not reached). Median progression-free survival was 19.2 months (95% CI, 14.4 to not reached), with 25 patients (50%) still in follow-up for progression. Among 30 tumors that were tested, we identified 7 ROS1 fusion partners: 5 known and 2 novel partner genes. No correlation was observed between the type of ROS1 rearrangement and the clinical response to crizotinib. The safety profile of crizotinib was similar to that seen in patients with ALK-rearranged NSCLC. In this study, crizotinib showed marked antitumor activity in patients with advanced ROS1-rearranged NSCLC. ROS1 rearrangement defines a second molecular subgroup of NSCLC for which crizotinib is highly active. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00585195.).",cancer
633,Recurrent DNMT3A mutations in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.,"Alterations in DNA methylation have been implicated in the pathogenesis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), although the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Methylation of CpG dinucleotides is mediated by DNA methyltransferases, including DNMT1, DNMT3A and DNMT3B. DNMT3A mutations have recently been reported in patients with de novo acute myeloid leukemia (AML), providing a rationale for examining the status of DNMT3A in MDS samples. In this study, we report the frequency of DNMT3A mutations in patients with de novo MDS, and their association with secondary AML. We sequenced all coding exons of DNMT3A using DNA from bone marrow and paired normal cells from 150 patients with MDS and identified 13 heterozygous mutations with predicted translational consequences in 12/150 patients (8.0%). Amino acid R882, located in the methyltransferase domain of DNMT3A, was the most common mutation site, accounting for 4/13 mutations. DNMT3A mutations were expressed in the majority of cells in all tested mutant samples regardless of myeloblast counts, suggesting that DNMT3A mutations occur early in the course of MDS. Patients with DNMT3A mutations had worse overall survival compared with patients without DNMT3A mutations (P=0.005) and more rapid progression to AML (P=0.007), suggesting that DNMT3A mutation status may have prognostic value in de novo MDS.",cancer
1496,A Translational Study of a New Therapeutic Approach for Acute Myocardial Infarction: Nanoparticle-Mediated Delivery of Pitavastatin into Reperfused Myocardium Reduces Ischemia-Reperfusion Injury in a Preclinical Porcine Model.,"There is an unmet need to develop an innovative cardioprotective modality for acute myocardial infarction, for which interventional reperfusion therapy is hampered by ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. We recently reported that bioabsorbable poly(lactic acid/glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle-mediated treatment with pitavastatin (pitavastatin-NP) exerts a cardioprotective effect in a rat IR injury model by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway and inhibiting inflammation. To obtain preclinical proof-of-concept evidence, in this study, we examined the effect of pitavastatin-NP on myocardial IR injury in conscious and anesthetized pig models.|Eighty-four Bama mini-pigs were surgically implanted with a pneumatic cuff occluder at the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and telemetry transmitters to continuously monitor electrocardiogram as well as to monitor arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The LCx was occluded for 60 minutes, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion under conscious conditions. Intravenous administration of pitavastatin-NP containing ≥ 8 mg/body of pitavastatin 5 minutes before reperfusion significantly reduced infarct size; by contrast, pitavastatin alone (8 mg/body) showed no therapeutic effects. Pitavastatin-NP produced anti-apoptotic effects on cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed 4 weeks after IR injury revealed that pitavastatin-NP reduced the extent of left ventricle remodeling. Importantly, pitavastatin-NP exerted no significant effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or serum biochemistry. Exploratory examinations in anesthetized pigs showed pharmacokinetic analysis and the effects of pitavastatin-NP on no-reflow phenomenon.|NP-mediated delivery of pitavastatin to IR-injured myocardium exerts cardioprotective effects on IR injury without apparent adverse side effects in a preclinical conscious pig model. Thus, pitavastatin-NP represents a novel therapeutic modality for IR injury in acute myocardial infarction.",nonCancer

We studied the VHL mutation status in a large population-based case group. Cases were identified within the Netherlands cohort study on diet and cancer, which includes 120,852 men and women. After 11.3 years of follow-up, 337 incident cases with histologically confirmed epithelial cancers were identified. DNA was isolated from paraffin material collected from 51 pathology laboratories and revised by one pathologist, leaving material from 235 cases. VHL mutational status was assessed by SSCP followed by direct sequencing, after testing SSCP as a screening tool in a subsample. The number of mutations was significantly higher for clear-cell RCC compared to other histological types. We observed 131 mutations in 114 out of 187 patients (61%) with clear-cell RCC. The majority of mutations were truncating mutations (47%). The mean tumor size was 72.7 mm for mutated tumors compared to 65.3 mm for wildtype tumors (p = 0.06). No statistically significant differences were observed for nuclear grade, TNM distribution or stage. In other histological types, we observed 8 mutations in 7 out of 48 patients (15%), 1 mutation in 1 of 6 oncocytoma, 3 mutations in 2 of 7 chromophobe RCC, 2 mutations in 2 of 30 papillary RCC, no mutations in 1 collecting duct carcinoma and 2 mutations in 2 of 4 unclassified RCC.

113,Genotypic and histological evolution of lung cancers acquiring resistance to EGFR inhibitors.,"Lung cancers harboring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) respond to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, but drug resistance invariably emerges. To elucidate mechanisms of acquired drug resistance, we performed systematic genetic and histological analyses of tumor biopsies from 37 patients with drug-resistant non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) carrying EGFR mutations. All drug-resistant tumors retained their original activating EGFR mutations, and some acquired known mechanisms of resistance including the EGFR T790M mutation or MET gene amplification. Some resistant cancers showed unexpected genetic changes including EGFR amplification and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, whereas others underwent a pronounced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Surprisingly, five resistant tumors (14%) transformed from NSCLC into small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and were sensitive to standard SCLC treatments. In three patients, serial biopsies revealed that genetic mechanisms of resistance were lost in the absence of the continued selective pressure of EGFR inhibitor treatment, and such cancers were sensitive to a second round of treatment with EGFR inhibitors. Collectively, these results deepen our understanding of resistance to EGFR inhibitors and underscore the importance of repeatedly assessing cancers throughout the course of the disease.",cancer

The first cohort (n = 32) received Mitomycin C (MMC)-based HIPEC intraperitoneally (35 mg/m² for 90 min) and the second cohort (n = 10) received a bi-directional therapy consisting of oxaliplatin (OX) (300 mg/m(2) for 30 min) intraperitoneally and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 400 mg/m² plus folinic acid 20 mg/m² intravenously. The following data were collected retrospectively: Age, sex, length of operation, length of hospital stay, amount of resection including extent of peritonectomy, peritoneal cancer index, CC (completeness of cytoreduction)-status and leukocyte-count before cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and HIPEC, on days 3, 7 and 14 after CRS and HIPEC. HIPEC leukopenia was defined as < 4000 cells/m³.|Leukopenia occurred statistically more often in the MMC than in the OX/5-FU-group (10/32 vs 0/10; P = 0.042). Leukopenia set-on was on day 7 after CRS and MMC-HIPEC and lasted for two to three days. Three patients (33%) required medical treatment. Patients affected by leukopenia were predominantly female (7/10 patients) and older than 50 years (8/10 patients). The length of hospital stay tended to be higher in the MMC-group without reaching statistical significance (22.5 ± 11 vs 16.5 ± 3.5 d). Length of operation (08:54 ± 01:44 vs 09:48 ± 02:28 h) were comparable between patients with and without postoperative leukopenia. Prior history of systemic chemotherapy did not trigger post-HIPEC leukopenia.

2005,Kinetic and Thermodynamic Characterization of Enhanced Carbon Dioxide Absorption Process with Lithium Oxide-Containing Ternary Molten Carbonate.,"Efficient and high-flux capture of CO2 is the prerequisite of its utilization. Static absorption of CO2 with solid Li2O and molten salts (Li2O-free and Li2O-containing Li-Na-K carbonates) was investigated using a reactor with in-situ pressure monitoring. The absorption capacity of dissolved Li2O was 0.835 molCO2/molLi2O at 723 K, larger than that of solid Li2O. For the solid Li2O absorbents, formation of solid Li2CO3 on the surface can retard the further reactions between Li2O and CO2, whereas the dissociation/dissolution effect of molten carbonate on Li2O improved the mass-specific absorption capacity of liquid Li2O. In Li2O-containing Li-Na-K molten carbonate, CO2 was mostly absorbed by alkaline oxide ions (O2-). The chemical interactions between CO2 and CO32- contributed to CO2 uptake via formation of multiple carbonate ions. The mass transfer of these absorbing ions was found as the dominating factor governing the rate of static absorption. Higher temperatures reduced the thermodynamic tendency of CO2 absorption, but a lower viscosity at elevated temperature was conducive to absorption kinetics. Compared with the commonly used CaO absorbent, Li2O was much more dissolvable in molten carbonate. The Li2O-containing molten carbonate is potentially a promising medium for industrial carbon capture and electrochemical transformation process.",nonCancer

A 31-year-old male was diagnosed with keratectasia 12 years after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). Following LASIK, the manifest refraction was -3.50-2.25×90 [0.1 logarithmic expression (LogMAR) best corrected visual acuity (BVCA)] in the right eye and -8.00-3.50×175 (0.3 LogMAR BCVA) in the left eye, with a LogMAR uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 0.8 and a 'counting fingers' value of 3 ft (CF @3 ft) in the left and right eyes, respectively. Riboflavin/ultraviolet A light (UVA) corneal crosslinking (CXL) was conducted on both eyes. Seven months after cross-linking, LogMAR UDVA was 0.4, the manifest refraction was -2.75-2.50×85 and LogMAR BCVA was 0.1 in the right eye. In the left eye, LogMAR UDVA was CF @3 ft, the manifest refraction was -15.00 and LogMAR BCVA was 0.3. The corneal topography was stable 7 months after CXL. Phakic toric ICL was implanted to correct the refractive error, following which the LogMAR UDVA improved to 0.1 in the right eye and 0.3 in left eye, and visual acuity remained stable for 6 months after ICL implantation. In conclusion, combining riboflavin/UVA corneal cross-linking and phakic toric ICL implantation may be an alternative in the correction of high refractive error in patients with keratectasia.",nonCancer

1474,Unexpected Changes in the Population of Coordination Isomers for the Lanthanide Ion Complexes of DOTMA-Tetraglycinate.,"Lanthanide complexes with DOTA-tetraglycinate (DOTA-(gly)4) heavily favor the square antiprismatic (SAP) coordination isomer in aqueous solution, a structural feature that has made them useful as water-based paraCEST agents. In an effort to create amide-based paraCEST agents with rapid water exchange rates, we prepared the analogous tetraglycinate complexes with DOTMA, a ligand known to favor the twisted square antiprismatic (TSAP) coordination structures. Unexpectedly, NMR investigations show that the LnDOTMA-(gly)4 complexes, like the LnDOTA-(gly)4 complexes, also favor the SAP isomers in solution. This observation led to density functional theory (DFT) calculations in order to identify the energy terms that favor the SAP structures in lanthanide complexes formed with macrocyclic DOTA- and DOTMA-tetraamide ligands. The DFT calculations revealed that, regardless the nature of the ligand, the TSAP isomers present more negative hydration energies than the SAP counterparts. The extent to which the TSAP isomer is stabilized varies, however, depending on the ligand structure, resulting in different isomeric populations in solution.",nonCancer

Genetically, Ewing sarcoma is defined by balanced chromosomal EWS/ETS translocations, which give rise to oncogenic chimeric proteins (EWS-ETS). Other contributing somatic mutations involved in disease development have only been observed at low frequency. Tumor samples of 116 Ewing sarcoma patients were analyzed here. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on two patients with normal, primary, and relapsed tissue. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 50 Ewing sarcoma and 22 matched normal tissues. A discovery dataset of 14 of these tumor/normal pairs identified 232 somatic mutations. Recurrent nonsynonymous mutations were validated in the 36 remaining exomes. Transcriptome analysis was performed in a subset of 14 of 50 Ewing sarcomas and DNA copy number gain and expression of FGFR1 in 63 of 116 Ewing sarcomas. Relapsed tumors consistently showed a 2- to 3-fold increased number of mutations. We identified several recurrently mutated genes at low frequency (ANKRD30A, CCDC19, KIAA0319, KIAA1522, LAMB4, SLFN11, STAG2, TP53, UNC80, ZNF98). An oncogenic fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) mutation (N546K) was detected, and the FGFR1 locus frequently showed copy number gain (31.7%) in primary tumors. Furthermore, high-level FGFR1 expression was noted as a characteristic feature of Ewing sarcoma. RNA interference of FGFR1 expression in Ewing sarcoma lines blocked proliferation and completely suppressed xenograft tumor growth. FGFR1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in a patient with Ewing sarcoma relapse significantly reduced 18-FDG-PET activity. FGFR1 may constitute a promising target for novel therapeutic approaches in Ewing sarcoma.",cancer
2007,"Biomechanics, energetics and coordination during extreme swimming intensity: effect of performance level.","The present study aimed to examine how high- and low-speed swimmers organise biomechanical, energetic and coordinative factors throughout extreme intensity swim. Sixteen swimmers (eight high- and eight low-speed) performed, in free condition, 100-m front crawl at maximal intensity and 25, 50 and 75-m bouts (at same pace as the previous 100-m), and 100-m maximal front crawl on the measuring active drag system (MAD-system). A 3D dual-media optoelectronic system was used to assess speed, stroke frequency, stroke length, propelling efficiency and index of coordination (IdC), with power assessed by MAD-system and energy cost by quantifying oxygen consumption plus blood lactate. Both groups presented a similar profile in speed, power output, stroke frequency, stroke length, propelling efficiency and energy cost along the effort, while a distinct coordination profile was observed (F(3, 42) = 3.59, P = 0.04). Speed, power, stroke frequency and propelling efficiency (not significant, only a tendency) were higher in high-speed swimmers, while stroke length and energy cost were similar between groups. Performing at extreme intensity led better level swimmers to achieve superior speed due to higher power and propelling efficiency, with consequent ability to swim at higher stroke frequencies. This imposes specific constraints, resulting in a distinct IdC magnitude and profile between groups.",nonCancer
123,Mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene identify a novel therapeutic target in squamous cell lung cancer.,"While genomically targeted therapies have improved outcomes for patients with lung adenocarcinoma, little is known about the genomic alterations which drive squamous cell lung cancer. Sanger sequencing of the tyrosine kinome identified mutations in the DDR2 kinase gene in 3.8% of squamous cell lung cancers and cell lines. Squamous lung cancer cell lines harboring DDR2 mutations were selectively killed by knock-down of DDR2 by RNAi or by treatment with the multi-targeted kinase inhibitor dasatinib. Tumors established from a DDR2 mutant cell line were sensitive to dasatinib in xenograft models. Expression of mutated DDR2 led to cellular transformation which was blocked by dasatinib. A squamous cell lung cancer patient with a response to dasatinib and erlotinib treatment harbored a DDR2 kinase domain mutation. These data suggest that gain-of-function mutations in DDR2 are important oncogenic events and are amenable to therapy with dasatinib. As dasatinib is already approved for use, these findings could be rapidly translated into clinical trials. DDR2 mutations are present in 4% of lung SCCs, and DDR2 mutations are associated with sensitivity to dasatinib. These findings provide a rationale for designing clinical trials with the FDA-approved drug dasatinib in patients with lung SCCs.",cancer
1844,Sensitivity of the GEPARD Patient Questionnaire to Identify Psoriatic Arthritis in Patients with Psoriasis in Daily Practice: The GEPARD-Life Study.,"Early detection of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) remains a challenge in clinical practice. Tools such as the German Psoriasis Arthritis Diagnostic (GEPARD) questionnaire have been developed for this purpose. The aim of this study was to determine the performance of the GEPARD questionnaire in the detection of PsA in psoriasis patients following rheumatology evaluation in daily clinical practice in Germany. This was a multicenter study involving 59 dermatology units (university/general hospital/office based), and the GEPARD questionnaire was distributed to psoriasis patients. Patients who had a sum score of ≥4 positive answers were referred to a rheumatologist for evaluation of PsA. We recruited 1,512 patients, of whom approximately 50% were referred. One third of the referred patients were classified as having PsA after rheumatological assessment. Rates of PsA in university/general hospital settings were higher than those observed in a doctor's office-based setting (43.7 vs. 25.8%). The GEPARD questionnaire demonstrated easy screening of psoriasis patients for PsA.",nonCancer
1205,Molecular basis of the constitutive activity and STI571 resistance of Asp816Val mutant KIT receptor tyrosine kinase.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase, KIT, displays activating mutations in the kinase domain, which are associated with various cancers. We have used homology modelling based on the crystal structures of the insulin receptor kinase in active and inactive conformations to predict the corresponding structures of the KIT kinase domain. We have prepared four KIT models, one each for the active and inactive conformations of the wild-type and of the Asp816Val mutant proteins. We have also placed ATP into the active conformations and the inhibitor, STI571, into the inactive conformations. All models have been fully energy minimised. The molecular modelling studies described here explain (i) why Asp816Val KIT is constitutively active, (ii) why the nature of the substituting amino acid at residue 816 is relatively unimportant, and (iii) why the Asp816Val substitution confers resistance to the KIT-inhibitory drug STI571. The models will be valuable for predicting other kinase inhibitory drugs that may be active on wild-type and mutant forms of KIT. During the course of this work, a crystal structure of the active conformation of the KIT kinase domain has been published. Our model of the active conformation of the Asp816Val mutant is strikingly similar to this crystal structure, whereas our model of the active conformation of the wild-type kinase domain of KIT differs from the crystal structure in some respects. The reasons for this apparent discrepancy are discussed.",cancer
1068,SMO mutation status defines a distinct and frequent molecular subgroup in olfactory groove meningiomas.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors in adults. Identification of SMO and AKT1 mutations in meningiomas has raised the hope for targeted therapies. It would be useful to know the precise frequency of these mutations in anatomical subgroups and clarify their prognostic value. We used the Sanger sequencing technique to characterize 79 samples of olfactory groove meningiomas for SMO (L412F and W535L) and AKT1E17K mutations. We reviewed clinical data to assess the prognostic value of these mutations in this anatomical subgroup. Out of the 79 patients with olfactory groove meningiomas, we identified targetable mutations in 34 patients (43%) (22 patients [28%] with SMO mutation-L412F almost exclusively-and 12 patients [15%] with AKT1 mutation). Meningiomas in the SMO-mutant group had an overall 36% recurrence rate, significantly higher than in the AKT1-mutant group (16%) and in the ""SMO and AKT1 wildtype"" group (11%) (χ2 test, P = .04). All late recurrences (after 5 y) occurred in the SMO-mutant group. Among grade I meningiomas, the SMO-mutant group was identified as having a significantly poorer prognosis. World Health Organization histological grade II (P = .006) and incomplete resection (P = .001) were independently associated with shorter recurrence-free survival. Molecular diagnosis of SMOL412F/W535L and AKT1E17K mutations improves prognostic evaluation in olfactory groove meningiomas and opens new therapeutic perspectives with SMO or AKT inhibitors for recurrent cases.",cancer
2143,A Depression Screening Protocol for Patients With Acute Stroke: A Quality Improvement Project.,"Depression after stroke is common and is associated with poor functional recovery, suicidal ideation, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Despite this knowledge, poststroke depression (PSD) is often underdetected and thus undertreated. PSD is clinically important for the caregiver, the family, and the stroke survivor. Inconsistencies in screening and treatment practices may further contribute to these negative outcomes.|The purposes of this evidence-based clinical scholarship project were to (1) determine the efficacy of an evidence-based depression screening protocol in improving early detection and treatment of PSD and (2) identify if there were any relationships between the protocol interventions, depression scores, and diagnosis.|A retrospective chart review was conducted in a convenience sample of 79 hospitalized patients with acute stroke. Depression was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Demographic data and medical and protocol variables were also collected. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and Pearson correlation test were used for data analysis.|Of the 79 participants, 56% were men, 65% were White, 77% were admitted with ischemic stroke, and 48% were identified as being depressed (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 depression scale > 4). Individuals with a history of depression (χ = 17.09, p = .002) were also more likely to have higher levels of depression severity as compared with patients who did not have a history of depression. After the intervention, patients screening positive were more likely to receive an educational booklet on stroke and depression (χ = 30.0, p = .000) and be medically treated for PSD before discharge (χ = 5.57, p = .018). Nurses' documentation of screening results also improved (χ = 9.19, p = .002).|Implementation of the Evidence Based Depression Screening and Treatment (EBDST) protocol improved early detection and treatment of PSD in the hospitalized patients with acute stroke before discharge. The EBDST protocol promoted systematic evidence-based depression screening in the hospitalized patients with acute stroke. Use of the EBDST protocol may further improve long-term health outcomes, decrease mortality, and improve functional recovery and quality of life.",nonCancer
293,Influence of GSTP1 I105V polymorphism on cumulative neuropathy and outcome of FOLFOX-4 treatment in Asian patients with colorectal carcinoma.,"Glutathione S-transferase P1 (GSTP1) participates in detoxification of potentially genotoxic compounds that may alter the efficacy and toxicity of platinum-based chemotherapy. We analyzed the influence of I105V polymorphism of GSTP1 on clinico-pathological features and outcomes in 166 Chinese patients with metastatic colorectal carcinoma who had been treated with first-line FOLFOX-4. Combined analysis of GSTP1 I105V, ERCC1-118, and XPD-751 polymorphisms was also conducted. The results showed that, in comparison with Caucasian populations, a remarkably lower prevalence of Val105 allele variants was noted (24.7%). Patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher response to FOLFOX-4 (56.1%vs 37.6%, P = 0.04), and a longer progression-free (P < 0.01) as well as overall (P < 0.01) survival. By adjusted analysis, this polymorphism was identified as an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.01). In combined analysis, patients without any risk genotype, including GSTP1-105 Ile/Ile, ERCC1-118 C/T or T/T, and XPD-751 Lys/Gln, had significantly longer progression-free and overall survivals (P < 0.01). In addition, patients with Val105 allele variants had a higher incidence of grade 3/4 cumulative neuropathy after different cycles of treatment. These data suggest that Asian populations have a lower prevalence of I105V polymorphism in GSTP1. I105V polymorphism in GSTP1, by reducing its enzymatic activity and consequential detoxification to oxaliplatin, could be a key determinant for a better outcome, but more neurotoxicity, to FOLFOX-4 treatment.",cancer
2135,"Comparing avocado, swamp bay, and camphortree as hosts of Raffaelea lauricola using a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled strain of the pathogen.","Raffaelea lauricola, a fungal symbiont of the ambrosia beetle Xyleborus glabratus, causes laurel wilt in members of the Lauraceae plant family. North American species in the family, such as avocado (Persea americana) and swamp bay (P. palustris), are particularly susceptible to laurel wilt, whereas the Asian camphortree (Cinnamomum camphora) is relatively tolerant. To determine whether susceptibility is related to pathogen colonization, a green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled strain of R. lauricola was generated and used to inoculate avocado, swamp bay, and camphortree. Trees were harvested 3, 10, and 30 days after inoculation (DAI), and disease severity was rated on a 1 to 10 scale. By 30 DAI, avocado and swamp bay developed significantly more severe disease than camphortree (mean severities of 6.8 and 5.5 vs. 1.6 p<0.003). The extent of xylem colonization was recorded as the percentage of lumena that were colonized by the pathogen. More xylem was colonized in avocado than camphortree (0.9% vs. 0.1%, p<0.03), but colonization in swamp bay (0.4%) did not differ significantly from either host. Although there were significant correlations between xylem colonization and laurel wilt severity in avocado (r=0.74), swamp bay (r=0.82), and camphortree (r=0.87), even severely affected trees were scarcely colonized by the pathogen.",nonCancer
1209,Epidermal growth factor receptor gene and protein and gefitinib sensitivity in non-small-cell lung cancer.,"Gefitinib is a selective inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is overexpressed in many cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We carried out a clinical study to compare the relationship between EGFR gene copy number, EGFR protein expression, EGFR mutations, and Akt activation status as predictive markers for gefitinib therapy in advanced NSCLC. Tumors from 102 NSCLC patients treated daily with 250 mg of gefitinib were evaluated for EGFR status by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), DNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry and for Akt activation status (phospho-Akt [P-Akt]) by immunohistochemistry. Time to progression, overall survival, and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated and evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier method; groups were compared using the log-rank test. Risk factors associated with survival were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling and multivariable analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. Amplification or high polysomy of the EGFR gene (seen in 33 of 102 patients) and high protein expression (seen in 58 of 98 patients) were statistically significantly associated with better response (36% versus 3%, mean difference = 34%, 95% CI = 16.6 to 50.3; P<.001), disease control rate (67% versus 26%, mean difference = 40.6%, 95% CI = 21.5 to 59.7; P<.001), time to progression (9.0 versus 2.5 months, mean difference = 6.5 months, 95% CI = 2.8 to 10.3; P<.001), and survival (18.7 versus 7.0 months, mean difference = 11.7 months, 95% CI = 2.1 to 21.4; P = .03). EGFR mutations (seen in 15 of 89 patients) were also statistically significantly related to response and time to progression, but the association with survival was not statistically significant, and 40% of the patients with mutation had progressive disease. In multivariable analysis, only high EGFR gene copy number remained statistically significantly associated with better survival (hazard ratio = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.23 to 0.82). Independent of EGFR assessment method, EGFR+/P-Akt+ patients had a statistically significantly better outcome than EGFR-, P-Akt-, or EGFR+/P-Akt- patients. High EGFR gene copy number identified by FISH may be an effective molecular predictor for gefitinib efficacy in advanced NSCLC.",cancer
539,Ibrutinib in previously treated Waldenström's macroglobulinemia.,"MYD88(L265P) and CXCR4(WHIM) mutations are highly prevalent in Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88(L265P) triggers tumor-cell growth through Bruton's tyrosine kinase, a target of ibrutinib. CXCR4(WHIM) mutations confer in vitro resistance to ibrutinib. We performed a prospective study of ibrutinib in 63 symptomatic patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia who had received at least one previous treatment, and we investigated the effect of MYD88 and CXCR4 mutations on outcomes. Ibrutinib at a daily dose of 420 mg was administered orally until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxic effects. After the patients received ibrutinib, median serum IgM levels decreased from 3520 mg per deciliter to 880 mg per deciliter, median hemoglobin levels increased from 10.5 g per deciliter to 13.8 g per deciliter, and bone marrow involvement decreased from 60% to 25% (P<0.01 for all comparisons). The median time to at least a minor response was 4 weeks. The overall response rate was 90.5%, and the major response rate was 73.0%; these rates were highest among patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WT) (with WT indicating wild-type) (100% overall response rate and 91.2% major response rate), followed by patients with MYD88(L265P)CXCR4(WHIM) (85.7% and 61.9%, respectively) and patients with MYD88(WT)CXCR4(WT) (71.4% and 28.6%). The estimated 2-year progression-free and overall survival rates among all patients were 69.1% and 95.2%, respectively. Treatment-related toxic effects of grade 2 or higher included neutropenia (in 22% of the patients) and thrombocytopenia (in 14%), which were more common in heavily pretreated patients; postprocedural bleeding (in 3%); epistaxis associated with the use of fish-oil supplements (in 3%); and atrial fibrillation associated with a history of arrhythmia (5%). Ibrutinib was highly active, associated with durable responses, and safe in pretreated patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia. MYD88 and CXCR4 mutation status affected responses to this drug.

2270,Development of Insulin Resistance through Induction of miRNA-135 in C2C12 Cells.,"Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are a class of posttranscriptional regulators that play crucial roles in various biological processes. Emerging evidence suggests a direct link between miRNAs and development of several diseases including type 2 diabetes (T2D). In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of predicted miRNA and target genes on insulin resistance.|This experimental study was conducted on the C2C12 cell line. Using bioinformatics tools miRNA-135 and two respective target genes-insulin receptor (Insr) and vesicle associated membrane protein 2 (Vamp2)were selected as potential factors involved in insulin resistance process. Levels of glucose uptake miRNA expression and respective gene targets were determined after cell transfaction by miR-135.|It was determined that Insr gene expression was significantly down-regulated in miR-135 transfected C2C12 cell line (P≤0.05). Interestingly; these transfected cells have shown a significant difference in glucose uptake incomparision the positive control cells, while it was similar to the insulin resistant cell line (P≤0.05). In contrast, no significant alteration of Vamp2 gene expression was observed.|Our data indicated no change on the Vamp2 expression level after miRNA transfection, while expression level of Insr was reduced and miR-135 expression was contrarily increased leading to poor stimulation of glucose uptake through insulin, and development of insulin resistance phenotype in C2C12 cell line.",nonCancer
96,Activating mutation of D835 within the activation loop of FLT3 in human hematologic malignancies.,"Mutations of receptor tyrosine kinases are implicated in the constitutive activation and development of human malignancy. An internal tandem duplication (ITD) of the juxtamembrane (JM) domain-coding sequence of the FLT3 gene (FLT3/ITD) is found in 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and is strongly associated with leukocytosis and a poor prognosis. On the other hand, mutations of the c-KIT gene, which have been found in mast cell leukemia and AML, are clustered in 2 distinct regions, the JM domain and D816 within the activation loop. This study was designed to analyze the mutation of D835 of FLT3, which corresponds to D816 of c-KIT, in a large series of human hematologic malignancies. Several kinds of missense mutations were found in 30 of the 429 (7.0%) AML cases, 1 of the 29 (3.4%) myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) cases, and 1 of the 36 (2.8%) acute lymphocytic leukemia patients. The D835Y mutation was most frequently found (22 of the 32 D835 mutations), followed by the D835V (5), and D835H (1), D835E (1), and D835N (1) mutations. Of note is that D835 mutations occurred independently of FLT3/ITD. An analysis in the 201 patients newly diagnosed with AML (excluding M3) revealed that, in contrast to the FLT3/ITD mutation (n = 46), D835 mutations (n = 8) were not significantly related to the leukocytosis, but tended to worsen disease-free survival. All D835-mutant FLT3 were constitutively tyrosine-phosphorylated and transformed 32D cells, suggesting these mutations were constitutively active. These results demonstrate that the FLT3 gene is the target most frequently mutated to become constitutively active in AML.",cancer
1522,Association between MDR1 gene polymorphisms and the risk of Crohn's Disease in a cohort of Algerian pediatric patients.,"BackgroundThe Multi-Drug Resistance gene (MDR1) has raised increasing interest as a susceptibility gene for Crohn's disease (CD). The role of MDR1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the predisposition and behavior of CD in the pediatric population is still elusive. Here, we investigated whether SNPs in MDR1 are associated with CD in Algerian pediatric patients.MethodsA case-control study was conducted enrolling 47 pediatric CD patients and 100 controls. All subjects were genotyped for the most common MDR1 SNPs (C3434T, C1236T, and G2677A/T) using PCR-RFLP method. We also explored the association between polymorphisms and clinical sub-phenotypes.ResultsWe have detected no significant association of C3435T SNP and pediatric CD. However, we observed a significantly higher frequency of the risk alleles, 1236T and 2677T/A among the CD patients compared to controls. Moreover, the risk allele 1236T was associated to a higher risk for resective surgery.ConclusionOur data suggests that the C1236T and G2677A/T SNPs in the MDR1 gene are associated with CD and the C1236T risk allele with a more severe course of disease in Algerian pediatric patients. Further analysis using larger patients group and functional studies would be interesting to elucidate the role of MDR1 gene in pediatric CD.Pediatric Research (2016); doi:10.1038/pr.2016.163.",nonCancer
693,The outcome and predictive factors of sunitinib therapy in advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) after imatinib failure - one institution study.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) mutational status is recognized factor related to the results of tyrosine kinase inhibitors therapy such as imatinib (IM) or sunitinib (SU). Arterial hypertension (AH) is common adverse event related to SU, reported as predictive factor in renal cell carcinoma. The aim of the study was to analyze the outcomes and factors predicting results of SU therapy in inoperable/metastatic CD117(+) GIST patients after IM failure. We identified 137 consecutive patients with advanced inoperable/metastatic GIST treated in one center with SU (2nd line treatment). Median follow-up time was 23 months. Additionally, in 39 patients there were analyzed selected constitutive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VEGFA and VEGFR2 genes. One year progression-free survival (PFS; calculated from the start of SU) rate was 42% and median PFS was 43 weeks. The estimated overall survival (OS, calculated both from start of SU or IM) was 74 weeks and 51 months, respectively. One-year PFS was 65% (median 74 weeks) in 55 patients with AH vs. 22% (median 17 weeks) in patients without AH. Patients with primary tumors carrying mutations in KIT exon 9 or wild-type had substantially better 1-year PFS (68% and 57%; median 65.5 and 50.5 weeks, respectively) than patients having tumors with KIT exon 11 or PDGFRA mutations (34% and 15%; median 36.8 and 9 weeks, respectively). We identified two independent factors with significant impact on PFS and OS in univariate and multivariate analysis: primary tumor genotype and presence of AH. The most common adverse events during therapy were: fatigue, AH, hypothyroidism, hand and foot syndrome, mucositis, skin reactions, dyspepsia, and diarrhea. Two deaths were assessed as related to tumor rupture caused by reaction to SU therapy. The presence of C-allele in rs833061 and the T-allele in rs3025039 polymorphism of VEGFA were associated with significantly higher risk of hypothyroidism (OR: 10.0 p = 0.041 and OR: 10.5; p = 0.015, respectively). We confirmed that many advanced GIST patients benefit from SU therapy with OS > 1.5 year. Primary tumor KIT/PDGFRA genotype and SU-induced AH, as surrogate of its antiangiogenic activity are two independent factors influencing both PFS and OS.",cancer

In addition, there are no reports that analyze overall survival and prognostic factors according to K-ras mutation status and subtypes in only unresectable pancreatic cancer (PC) determined from tissues obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. We retrospectively analyzed 242 patients who were diagnosed as having unresectable PC with available histological diagnosis. Clinical data collected included sex, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9, primary tumor location, stage (local or metastatic) according to TNM staging, first-line chemotherapy, K-ras mutation status and subtypes (G12D, G12V, and G12R), and overall survival. We analyzed the negative prognostic factors for reduced overall survival in unresectable PC patients using these data. From multivariate analysis, CA19-9 ≥1000 U/ml (hazard ratio [HR] 1.78, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.28-2.46, P < 0.01), metastatic stage (HR 2.26, 95 % CI 1.58-3.24, P < 0.01), and mutant-K-ras (HR 1.76, 95 % CI 1.03-3.01, P = 0.04) were negative prognostic factors, indicating a reduced survival. Among the patients who had K-ras mutation subtypes, CA19-9 ≥1000 U/ml (HR 1.65, 95 % CI 1.12-2.37, P < 0.01), metastatic stage (HR 2.12, 95 % CI 1.44-3.14, P < 0.01), and the presence of the G12D or G12R mutations (HR 1.60, 95 % CI 1.11-2.28) were negative prognostic factors for overall survival.

Unventilated mice either spontaneously breathed oxygen-rich gas (FIO2 = 0.4) for 2 or 8 hours or room air (n = 22). At the end of the experiment, lungs were inflated with a standardized volume of air after a lethal dose of pentobarbital was administered to the pups. All lungs were imaged with a prototype grating-based small-animal scanner to acquire x-ray transmission and dark-field radiographs. Image contrast between the air-filled pleural space and lung tissue was quantified for both transmission and dark-field radiograms. After the independent expert's assessment, 2 blinded readers evaluated all dark-field and transmission images for the presence or absence of pneumothoraces. Contrast ratios, diagnostic accuracy, as well as reader's confidence and interreader agreement were recorded for both imaging modalities.|Evaluation of both x-ray transmission and dark-field radiographs by independent experts revealed the development of a total of 10 pneumothoraces in 8 mice. Here, the contrast ratio between the air-filled pleural space of the pneumothoraces and the lung tissue was significantly higher in the dark field (8.4 ± 3.5) when compared with the transmission images (5.1 ± 2.8; P < 0.05). Accordingly, the readers' diagnostic confidence for the diagnosis of pneumothoraces was significantly higher for dark-field compared with transmission images (P = 0.001). Interreader agreement improved from moderate for the analysis of transmission images alone (κ = 0.41) to very good when analyzing dark-field images alone (κ = 0.90) or in combination with transmission images (κ = 0.88). Diagnostic accuracy significantly improved for the analysis of dark-field images alone (P = 0.04) or in combination with transmission images (P = 0.02), compared with the analysis of transmission radiographs only.|The significant improvement in contrast ratios between lung parenchyma and free air in the dark-field images allows the facilitated detection of pneumothoraces in the newborn mouse.

1,A great majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations represent gastric tumors of low or no malignant potential.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are KIT expressing spindle cell, epithelioid and rarely pleomorphic mesenchymal tumors. The majority of GISTs show gain-of-function KIT mutations. However, GISTs without KIT mutations and GISTs with weak or lack of immunohistochemical KIT expression have also been reported. Recently, gain-of-function mutations in exon 18 (activation loop) and exon 12 (juxtamembrane domain) of the PDGFRA were identified in such tumors. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that PDGFRA mutation may define a specific clinicopathologic subgroup of GISTs. A total of 447 KIT exon 11 (juxtamembrane domain) mutation-negative GISTs were studied. DNA samples were obtained from formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues. Genomic sequences of PDGFRA exons 18 and 12 were evaluated for the mutations by PCR amplification and direct sequencing. PDGFRA exon 18 mutations were identified in 122 of 346 (35.3%) gastric GISTs and two of 75 (2.7%) intestinal GISTs. A great majority of these mutations represented simple T to A missense mutation at the codon 842 leading to substitution of the valine for aspartic acid (D842 V). However, in-frame deletions and deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 841-847 were found in approximately 23% of all exon 18 mutations. Mutations in PDGFRA exon 12 were found only in 10 of 170 (5.8%) gastric and one of 54 (1.9%) intestinal GISTs negative for KIT exon 11 and PDGFRA exon 18 mutations. There were seven substitutions of aspartic acid for valine at codon 561 (V561D) and four in-frame deletions with point mutations clustering between codons 566 and 571. The majority of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations had pure or predominant epithelioid morphology. Low mitotic activity, < or =5 mitoses/50HPF was detected in 81% of analyzed GISTs including larger, >5 cm tumors. Based on long-term follow-up (average 135 months), a majority (83.5%) of GISTs with PDGFRA mutations followed a benign course.",cancer
902,LKB1 gene inactivation does not sensitize non-small cell lung cancer cells to mTOR inhibitors in vitro.,"Previous study has shown that endometrial cancers with LKB1 inactivation are highly responsive to mTOR inhibitors. In this study we examined the effect of LKB1 gene status on mTOR inhibitor responses in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Lung cancer cell lines Calu-1, H460, H1299, H1792, and A549 were treated with the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin or everolimus (RAD001). The mTOR activity was evaluated by measuring the phosphorylation of 4EBP1 and S6K, the two primary mTOR substrates. Cells proliferation was measured by MTS or sulforhodamine B assays. The basal level of mTOR activity in LKB1 mutant A549 and H460 cells was significantly higher than that in LKB1 wild-type Calu-1 and H1792 cells. However, the LKB1 mutant A549 and H460 cells were not more sensitive to the mTOR inhibitors than the LKB1 wild-type Calu-1 and H1792 cells. Moreover, knockdown of LKB1 gene in H1299 cells did not increase the sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitors. Treatment with rapamycin or RAD001 significantly increased the phosphorylation of AKT in both LKB1 wild-type and LKB1 mutant NSCLC cells, which was attenuated by the PI3K inhibitor LY294002. Furthermore, RAD001 combined with LY294002 markedly enhanced the growth inhibition on LKB1 wild-type H1792 cells and LKB1 mutant A549 cells. LKB1 gene inactivation in NSCLC cells does not increase the sensitivity to the mTOR inhibitors. The negative feedback activation of AKT by mTOR inhibition may contribute to the resistance of NSCLC cells to mTOR inhibitors.",cancer
1562,"Patterns of Gene Flow between Crop and Wild Carrot, Daucus carota (Apiaceae) in the United States.","Studies of gene flow between crops and their wild relatives have implications for both management practices for cultivation and understanding the risk of transgene escape. These types of studies may also yield insight into population dynamics and the evolutionary consequences of gene flow for wild relatives of crop species. Moreover, the comparison of genetic markers with different modes of inheritance, or transmission, such as those of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes, can inform the relative risk of transgene escape via pollen versus seed. Here we investigate patterns of gene flow between crop and wild carrot, Daucus carota (Apiaceae) in two regions of the United States. We employed 15 nuclear simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and one polymorphic chloroplast marker. Further, we utilized both conventional population genetic metrics along with Shannon diversity indices as the latter have been proposed to be more sensitive to allele frequency changes and differentiation. We found that populations in both regions that were proximal to crop fields showed lower levels of differentiation to the crops than populations that were located farther away. We also found that Shannon measures were more sensitive to differences in both genetic diversity and differentiation in our study. Finally, we found indirect evidence of paternal transmission of chloroplast DNA and accompanying lower than expected levels of chloroplast genetic structure amongst populations as might be expected if chloroplast DNA genes flow through both seed and pollen. Our findings of substantial gene flow for both nuclear and chloroplast markers demonstrate the efficiency of both pollen and seed to transfer genetic information amongst populations of carrot.",nonCancer
183,Aurora kinases as prognostic biomarkers in ovarian carcinoma.,"We investigated the expression of Aurora kinases A and B by immunohistochemistry in 68 ovarian carcinomas to analyze their prognostic value. The amplification of AURKA gene by fluorescence in situ hybridization was also assessed. Overall, 58.8% and 85.3% of ovarian carcinomas showed expression of Aurora A and B, respectively. Amplification of AURKA was found in 27.6% of cases examined. Tumors with Aurora A expression showed a lower rate of recurrence than those tumors without Aurora A expression (65% versus 91.7%, P = .019). In the univariate analysis, patients with Aurora A and B expression showed an increased progression-free survival (P = .023 and .06, respectively, log-rank test) and overall survival (P = .03 and .02, respectively, log-rank test). The multivariate analysis adjusted to optimal surgery by Cox proportional hazards regression showed Aurora A expression as an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival (P = .03) and overall survival (P = .02). In conclusion, Aurora A expression seems to have a prognostic value in ovarian carcinoma.",cancer
813,Molecular remission and reversal of myelofibrosis in response to imatinib mesylate treatment in patients with the myeloproliferative variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome.,"We recently described a subset of patients with a myeloproliferative variant of hypereosinophilic syndrome (MHES) characterized by elevated serum tryptase levels, increased atypical mast cells in the bone marrow, tissue fibrosis, and the presence of the fusion tyrosine kinase, FIP1L1-PDGFRalpha, which is a therapeutic target of imatinib mesylate. Seven patients with MHES were treated with imatinib mesylate (300-400 mg daily). Clinical improvement and resolution of eosinophilia was observed in all patients, although cardiac dysfunction, when present, was not altered by therapy. Reversal of bone marrow pathology, including increased cellularity, the presence of spindle-shaped mast cells, and myelofibrosis, was evident in all patients at 4 to 8 weeks following initiation of therapy. This was accompanied by a decrease in activated eosinophils and mast cells in the peripheral blood and bone marrow, respectively. Serum tryptase levels declined rapidly to normal levels in all patients and remained in the normal range throughout therapy. Molecular remission, with disappearance of detectable FIP1L1/PDGFRA (F/P) transcripts, was achieved in 5 of 6 patients tested. The lack of reversal of cardiac abnormalities and persistence of the F/P mutation in some patients suggests that early intervention with higher doses of imatinib mesylate may be desirable in the treatment of patients with MHES.",cancer
826,Elucidating distinct roles for NF1 in melanomagenesis.,"BRAF mutations play a well-established role in melanomagenesis; however, without additional genetic alterations, tumor development is restricted by oncogene-induced senescence (OIS). Here, we show that mutations in the NF1 tumor suppressor gene cooperate with BRAF mutations in melanomagenesis by preventing OIS. In a genetically engineered mouse model, Nf1 mutations suppress Braf-induced senescence, promote melanocyte hyperproliferation, and enhance melanoma development. Nf1 mutations function by deregulating both phosphoinositide 3-kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways. As such, Nf1/Braf-mutant tumors are resistant to BRAF inhibitors but are sensitive to combined inhibition of mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase and mTOR. Importantly, NF1 is mutated or suppressed in human melanomas that harbor concurrent BRAF mutations, NF1 ablation decreases the sensitivity of melanoma cell lines to BRAF inhibitors, and NF1 is lost in tumors from patients following treatment with these agents. Collectively, these studies provide mechanistic insight into how NF1 cooperates with BRAF mutations in melanoma and show that NF1/neurofibromin inactivation may have an impact on responses to targeted therapies.",cancer
927,CASP8 SNP D302H (rs1045485) is associated with worse survival in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma patients.,"Neuroblastoma is a pediatric cancer that exhibits a wide clinical spectrum ranging from spontaneous regression in low-risk patients to fatal disease in high-risk patients. The identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) may help explain the heterogeneity of neuroblastoma and assist in identifying patients at higher risk for poor survival. SNPs in the TP53 pathway are of special importance, as several studies have reported associations between TP53 pathway SNPs and cancer. Of note, less than 2% of neuroblastoma tumors have a TP53 mutation at diagnosis. We selected 21 of the most frequently studied SNPs in the TP53 pathway and evaluated their association with outcome in 500 neuroblastoma patients using TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. We investigated the impact of 21 SNPs on overall survival, event-free survival, age at diagnosis, MYCN status, and stage of the disease in 500 neuroblastoma patients. A missense SNP in exon 10 of the CASP8 gene SNP D302H was associated with worse overall and event-free survival in patients with MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma tumors.",cancer
569,Mutation and methylation analysis of TP53 in adrenal carcinogenesis.,"To investigate the role of coding region mutation and promoter hypermethylation of TP53 in adrenocortical cancer formation. Twenty sporadic adrenocortical cancers (ACCs) and five normal adrenal tissue samples were available for analysis. Coding region mutation of TP53 in 20 ACCs was examined by polymerase chain amplification using intronic primers for exons 2-11 and direct sequencing of the product. In 10 ACCs and five normal adrenal tissue specimens, methylation of the 16 CpG sites within the TP53 promoter was examined using bisulphite methylation sequencing. Coding region mutation in TP53 was demonstrated in 5 of 20 ACCs. There were four mis-sense mutations and one frameshift mutation. Four of 5 patients with a TP53 mutation had metastases at diagnosis or detected soon thereafter and 3 of 4 died of disease within 12 months of surgical resection. No methylation was seen in the TP53 promoter in 10 ACC and the five normal adrenal tissues examined. Coding region mutation in TP53 occurs in 25% of ACCs with a trend toward a poorer prognosis. Promoter methylation of TP53 is not present in ACC as a mechanism for tumour suppressor gene (TSG) inactivation and, therefore, other genes in the 17p13 region are implicated in adrenal carcinogenesis.",cancer
1761,Lipid spontaneous curvatures estimated from temperature-dependent changes in inverse hexagonal phase lattice parameters: the effects of metal cations.,"Recently we reported a method for estimating the spontaneous curvatures of lipids from temperature dependent changes in the lattice parameter of inverse hexagonal liquid crystal phases of binary lipid mixtures. This method makes use of 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoethanolamine, (DOPE) as a host lipid, which preferentially forms an inverse hexagonal phase, to which a guest lipid of unknown spontaneous curvature is added. The lattice parameters of these binary lipid mixtures are determined by small angle X-ray diffraction at a range of temperatures and the spontaneous curvature of the guest lipid is determined from these data. Here we report the use of this method on a wide range of lipids under different ionic conditions. We demonstrate that our method provides spontaneous curvature values for DOPE, cholesterol and monoolein that are within the range of values reported in the literature. Anionic lipids 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphatidic acid (DOPA) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphoserine (DOPS) were found to exhibit spontaneous curvatures that depend on the concentration of divalent cations present in the mixtures. We show that the range of curvatures estimated experimentally for DOPA and DOPS can be explained by a series of equilibria arising from lipid-cation exchange reactions. Our data indicate a universal relationship between the spontaneous curvature of a lipid and the extent to which it affects the lattice parameter of the hexagonal phase of DOPE when it is part of a binary mixture. This universal relationship affords a rapid way of estimating the spontaneous curvatures of lipids that are expensive, only available in small amounts or are of limited chemical stability.",nonCancer

428,EGFR gene copy number as a predictive biomarker for resistance to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer treatment: a meta-analysis.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) have already shown the therapeutic effectiveness in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). But many patients resist to the treatment. The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess EGFR gene copy number (GCN) as a candidate predictive biomarker for resistance to anti-EGFR MoAbs in mCRC treatment. Systematic computerized searches of the PubMed, EMBase and Cochrane Library were performed. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The second endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). The pooled odd ratio (OR) and pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) for ORR were estimated. The pooled hazard ratios (HR) for PFS and OS were also calculated. Fourteen studies with 1,021 patients were included. Increased EGFR GCN was associated with increased ORR (OR=6.905; 95% CI: 4.489-10.620). It was also found in wild-type KRAS mCRC patients, with the pooled OR of 8.133 (95% CI: 4.316-15.326). GCN has medium value for predicting ORR, with the pooled sensitivity of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.84), the pooled specificity of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.55-0.62). In wild-type KRAS mCRC patients, the sensitivity and the specificity were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.87) and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.53-0.66), respectively. Increased EGFR GCN was associated with increased PFS (HR=0.557; 95% CI: 0.382-0.732) and OS (HR=0.579; 95% CI: 0.422-0.737). This meta-analysis suggests that EGFR GCN represents a predictive biomarker for tumor response in mCRC patients treated with MoAbs regardless of KRAS mutation. mCRC patients with increased EGFR GCN are more likely to have a better response, PFS, and OS when treated with cetuximab or panitumumab.",cancer
976,Preclinical Evidence of Anti-Tumor Activity Induced by EZH2 Inhibition in Human Models of Synovial Sarcoma.,"The catalytic activities of covalent and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling are central to regulating the conformational state of chromatin and the resultant transcriptional output. The enzymes that catalyze these activities are often contained within multiprotein complexes in nature. Two such multiprotein complexes, the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) methyltransferase and the SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF) chromatin remodeler have been reported to act in opposition to each other during development and homeostasis. An imbalance in their activities induced by mutations/deletions in complex members (e.g. SMARCB1) has been suggested to be a pathogenic mechanism in certain human cancers. Here we show that preclinical models of synovial sarcoma-a cancer characterized by functional SMARCB1 loss via its displacement from the SWI/SNF complex through the pathognomonic SS18-SSX fusion protein-display sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of EZH2, the catalytic subunit of PRC2. Treatment with tazemetostat, a clinical-stage, selective and orally bioavailable small-molecule inhibitor of EZH2 enzymatic activity reverses a subset of synovial sarcoma gene expression and results in concentration-dependent cell growth inhibition and cell death specifically in SS18-SSX fusion-positive cells in vitro. Treatment of mice bearing either a cell line or two patient-derived xenograft models of synovial sarcoma leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition with correlative inhibition of trimethylation levels of the EZH2-specific substrate, lysine 27 on histone H3. These data demonstrate a dependency of SS18-SSX-positive, SMARCB1-deficient synovial sarcomas on EZH2 enzymatic activity and suggests the potential utility of EZH2-targeted drugs in these genetically defined cancers.",cancer
2048,Photoconvertible Behavior of LSSmOrange Applicable for Single Emission Band Optical Highlighting.,"Photoswitchable fluorescent proteins are capable of changing their spectral properties upon light irradiation, thus allowing one to follow a chosen subpopulation of molecules in a biological system. Recently, we revealed a photoinduced absorption band shift of LSSmOrange, which was originally engineered to have a large energy gap between excitation and emission bands. Here, we evaluated the performance of LSSmOrange as a fluorescent tracer in living cells. The absorption maximum of LSSmOrange in HeLa cells shifted from 437 nm to 553 nm upon illumination with a 405-, 445-, 458-, or 488-nm laser on a laser-scanning microscope, whereas the emission band remained same (∼570 nm). LSSmOrange behaves as a freely diffusing protein in living cells, enabling the use of the protein as a fluorescence tag for studies of protein dynamics. By targeting LSSmOrange in mitochondria, we observed an exchange of soluble molecules between the matrices upon mitochondrial fusion. Since converted and unconverted LSSmOrange proteins have similar emission spectra, this tracer offers unique possibilities for multicolor imaging. The fluorescence emission from LSSmOrange was spectrally distinguishable from that of eYFP and mRFP, and could be separated completely by applying linear unmixing. Furthermore, by using a femtosecond laser at 850 nm, we showed that a two-photon process could evoke a light-induced red shift of the absorption band of LSSmOrange, providing a strict confinement of the conversion volume in a three-dimensional space.",nonCancer

We report design and preclinical evaluation of AP24534, a potent, orally available multitargeted kinase inhibitor active against T315I and other BCR-ABL mutants. AP24534 inhibited all tested BCR-ABL mutants in cellular and biochemical assays, suppressed BCR-ABL(T315I)-driven tumor growth in mice, and completely abrogated resistance in cell-based mutagenesis screens.

70,Prognostic relevance of integrated genetic profiling in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to presentation and clinical outcome. The prognostic value of recently identified somatic mutations has not been systematically evaluated in a phase 3 trial of treatment for AML. We performed a mutational analysis of 18 genes in 398 patients younger than 60 years of age who had AML and who were randomly assigned to receive induction therapy with high-dose or standard-dose daunorubicin. We validated our prognostic findings in an independent set of 104 patients. We identified at least one somatic alteration in 97.3% of the patients. We found that internal tandem duplication in FLT3 (FLT3-ITD), partial tandem duplication in MLL (MLL-PTD), and mutations in ASXL1 and PHF6 were associated with reduced overall survival (P=0.001 for FLT3-ITD, P=0.009 for MLL-PTD, P=0.05 for ASXL1, and P=0.006 for PHF6); CEBPA and IDH2 mutations were associated with improved overall survival (P=0.05 for CEBPA and P=0.01 for IDH2). The favorable effect of NPM1 mutations was restricted to patients with co-occurring NPM1 and IDH1 or IDH2 mutations. We identified genetic predictors of outcome that improved risk stratification among patients with AML, independently of age, white-cell count, induction dose, and post-remission therapy, and validated the significance of these predictors in an independent cohort. High-dose daunorubicin, as compared with standard-dose daunorubicin, improved the rate of survival among patients with DNMT3A or NPM1 mutations or MLL translocations (P=0.001) but not among patients with wild-type DNMT3A, NPM1, and MLL (P=0.67). We found that DNMT3A and NPM1 mutations and MLL translocations predicted an improved outcome with high-dose induction chemotherapy in patients with AML. These findings suggest that mutational profiling could potentially be used for risk stratification and to inform prognostic and therapeutic decisions regarding patients with AML.

805,The 2016 revision to the World Health Organization classification of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia.,"The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues was last updated in 2008. Since then, there have been numerous advances in the identification of unique biomarkers associated with some myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemias, largely derived from gene expression analysis and next-generation sequencing that can significantly improve the diagnostic criteria as well as the prognostic relevance of entities currently included in the WHO classification and that also suggest new entities that should be added. Therefore, there is a clear need for a revision to the current classification. The revisions to the categories of myeloid neoplasms and acute leukemia will be published in a monograph in 2016 and reflect a consensus of opinion of hematopathologists, hematologists, oncologists, and geneticists. The 2016 edition represents a revision of the prior classification rather than an entirely new classification and attempts to incorporate new clinical, prognostic, morphologic, immunophenotypic, and genetic data that have emerged since the last edition. The major changes in the classification and their rationale are presented here.",cancer
532,Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Gene Amplification in Patients with Advanced-stage NSCLC.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) represent novel, effective tools in the management of advanced-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to evaluate the incidence and predictive role of EGFR gene amplification in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs. The study included 290 patients with advanced-stage (IIIB or IV) NSCLC. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used for detection of EGFR gene amplification and EGFR mutations, respectively. EGFR amplification was detected in 26 (9.0%) patients. EGFR amplification was found more frequently in patients harboring the EGFR mutation (p<0.001). No significant corelation between EGFR gene amplification and survival was observed. EGFR gene amplification is associated with EGFR gene mutation. EGFR gene amplification is not a feasible predictive biomarker for treatment with EGFR-TKIs in patients with advanced-stage NSCLC.",cancer
1345,"Cancer/Testis Antigens: Expression, Regulation, Tumor Invasion, and Use in Immunotherapy of Cancers.","Cancer/testis antigens (CTAs) are named based on their expression pattern that is restricted in a number of normal and abnormal tissues. Tumor cells frequently express antigens whose expression is typically restricted to germ cells. Their unique expression pattern is guaranteed by precise epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Because of their tumor-limited, high immunogenicity, and biased expression, discovery of these molecules provides unprecedented opportunities for further research and clinical development in the field of cancer diagnosis and immunotherapy. Evolving evidence reveals that a number of CTAs stimulate epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) and generation of cancer stem-like cells, intensifying metastasis, invasion, and tumorigenesis. Based on these features, CTAs attract attention to be considered as ideal targets for developing several clinical trials, many of them concentrating on CTA vaccine therapy. According to recent practical clinical interest, more characterizations of CTA regulation are identified. CTA expression has been demonstrated in a variety of human cancer tissues, and some of them have been found to elicit humoral and/or cellular immune responses in cancer patients. CTAs are brilliant targets for anticancer drug discovery, targeted tumor therapy, and diagnostic biomarkers, furthermore, valued genes in the study of immunotherapy, promoting tumorigenesis, and malignant progression. This review outlines and categorizes our current understanding of the complex and biased process of CTAs mRNA and protein expression in cancer, and supplies the most recent information on their regulation and function.

141,The PI3K pathway as drug target in human cancer.,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling axis impacts on cancer cell growth, survival, motility, and metabolism. This pathway is activated by several different mechanisms in cancers, including somatic mutation and amplification of genes encoding key components. In addition, PI3K signaling may serve integral functions for noncancerous cells in the tumor microenvironment. Consequently, therapeutics targeting the PI3K pathway are being developed at a rapid pace, and preclinical and early clinical studies are beginning to suggest specific strategies to effectively use them. However, the central role of PI3K signaling in a large array of diverse biologic processes raises concerns about its use in therapeutics and increases the need to develop sophisticated strategies for its use. In this review, we will discuss how PI3K signaling affects the growth and survival of tumor cells. From this vantage, we will consider how inhibitors of the PI3K signaling cascade, either alone or in combination with other therapeutics, can most effectively be used for the treatment of cancer.",cancer
1779,Revisiting the role of environmental and climate factors on the epidemiology of Kawasaki disease.,"Can environmental factors, such as air-transported preformed toxins, be of key relevance to the health outcomes of poorly understood human ailments (e.g., rheumatic diseases such as vasculitides, some inflammatory diseases, or even severe childhood acquired heart diseases)? Can the physical, chemical, or biological features of air masses be linked to the emergence of diseases such as Kawasaki disease (KD), Henoch-Schönlein purpura, Takayasu's aortitis, and ANCA-associated vasculitis? These diseases surprisingly share some common epidemiological features. For example, they tend to appear as clusters of cases grouped geographically and temporarily progress in nonrandom sequences that repeat every year in a similar way. They also show concurrent trend changes within regions in countries and among different world regions. In this paper, we revisit transdisciplinary research on the role of environmental and climate factors in the epidemiology of KD as a paradigmatic example of this group of diseases. Early-warning systems based on environmental alerts, if successful, could be implemented as a way to better inform patients who are predisposed to, or at risk for, developing KD.

Most of these approaches are highly specialized, offering different formulation of BPD and different mechanisms by which recovery is made possible. Mental health clinicians are challenged by the degree of specialization and clinical resources that these approaches require in their empirically validated adherent forms. While these effective treatments have renewed optimism for the treatment of BPD, clinicians may feel limited in their ability to offer any of them or may integrate an eclectic assortment of features from the different treatments. This article will evaluate four major evidence-based treatments for BPD-dialectical behavioral therapy, mentalization-based treatment, transference-focused psychotherapy, and General Psychiatric Management-and possible modes of implementation in adherent and integrative forms. Models of implementing these diverse treatment approaches will be evaluated, and the potential advantages of combining evidence-based treatments will be discussed, along with some cautionary notes. A proposal for providing stepwise care through assessment of clinical severity will be presented as a means of achieving system-wide changes and greater access to care.",nonCancer
344,Increased expression of MyD88 and association with paclitaxel resistance in breast cancer.,"MyD88 was reported to be associated with paclitaxel sensitivity in lung cancer; however, its roles in breast cancer remain unclear. The objective of this study is to investigate the expression and function of MyD88 in breast cancer. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to analyze the expression of MyD88 in both breast cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues. Real-time PCR and Western blots were further used to measure the messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein expression. The proliferation was assessed by WST-1. Flow cytometry was used to measure the cell cycle and apoptosis. The transwell assay was used to observe the change of migration and invasion of transfected cells. In breast cancer tissues, the expression of MyD88 was significantly higher than that in tumor-adjacent normal tissues (P < 0.001). MyD88 expression was found to be associated with the differentiation stages (P = 0.019). Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed statistically significant difference on survival in patients with high expression of MyD88 compared with those with normal expression of MyD88 (P = 0.018). Knockdown of MyD88 reduced the proliferation, migration, and invasion of MCF-7 cells and increased the sensitivity of MCF-7 cells to paclitaxel treatment through the inhibition of activation of NF-κB via PI3K/Akt. Our data indicate that MyD88 may be a potential target molecule to be used in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.",cancer

The objective of this study was to identify risk factors for these missed opportunities of HIV-1 diagnosis.|A national study, recruiting 409 newly diagnosed HIV-1 infected adults over a 2.5-year period, was performed. Logistic regression models tested the relationship between missed presentation and patient's neglect versus socio-demographic and behavioural risk factors.

Patients infected in the East, with present/previous substance use or a previous negative HIV test were more likely to take the initiative to test on their own, whereas those >50 years and with a previously missed presentation had significantly reduced odds, p<0.05.|Individuals without epidemiological indicators of HIV are more likely to have a history of missed presentations, to neglect symptoms and are less prone to take an initiative to test for HIV themselves. It is important to further implement testing to include all patients with symptoms and conditions indicative of HIV.",nonCancer
1614,Comparison of postoperative acute kidney injury between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy: A propensity score matching analysis.,"Ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions are frequently performed after radical cystectomy. However, complications after radical cystectomy may be different according to the type of urinary diversion. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after surgery and increases costs, morbidity, and mortality of hospitalized patients. This study was performed to compare the incidence of postoperative AKI between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy.All consecutive patients who underwent radical cystectomy in 2004 to 2014 in a single tertiary care center were identified. The patients were divided into the ileal conduit and ileal neobladder groups. Preoperative variables, including demographics, cancer-related data and laboratory values, as well as intraoperative data and postoperative outcomes, including AKI, intensive care unit admission rate, and the duration of hospital stay, were evaluated between the groups. Postoperative AKI was defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome criteria. Propensity score matching analysis was performed to reduce the influence of possible confounding variables and adjust for intergroup differences.After performing 1:1 propensity score matching, the ileal conduit and ileal neobladder groups each included 101 patients. The overall incidence of AKI after radical cystectomy was 30.7% (62 out of 202) and the incidences did not significantly differ between the groups (27 [26.7%], ileal conduit group vs 35 [34.7%], ileal neobladder group, P = 0.268). Intraoperative data, intensive care unit admission rate, and the duration of hospital stay were not significantly different between the groups.Postoperative AKI did not significantly differ between ileal conduit and neobladder urinary diversions after radical cystectomy. This finding provides additional information useful for appropriate selection of the urinary diversion type in conjunction with radical cystectomy.",nonCancer

No difference in the 2-, 3-year OS or 1-, 2-year LRFS was observed, whereas patients in three weekly CCRT arm tended to have a better 5-year OS (HR=1.79, 95%C 0.97-3.31, p=0.06). Weekly arm seemed to show less gastrointestinal toxicities (RR=0.59, 95%CI 0.34-1.02, p=0.06), but similar hematologic toxicity compared to three weekly arm. Subgroup analysis displayed more grade ≥3 mucositis (RR=1.72, p=0.01), and more chemotherapy related delay/interrupt (RR=2.68, p<0.0001) in weekly arm for non-nasopharynx carcinoma (non-NPC) HNC.|We conducted the meta-analysis by searching PubMed, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Cochrane Library and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases.

830,Amuvatinib has cytotoxic effects against NRAS-mutant melanoma but not BRAF-mutant melanoma.,"Effective targeted therapy strategies are still lacking for the 15-20% of melanoma patients whose melanomas are driven by oncogenic NRAS. Here, we report on the NRAS-specific behavior of amuvatinib, a kinase inhibitor with activity against c-KIT, Axl, PDGFRα, and Rad51. An analysis of BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines showed the NRAS-mutant cohort to be enriched for targets of amuvatinib, including Axl, c-KIT, and the Axl ligand Gas6. Increasing concentrations of amuvatinib selectively inhibited the growth of NRAS-mutant, but not BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines, an effect associated with induction of S-phase and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis. Mechanistically, amuvatinib was noted to either inhibit Axl, AKT, and MAPK signaling or Axl and AKT signaling and to induce a DNA damage response. In three-dimensional cell culture experiments, amuvatinib was cytotoxic against NRAS-mutant melanoma cell lines. Thus, we show for the first time that amuvatinib has proapoptotic activity against melanoma cell lines, with selectivity observed for those harboring oncogenic NRAS.",cancer
931,Overexpression of ETV4 is associated with poor prognosis in prostate cancer: involvement of uPA/uPAR and MMPs.,"ETS gene fusions involving ERG, ETV1, ETV4, ETV5, and FLI1 define a distinct class of prostate cancer (PCa), and this might have a bearing on diagnosis, prognosis, and rational therapeutic targeting. In the current study, we focused on the clinicopathological significance of ETV4 in Chinese PCa patients and the mechanisms whereby ETV4 overexpression mediates tumor invasion in the prostate. Overall, ETV4 overexpression was identified in 30.4 % (45/148) of PCa cases by immunohistochemistry. Accordingly, ETV4 was rearranged in only 1.6 % (2/128) of PCa patients. Clinically, ETV4 overexpression was significantly correlated with Gleason score (P = 0.045) and pathological tumor stage (P = 0.041). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that ETV4 is an unfavorable independent prognostic factor (P = 0.040). Functional studies further showed that small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown of ETV4 significantly decreases proliferation and invasion of PC-3 cell and partially reverses epithelial-mesenchymal transition in vitro. Notably, ETV4 knockdown significantly downregulated expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor (uPAR) at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that ETV4 regulates uPA expression through direct binding to its promoter region. Additionally, ETV4 knockdown was also observed to significantly inhibit expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. In conclusion, for the first time, our study suggested that ETV4 is an independent poor prognostic factor in Chinese PCa patients. Silencing of ETV4 suppresses invasion of PCa cells by inhibiting the expression of uPA/uPAR as well as MMPs. Further studies will be needed to determine whether ETV4 could be regarded as a potential target for the management and prevention of PCa.",cancer
1757,"Synthesis and Structures of 9-Oxabispidine Analogues of Cisplatin, Carboplatin, and Oxaliplatin.","The literature synthesis of 9-oxabispidine [OC6H10(NH)2, C] has been revisited and optimized, which includes determination of the crystal structures of C, the secondary component trans-(PhSO2)NC4H6O(CH2I)2 (trans-III), and the unexpected solute intermediate OC6H10(NSO2Ph)2·(1)/2py (V·(1)/2py). The reaction of (1,5-hexadiene)platinum dichloride with C yields {OC6H10(NH)2}PtCl2 (C1), which is converted to {OC6H10(NH)2}Pt(cbdca)·5H2O (C2) and {OC6H10(NH)2}Pt(C2O4) (C3). In the crystal, C1 forms a planar 2D network by N-H··Cl and N-H··O hydrogen bonding. In the crystal structure of C2, which is isomorphous to the parent bispidine compound (A2), all complex molecules are encapsulated by a water shell. While complexes C1 and C3 are virtually insoluble in water, C2 dissolves quite well. The low cytotoxicity of compounds C1-C3 is explained by an increased polarity of the bonds in the C skeleton as a consequence of the electronegative O atom.",nonCancer
1143,Expression analysis of genes at 3q26-q27 involved in frequent amplification in squamous cell lung carcinoma.,"Gene amplifications are known to occur frequently in lung cancer. Recently, we identified gene amplifications at 3q26 in squamous cell lung carcinoma (SCC) using reverse chromosome painting. Here, our aim was to analyse the expression of genes which map within the amplified chromosomal region. The genes which were selected for their known function and their potential involvement in tumour development included the genes for ribosomal protein L22 (RPL22), butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE), glucose transporter 2 (SLC2A2), transferrin receptor (TFRC), thrombopoietin (THPO) and the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase catalytic alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA). While five genes were expressed in the majority of the 17 samples of SCC, the gene for the glucose transporter 2 (SLC2A2) was expressed in only three cases, excluding SLC2A2 as the target gene of the amplification unit. For a subset of tumours, we determined the amplification status of the six genes. The TFRC, PIK3CA, BCHE, THPO and SLC2A2 genes were amplified in several cases, whereas the RPL22 gene was amplified in only one case. The combined amplification and expression data of this and our previous studies indicate that the amplified region at 3q26 contains several genes that are transcribed in SCC, providing the possibility that several amplified and functionally important genes at 3q26 may be involved in the pathogenesis of SCC.",cancer
604,Missense mutations in PML-RARA are critical for the lack of responsiveness to arsenic trioxide treatment.,"Arsenic trioxide (As₂O₃) is a highly effective treatment for patients with refractory/relapsed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), but resistance to As₂O₃ has recently been seen. In the present study, we report the findings that 2 of 15 patients with refractory/relapsed APL treated with As₂O₃ were clinically As₂O₃ resistant. Leukemia cells from these 2 patients harbored missense mutations in promyelocytic leukemia gene-retinoic acid receptor-α gene (PML-RARA) transcripts, resulting in amino acid substitutions of A216V and L218P in the PML B2 domain. When wild-type or mutated PML-RARA (PR-WT and PR-B/L-mut, respectively) were overexpressed in HeLa cells, immunoblotting showed SUMOylated and/or oligomerized protein bands in PR-WT but not in PR-B/L-mut after As₂O₃ treatment. Protein-localization analysis indicated that PR-WT in the soluble fraction was transferred to the insoluble fraction after treatment with As₂O₃, but PR-B/L-mut was stably detected in fractions both with and without As₂O₃. Immunofluorescent microscopy analysis showed PR-WT localization as a microgranular pattern in the cytoplasm without As₂O₃ and as a macrogranular pattern with As₂O₃. PR-B/L-mut was diffusely observed in the cytoplasm with and without As₂O₃. Nearly identical localization patterns were observed in patients' primary cells. Therefore, B2 domain mutations may play an important role in aberrant molecular responses toAs₂O₃ and may be critical for As₂O₃ resistance in APL.",cancer

903,Systemic and CNS activity of the RET inhibitor vandetanib combined with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus in KIF5B-RET re-arranged non-small cell lung cancer with brain metastases.,"In-frame fusion KIF5B (the-kinesin-family-5B-gene)-RET transcripts have been characterized in 1-2% of non-small cell lung cancers and are known oncogenic drivers. The RET tyrosine kinase inhibitor, vandetanib, suppresses fusion-induced, anchorage-independent growth activity. In vitro studies have shown that vandetanib is a high-affinity substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp1/Abcg2) but is not transported by P-glycoprotein (P-gp), limiting its blood-brain barrier penetration. A co-administration strategy to enhance the brain accumulation of vandetanib by modulating P-gp/Abcb1- and Bcrp1/Abcg2-mediated efflux with mTOR inhibitors, specifically everolimus, was shown to increase the blood-brain barrier penetration. We report the first bench-to-bedside evidence that RET inhibitor combined with an mTOR inhibitor is active against brain-metastatic RET-rearranged lung cancer and the first evidence of blood-brain barrier penetration. A 74-year-old female with progressive adenocarcinoma of the lung (wild-type EGFR and no ALK rearrangement) presented for therapy options. A deletion of 5'RET was revealed by FISH assay, indicating RET-gene rearrangement. Because of progressive disease in the brain, she was enrolled in a clinical trial with vandetanib and everolimus (NCT01582191). Comprehensive genomic profiling revealed fusion of KIF5B (the-kinesin-family-5B-gene) and RET, in addition to AKT2 gene amplification. After two cycles of therapy a repeat MRI brain showed a decrease in the intracranial disease burden and PET/CT showed systemic response as well. Interestingly, AKT2 amplification seen is a critical component of the PI3K/mTOR pathway, alterations of which has been associated with both de novo and acquired resistance to targeted therapy. The addition of everolimus may have both overcome the AKT2 amplification to produce a response in addition to its direct effects on the RET gene. Our case report forms the first evidence of blood-brain barrier penetration by vandetanib in combination with everolimus. Further research is required in this setting.",cancer
1804,Incubation of Cue-Induced Craving in Adults Addicted to Cocaine Measured by Electroencephalography.,"A common trigger for relapse in drug addiction is the experience of craving via exposure to cues previously associated with drug use. Preclinical studies have consistently demonstrated incubation of cue-induced drug-seeking during the initial phase of abstinence, followed by a decline over time. In humans, the incubation effect has been shown for alcohol, nicotine, and methamphetamine addictions, but not for heroin or cocaine addiction. Understanding the trajectory of cue-induced craving during abstinence in humans is of importance for addiction medicine.|To assess cue-induced craving for cocaine in humans using both subjective and objective indices of cue-elicited responses.|Seventy-six individuals addicted to cocaine with varying durations of abstinence (ie, 2 days, 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year) participated in this laboratory-based cross-sectional study from June 19, 2007, to November 26, 2012. The late positive potential component of electroencephalography, a recognized marker of incentive salience, was used to track motivated attention to drug cues across these self-selected groups. Participants also completed subjective ratings of craving for cocaine before presentation of a cue, and ratings of cocaine ""liking"" (hedonic feelings toward cocaine) and ""wanting"" (craving for cocaine) after presentation of cocaine-related pictures. Data analysis was conducted from June 5, 2015, to March 30, 2016.|The late positive potential amplitudes and ratings of liking and wanting cocaine in response to cocaine-related pictures were quantified and compared across groups.|Among the 76 individuals addicted to cocaine, 19 (25%) were abstinent for 2 days, 20 (26%) were abstinent for 1 week, 15 (20%) were abstinent for 1 month, 12 (16%) were abstinent for 6 months, and 10 (13%) were abstinent for 1 year. In response to drug cues, the mean (SD) late positive potential amplitudes showed a parabolic trajectory that was higher at 1 (1.26 [1.36] µV) and 6 (1.17 [1.19] µV) months of abstinence and lower at 2 days (0.17 [1.09] µV), 1 week (0.36 [1.26] µV), and 1 year (-0.27 [1.74] µV) of abstinence (P = .02, partial η2 = 0.16). In contrast, the subjective assessment of baseline craving (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 26.05 [9.85]; 1 week, 18.70 [11.01]; 1 month, 10.87 [10.70]; 6 months, 6.92 [8.47]; and 1 year, 3.00 [3.77]) and cue-induced liking (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 3.06 [2.34]; 1 week, 2.33 [2.87]; 1 month, 1.15 [2.03]; 6 months, 1.00 [2.24]; and 1 year, 1.00 [1.26]) and wanting (mean [SD] rating: 2 days, 3.44 [2.62]; 1 week, 2.72 [2.87]; 1 month, 1.46 [2.33]; 6 months, 1.00 [2.16]; and 1 year, 1.00 [1.55]) of cocaine showed a linear decline from 2 days to 1 year of abstinence (P ≤ .001, partial η2 > 0.26).|The late positive potential responses to drug cues, indicative of motivated attention, showed a trajectory similar to that reported in animal models. In contrast, we did not detect incubation of subjective cue-induced craving. Thus, the objective electroencephalographic measure may possibly be a better indicator of vulnerability to cue-induced relapse than subjective reports of craving, although this hypothesis must be empirically tested. These results suggest the importance of deploying intervention between 1 month and 6 months of abstinence, when addicted individuals may be most vulnerable to, and perhaps least cognizant of, risk of relapse.",nonCancer
1058,Frequent somatic mutations and loss of heterozygosity of the von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene in primary human renal cell carcinomas.,"We analyzed 47 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas (39 clear cell and 8 non-clear cell) for mutations of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene using the polymerase chain reaction and single strand conformational polymorphism analysis of DNA. All of the positive cases in single strand conformational polymorphism analyses were further characterized by direct sequencing. Somatic mutations were detected in 22 (56%) of 39 clear cell renal carcinomas including 15 deletions, 3 insertions, 3 missense mutations, and 1 nonsense mutation. Nineteen of these mutations predicted to produce truncation of the VHL protein. These mutations mainly occurred in the last one-third region of exons 1, 2, and 3. In addition, loss of heterozygosity of the VHL gene was observed in 16 (84%) of 19 informative clear cell renal carcinomas. No somatic mutations were detected in 8 non-clear cell carcinomas. These results show that the VHL tumor suppressor gene is one of the major tumor suppressor genes in human renal cell carcinomas, especially in the clear cell subtype renal cell carcinoma. Clear cell carcinoma might be distinguished from other pathological types of renal cell carcinomas by molecular genetic techniques.",cancer

2148,Andreev and Majorana bound states in single and double quantum dot structures.,"We present a numerical study of the emergence of Majorana and Andreev bound states in a system composed of two quantum dots, one of which is coupled to a conventional superconductor, SC1, and the other connects to a topological superconductor, SC2. By controlling the interdot coupling we can drive the system from two single (uncoupled) quantum dots to double (coupled) dot system configurations. We employ a recursive Green's function technique that provides us with numerically exact results for the local density of states of the system. We first show that in the uncoupled dot configuration (single dot behavior) the Majorana and the Andreev bound states appear in an individual dot in two completely distinct regimes. Therefore, they cannot coexist in the single quantum dot system. We then study the coexistence of these states in the coupled double dot configuration. In this situation we show that in the trivial phase of SC2, the Andreev states are bound to an individual quantum dot in the atomic regime (weak interdot coupling) or extended over the entire molecule in the molecular regime (strong interdot coupling). More interesting features are actually seen in the topological phase of SC2. In this case, in the atomic limit, the Andreev states appear bound to one of the quantum dots while a Majorana zero mode appears in the other one. In the molecular regime, on the other hand, the Andreev bound states take over the entire molecule while the Majorana state remains always bound to one of the quantum dots.",nonCancer

The applied reference range for TSH levels was between 0.45-4.49 mIU/L.|We collected IPD on 43,598 adults with TSH within the reference range from 17 cohorts, with median follow-up of 11.6 years (interquartile range 5.1-13.9), including 449,908 person-years. Age- and sex-adjusted pooled HR for TSH was 0.78 (95% Confidence Interval [CI], 0.65-0.95, across the reference range of TSH) for all stroke and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.62-1.09) for fatal stroke. For the FT4 analyses, the HR was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99-1.15, per SD increase) for all stroke and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.04-1.19) for fatal stroke. This was independent of cardiovascular risk factors including systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, smoking and prevalent diabetes.|Higher levels of TSH within the reference range may decrease risk of stroke, highlighting the need for further research focusing on the clinical consequences associated with differences within the reference range of thyroid function.",nonCancer
535,"Afatinib versus cisplatin plus gemcitabine for first-line treatment of Asian patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring EGFR mutations (LUX-Lung 6): an open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.","Afatinib-an oral irreversible ErbB family blocker-improves progression-free survival compared with pemetrexed and cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We compared afatinib with gemcitabine and cisplatin-a chemotherapy regimen widely used in Asia-for first-line treatment of Asian patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced NSCLC. This open-label, randomised phase 3 trial was done at 36 centres in China, Thailand, and South Korea. After central testing for EGFR mutations, treatment-naive patients (stage IIIB or IV cancer [American Joint Committee on Cancer version 6], performance status 0-1) were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive either oral afatinib (40 mg per day) or intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) on day 1 and day 8 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 of a 3-week schedule for up to six cycles. Randomisation was done centrally with a random number-generating system and an interactive internet and voice-response system. Randomisation was stratified by EGFR mutation (Leu858Arg, exon 19 deletions, or other; block size three). Clinicians and patients were not masked to treatment assignment, but the independent central imaging review group were. Treatment continued until disease progression, intolerable toxic effects, or withdrawal of consent. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival assessed by independent central review (intention-to-treat population). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01121393. 910 patients were screened and 364 were randomly assigned (242 to afatinib, 122 to gemcitabine and cisplatin). Median progression-free survival was significantly longer in the afatinib group (11·0 months, 95% CI 9·7-13·7) than in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group (5·6 months, 5·1-6·7; hazard ratio 0·28, 95% CI 0·20-0·39; p<0·0001). The most common treatment-related grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the afatinib group were rash or acne (35 [14·6%] of 239 patients), diarrhoea (13 [5·4%]), and stomatitis or mucositis (13 [5·4%]), compared with neutropenia (30 [26·5%] of 113 patients), vomiting (22 [19·5%]), and leucopenia (17 [15·0%]) in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 15 (6·3%) patients in the afatinib group and nine (8·0%) patients in the gemcitabine and cisplatin group. First-line afatinib significantly improves progression-free survival with a tolerable and manageable safety profile in Asian patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced lung NSCLC. Afatinib should be considered as a first-line treatment option for this patient population. Boehringer Ingelheim.",cancer

The peptide treatment serum contained gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and various peptides with neurotransmitter inhibiting and cell signaling properties. It was hypothesized that the peptide treatment serum would ameliorate eye and facial expression lines including crow's feet and forehead lines. The efficacy of the supporting skincare regimen was also evaluated. An expert investigator examined the subjects at rest and at maximum smile. Additionally, the subjects completed self-assessment questionnaires. At week 14, the expert investigator found a statistically significant improvement in facial lines, facial wrinkles, eye lines, and eye wrinkles at rest when compared to baseline results.

326,Activating mTOR mutations in a patient with an extraordinary response on a phase I trial of everolimus and pazopanib.,"Understanding the genetic mechanisms of sensitivity to targeted anticancer therapies may improve patient selection, response to therapy, and rational treatment designs. One approach to increase this understanding involves detailed studies of exceptional responders: rare patients with unexpected exquisite sensitivity or durable responses to therapy. We identified an exceptional responder in a phase I study of pazopanib and everolimus in advanced solid tumors. Whole-exome sequencing of a patient with a 14-month complete response on this trial revealed two concurrent mutations in mTOR, the target of everolimus. In vitro experiments demonstrate that both mutations are activating, suggesting a biologic mechanism for exquisite sensitivity to everolimus in this patient. The use of precision (or ""personalized"") medicine approaches to screen patients with cancer for alterations in the mTOR pathway may help to identify subsets of patients who may benefit from targeted therapies directed against mTOR.",cancer
792,Improved survival with vemurafenib in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutation.,"Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials of the BRAF kinase inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032) have shown response rates of more than 50% in patients with metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. We conducted a phase 3 randomized clinical trial comparing vemurafenib with dacarbazine in 675 patients with previously untreated, metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg per square meter of body-surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary end points were rates of overall and progression-free survival. Secondary end points included the response rate, response duration, and safety. A final analysis was planned after 196 deaths and an interim analysis after 98 deaths. At 6 months, overall survival was 84% (95% confidence interval [CI], 78 to 89) in the vemurafenib group and 64% (95% CI, 56 to 73) in the dacarbazine group. In the interim analysis for overall survival and final analysis for progression-free survival, vemurafenib was associated with a relative reduction of 63% in the risk of death and of 74% in the risk of either death or disease progression, as compared with dacarbazine (P<0.001 for both comparisons). After review of the interim analysis by an independent data and safety monitoring board, crossover from dacarbazine to vemurafenib was recommended. Response rates were 48% for vemurafenib and 5% for dacarbazine. Common adverse events associated with vemurafenib were arthralgia, rash, fatigue, alopecia, keratoacanthoma or squamous-cell carcinoma, photosensitivity, nausea, and diarrhea; 38% of patients required dose modification because of toxic effects. Vemurafenib produced improved rates of overall and progression-free survival in patients with previously untreated melanoma with the BRAF V600E mutation.

648,High circulating activin A level is associated with tumor progression and predicts poor prognosis in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Activin A (ActA)/follistatin (FST) signaling has been shown to be deregulated in different tumor types including lung adenocarcinoma (LADC). Here, we report that serum ActA protein levels are significantly elevated in LADC patients (n=64) as compared to controls (n=46, p=0.015). ActA levels also correlated with more advanced disease stage (p<0.0001) and T (p=0.0035) and N (p=0.0002) factors. M1 patients had significantly higher ActA levels than M0 patients (p<0.001). High serum ActA level was associated with poor overall survival (p<0.0001) and was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor (p=0.004). Serum FST levels were increased only in female LADC patients (vs. female controls, p=0.031). Two out of five LADC cell lines secreted biologically active ActA, while FST was produced in all of them. Transcripts of both type I and II ActA receptors were detected in all five LADC cell lines. In conclusion, our study does not only suggest that measuring blood ActA levels in LADC patients might improve the prediction of prognosis, but also indicates that this parameter might be a novel non-invasive biomarker for identifying LADC patients with organ metastases.",cancer
2267,Inhibition of AGS Cancer Cell Proliferation following siRNA-Mediated Downregulation of VEGFR2.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) play important roles in angiogenesis of different developmental mechanisms such as wound healing, embryogenesis and diseases, including different types of cancer. VEGFR2 is associated with cell proliferation, migration, and vascular permeability of endothelial cells. Blocking VEGF and its receptors is suggested as a therapeutic approach to prevent tumor growth. In this study, we aim to block VEGF signaling via small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibition of VEGFR2.|In this experimental study, we used the RNA interference (RNAi) mechanism to suppress expression of the VEGFR2 gene. We conducted the 3-(4,5-di- methylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), Western blot, and flow cytometry analyses of VEGFR2 expression.|Real-time PCR and Western blot results showed that VEGFR2 expression significantly downregulated. This suppression was followed by inhibition of cell prolifera- tion, reduction of viability, and induction of apoptosis in the cancer cells.|These findings suggest that VEGFR2 has a role in cell proliferation and tumor growth. Accordingly, it is suggested that VEGFR2 can be a therapeutic target for controlling tumor growth and proliferation.",nonCancer
270,Ponatinib is a pan-BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor: MD simulations and SIE study.,"BCR-ABL kinase domain inhibition can be used to treat chronic myeloid leukemia. The inhibitors such as imatinib, dasatinib and nilotinib are effective drugs but are resistant to some BCR-ABL mutations. The pan-BCR-ABL kinase inhibitor ponatinib exhibits potent activity against native, T315I, and all other clinically relevant mutants, and showed better inhibition than the previously known inhibitors. We have studied the molecular dynamics simulations and calculated solvated interaction energies of native and fourteen mutant BCR-ABL kinases (M244V, G250E, Q252H, Y253F, Y253H, E255K, E255V, T315A, T315I, F317L, F317V, M351T, F359V and H396P) complexed with ponatinib. These studies revealed that the interactions between ponatinib and individual residues in BCR-ABL kinase are also affected due to the remote residue mutations. We report that some residues, Met244, Lys245, Gln252, Gly254, Leu370 and Leu298 do not undergo any conformational changes, while the fluctuations in residues from P-loop, β3-, β5- strands and αC- helix are mainly responsible for ponatinib binding to native and all mutant BCR-ABL kinases. Our work provides the molecular mechanisms of native and mutant BCR-ABL kinases inhibition by ponatinib at atomic level that has not been studied before.",cancer
169,FLT3 D835/I836 mutations are associated with poor disease-free survival and a distinct gene-expression signature among younger adults with de novo cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia lacking FLT3 internal tandem duplications.,"The prognostic relevance of FLT3 D835/I836 mutations (FLT3-TKD) in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) remains to be established. After excluding patients with FLT3 internal tandem duplications, we compared treatment outcome of 16 de novo CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD with that of 123 patients with wild-type FLT3 (FLT3-WT), less than 60 years of age and similarly treated on Cancer and Leukemia Group B protocols. All FLT3-TKD(+) patients and 85% of FLT3-WT patients achieved a complete remission (P = .13). Disease-free survival (DFS) of FLT3-TKD(+) patients was worse than DFS of FLT3-WT patients (P = .01; estimated 3-year DFS rates, 31% vs 60%, respectively). In a multivariable analysis, FLT3-TKD was associated with worse DFS (P = .02) independent of NPM1 status and percentage of bone marrow blasts. To gain further biologic insights, a gene-expression signature differentiating FLT3-TKD(+) from FLT3-WT patients was identified. The signature (333 probe sets) included overexpression of VNN1, C3AR1, PTPN6, and multiple other genes involved in monocarboxylate transport activity, and underexpression of genes involved in signal transduction regulation. These associations with outcome, other prognostic markers, and the elucidated expression signature enhance our understanding of FLT3-TKD-associated biology and may lead to development of novel therapies that improve clinical outcome of CN-AML patients with FLT3-TKD.",cancer
700,Predicting everolimus treatment efficacy in patients with advanced endometrial carcinoma: a GINECO group study.,"This study aimed to determine whether the expression of various tumor biomarkers of the mTOR pathway predicts tumor response to everolimus in metastatic recurrent endometrial cancer. Tumor blocks from 44 patients of a phase II clinical trial receiving everolimus until progression or toxicity were collected and evaluated at 3 and 6 months for response. Thirty-six blocks were available for analysis of ER, PR, HER2, LKB1, PI3K, PTEN, pAKT, 4E-BP1, p4E-BP1, and S6RP expression by immunohistochemistry, PTEN deletion by FISH, and mutational status of K-RAS, PIK3CA, PTEN, and AKT1 genes. Twelve of 34 evaluable patients had partial response or stable disease (PR, SD) and 22 had progressive disease (PD). Immunohistochemistry showed that no protein expression could predict response to everolimus. Neither could loss of PTEN expression or PTEN deletion or PTEN mutation predict patient outcome. Thirty-one samples were assessable for K-RAS mutations (ten for PR+SD and 21 for PD). There are only four patients with K-RAS mutations and none of them responded to treatment. Median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were longer in patients without K-RAS mutations (PFS 3.12 ± 1.7 months versus 1.05 ± 0.4 months, p < 0.001; OS 9.28 ± 2.0 months versus 2.30 ± 1.4 months, p = 0.034). In conclusion, the level of expression of proteins of the PI3K/mTOR pathway tested in this study cannot predict response to everolimus. However, endometrial cancer patients with K-RAS mutations do not seem to derive benefit from everolimus treatment.",cancer
1976,"Original Mitsunobu triggered sequence involved in a one-pot domino process toward tetracyclic systems bearing bis-N,O-acetal junction.","Herein is reported an efficient one-pot domino process through a 1,6-aza-Michael addition-triggered sequence and an original Mitsunobu-type concerted sequence, for the synthesis of tetracyclic systems containing a bis-N,O-acetal junction. This methodology led to the construction of four new bonds, the cleavage of three C-O bonds and the generation of an asymmetric center. Mitsunobu activation afforded final ring closure involving the creation of two bonds which remains unprecedented among reported Mitsunobu-type sequences. The latter occurred in a regioselective fashion at the challenging C6-position of 2-pyridone intermediates. In case of adequately substituted enantiopure amino alcohols, up to 95: 5 of diastereoisomeric excess was achieved. Computational studies allowed the discrimination of a favored pathway for Mitsunobu sequence and supported the regioselectivity as well as the diastereoselectivity observed for this step.",nonCancer

527,"A phase II, multicenter trial of rindopepimut (CDX-110) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma: the ACT III study.","The epidermal growth factor receptor variant III deletion mutation, EGFRvIII, is expressed in ∼30% of primary glioblastoma and linked to poor long-term survival. Rindopepimut consists of the unique EGFRvIII peptide sequence conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. In previous phase II trials (ACTIVATE/ACT II), rindopepimut was well tolerated with robust EGFRvIII-specific immune responses and promising progression-free and overall survival. This multicenter, single-arm phase II clinical trial (ACT III) was performed to confirm these results. Rindopepimut and standard adjuvant temozolomide chemotherapy were administered to 65 patients with newly diagnosed EGFRvIII-expressing (EGFRvIII+) glioblastoma after gross total resection and chemoradiation. Progression-free survival at 5.5 months (∼8.5 mo from diagnosis) was 66%. Relative to study entry, median overall survival was 21.8 months, and 36-month overall survival was 26%. Extended rindopepimut vaccination (up to 3.5+ years) was well tolerated. Grades 1-2 injection site reactions were frequent. Anti-EGFRvIII antibody titers increased ≥4-fold in 85% of patients, and increased with duration of treatment. EGFRvIII was eliminated in 4/6 (67%) tumor samples obtained after >3 months of therapy. This study confirms, in a multicenter setting, the preliminary results seen in previous phase II trials of rindopepimut. A pivotal, double-blind, randomized, phase III trial (""ACT IV"") is under way.",cancer
965,Diagnostic utility of PAX8 in differentiation of mullerian from non-mullerian tumors.,"Considering the high prevalence of female genital tract neoplasms, non-specific nature of the initial symptoms, higher possibility of metastasis by the time of diagnosis, importance of differentiating metastatic Mullerian tumors or metastatic breast cancer in the female genital tract, especially in the ovary, and lack of diagnostic markers with high sensitivity and specificity, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the utility of Paired box protein8 (PAX8) expression in Mullerian and non-Mullerian neoplasms. In this descriptive-analytic, cross-sectional study, paraffin-embedded tissues of patients with definitive pathologic diagnosis of Mullerian and non-Mullerian tumors were selected. PAX8 immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed for all selected blocks. Immunopositivity of the slides for PAX8 was reviewed. It was defined as the presence of nuclear staining in at least 10% of the tumor cell nuclei. Thirty-seven Mullerian (including 18 ovarian epithelial tumors, 17 endometrial carcinoma and two endocervical adenocarcinoma) and 37 non-Mullerian tumors were studied for PAX8 expression. Twenty-nine of 37 (78.4%) and one of 37 (2.7%) of the Mullerian and non-Mullerian tumors were positive for PAX8, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of PAX8 by IHC for differentiation of Mullerian from non-Mullerian tumors was 78.4% and 97.3%, respectively. Our findings indicated that PAX8 could be used as a useful IHC marker for diagnosing Mullerian tumors. It has moderate to high sensitivity, but high specificity, for diagnosing carcinomas of Mullerian origin.",cancer
103,Acquired mutations in the genes encoding IDH1 and IDH2 both are recurrent aberrations in acute myeloid leukemia: prevalence and prognostic value.,"Somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were recently demonstrated in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but their prevalence and prognostic impact remain to be explored in large extensively characterized AML series, and also in various other hematologic malignancies. Here, we demonstrate in 893 newly diagnosed cases of AML mutations in the IDH1 (6%) and IDH2 (11%) genes. Moreover, we identified IDH mutations in 2 JAK2 V617F myeloproliferative neoplasias (n = 96), a single case of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 96), and none in chronic myeloid leukemias (n = 81). In AML, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are more common among AML with normal karyotype and NPM1(mutant) genotypes. IDH1 mutation status is an unfavorable prognostic factor as regards survival in a composite genotypic subset lacking FLT3(ITD) and NPM1(mutant). Thus, IDH1 and IDH2 mutations are common genetic aberrations in AML, and IDH1 mutations may carry prognostic value in distinct subtypes of AML.",cancer
999,"Ponatinib (AP24534), a multitargeted pan-FGFR inhibitor with activity in multiple FGFR-amplified or mutated cancer models.","Members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family of kinases (FGFR1-4) are dysregulated in multiple cancers. Ponatinib (AP24534) is an oral multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor being explored in a pivotal phase II trial in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia due to its potent activity against BCR-ABL. Ponatinib has also been shown to inhibit the in vitro kinase activity of all four FGFRs, prompting us to examine its potential as an FGFR inhibitor. In Ba/F3 cells engineered to express activated FGFR1-4, ponatinib potently inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling and viability with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L, with substantial selectivity over parental Ba/F3 cells. In a panel of 14 cell lines representing multiple tumor types (endometrial, bladder, gastric, breast, lung, and colon) and containing FGFRs dysregulated by a variety of mechanisms, ponatinib inhibited FGFR-mediated signaling with IC(50) values <40 nmol/L and inhibited cell growth with GI(50) (concentration needed to reduce the growth of treated cells to half that of untreated cells) values of 7 to 181 nmol/L. Daily oral dosing of ponatinib (10-30 mg/kg) to mice reduced tumor growth and inhibited signaling in all three tumor models examined. Importantly, the potency of ponatinib in these models is similar to that previously observed in BCR-ABL-driven models and plasma levels of ponatinib that exceed the IC(50) values for FGFR1-4 inhibition can be sustained in patients. These results show that ponatinib is a potent pan-FGFR inhibitor and provide strong rationale for its evaluation in patients with FGFR-driven cancers.",cancer
697,Activity of the oral MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with advanced melanoma: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial.,"MEK is a member of the MAPK signalling cascade that is commonly activated in melanoma. Direct inhibition of MEK blocks cell proliferation and induces apoptosis. We aimed to analyse safety, efficacy, and genotyping data for the oral, small-molecule MEK inhibitor trametinib in patients with melanoma. We undertook a multicentre, phase 1 three-part study (dose escalation, cohort expansion, and pharmacodynamic assessment). The main results of this study are reported elsewhere; here we present data relating to patients with melanoma. We obtained tumour samples to assess BRAF mutational status, and available tissues underwent exploratory genotyping analysis. Disease response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, and adverse events were defined by common toxicity criteria. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. 97 patients with melanoma were enrolled, including 81 with cutaneous or unknown primary melanoma (36 BRAF mutant, 39 BRAF wild-type, six BRAF status unknown), and 16 with uveal melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=80; 82%) and diarrhoea (44; 45%), most of which were grade 2 or lower. No cutaneous squamous-cell carcinomas were recorded. Of 36 patients with BRAF mutations, 30 had not received a BRAF inhibitor before; two complete responses (both confirmed) and ten partial responses (eight confirmed) were noted in this subgroup (confirmed response rate, 33%). Median progression-free survival of this subgroup was 5·7 months (95% CI 4·0-7·4). Of the six patients who had received previous BRAF inhibition, one unconfirmed partial response was recorded. Of 39 patients with BRAF wild-type melanoma, four partial responses were confirmed (confirmed response rate, 10%). Our data show substantial clinical activity of trametinib in melanoma and suggest that MEK is a valid therapeutic target. Differences in response rates according to mutations indicate the importance of mutational analyses in the future. GlaxoSmithKline.",cancer

A study from a large veteran affairs hospital.,"Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are group of chronic inflammatory illnesses with a remitting and relapsing course that may result in appreciable morbidity and high medical costs secondary to repeated hospitalizations. The study's objectives were to identify the reasons for hospitalization among patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, and compare inpatient courses and readmission rates for IBD-related admissions versus non-IBD-related admissions.|A retrospective chart review was performed on all patients with IBD admitted to the Minneapolis VA Medical Center between September 2010 and September 2012.|A total of 111 patients with IBD were admitted during the 2-year study period. IBD flares/complications accounted for 36.9 % of the index admissions. Atherothrombotic events comprised the second most common cause of admissions (14.4 %) in IBD patients. Patients with an index admission directly related to IBD were significantly younger and had developed IBD more recently. Unsurprisingly, the IBD admission group had significantly more gastrointestinal endoscopies and abdominal surgeries, and was more likely to be started on medication for IBD during the index stay. The median length of stay (LOS) for the index hospitalization for an IBD flare or complication was 4 (2-8) days compared with 2 (1-4) days for the other patients (P = 0.001). A smaller percentage of the group admitted for an IBD flare/complication had a shorter ICU stay compared with the other patients (9.8 % vs. 15.7 %, respectively); however, their ICU LOSs tended to be longer (4.5 vs. 2.0 days, respectively, P = 0.17). Compared to the other admission types, an insignificantly greater percentage of the group whose index admission was related to an IBD flare or complication had at least one readmission within 6 months of discharge (29 % versus 21 %; P = 0.35). The rate of admission was approximately 80 % greater in the group whose index admission was related to an IBD flare or complication compared to the other types of admission (rate ratio 1.8, 95 % confidence interval 0.96 to 3.4), although this difference did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.07).|Identifying the reasons for the patients' index admission, IBD flares versus all other causes, may provide valuable information concerning admission care and the subsequent admission history.",nonCancer
244,SF3B1 mutations in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"SF3B1 is a critical component of the splicing machinery, which catalyzes the removal of introns from precursor messenger RNA (mRNA). Next-generation sequencing studies have identified mutations in SF3B1 in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) at high frequency. In CLL, SF3B1 mutation is associated with more aggressive disease and shorter survival, and recent studies suggest that it can be incorporated into prognostic schema to improve the prediction of disease progression. Mutations in SF3B1 are predominantly subclonal genetic events in CLL, and hence are likely later events in the progression of CLL. Evidence of altered pre-mRNA splicing has been detected in CLL cases with SF3B1 mutations. Although the causative link between SF3B1 mutation and CLL pathogenesis remains unclear, several lines of evidence suggest SF3B1 mutation might be linked to genomic stability and epigenetic modification.",cancer
964,"Durable Response to Crizotinib in a MET-Amplified, KRAS-Mutated Carcinoma of Unknown Primary.","Carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) accounts for 3-5% of all adult solid tumors. An extensive search for the anatomic site of origin is often undertaken in an attempt to tailor systemic treatment, but the latter often has limited efficacy - especially in the setting of an initial treatment failure. Molecularly targeted therapy is an emerging approach that may offer greater efficacy and less toxicity but is most likely to be effective when pairing a tumor harboring a sensitizing genomic alteration with an agent directed at the altered gene product. We report a patient with a CUP harboring a MET amplification with a complete metabolic response to crizotinib despite also harboring a KRAS mutation. Ge-nomic profiling was performed using a clinical next-generation-sequencing-based assay, FoundationOne(®), in a CAP-accredited laboratory certified by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge, Mass., USA). The CUP harbored both MET amplification (16 copies) and a KRAS G12V mutation. The patient was treated with crizotinib, a MET inhibitor, and has experienced a complete normalization of tumor metabolic activity for more than 19 months. Genomic profiling of CUP may reveal clinically meaningful genomic alterations that can guide targeted therapy decision-making. The use of this approach should be studied prospectively as a strategy for the effective treatment of CUP patients and for avoiding resource-intensive workups to identify the tumor site of origin.",cancer
2441,Targeted silencing of CXCR4 inhibits epithelial-mesenchymal transition in oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"Aberrant overexpression of C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) is a critical event during tumor metastasis. It has been previously reported that the expression of CXCR4 is linked with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissues derived from patients. The present study addresses the role of CXCR4 in EMT in tongue squamous cell carcinoma (TSCCA) cells in vitro and in xenograft models. Small interfering (si) RNA sequences targeting the CXCR4 gene were transfected into TSCCA cells. Cell migration, invasion, apoptosis and EMT markers were determined in TSCCA cells using wound healing and Transwell assays, Annexin V/propdidum iodide double staining and western blot analysis, respectively. In vivo, tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of cells into BALB/c nude mice. Phenotypic EMT markers and regulatory factors were detected in the tumor tissues derived from the mice. In vitro, silencing of CXCR4 expression suppressed cell migration and invasion, and induced apoptosis. The protein expression of the EMT-associated markers N-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinases 2/9 were attenuated, while E-cadherin was increased. In vivo, CXCR4 siRNA inhibited tumor growth, and EMT-associated proteins had similar expression patterns to the experimental results observed in vitro. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that CXCR4 silencing suppressed EMT in OSCC, thus affecting tumor metastasis.",nonCancer
284,Polymorphisms in XRCC1 and XPG and response to platinum-based chemotherapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients.,"Platinum-based chemotherapeutics is the most common regimens for advanced NSCLC patients. However, it is difficult to identify platinum resistance in clinical treatment. Genetic factors are thought to represent important determinants of drug efficacy. In this study, we investigated whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in Xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) and X-ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1) were associated with the tumor response in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy in Chinese population. Totally 82 patients with advanced NSCLC were routinely treated with cisplatin or carboplatin-based chemotherapy, and clinical response was evaluated after 2-3 cycles. And 3D (three dimensions) polyacrylamide gel-based DNA microarray method was used to evaluate the genotypes of XRCC1 194 Arg/Trp, XRCC1 399Arg/Gln, XPG 46His/His and XPG 1104His/Asp in DNA from peripheral lymphocytes. We found that there was a significantly increased chance of treatment response to platinum-based chemotherapy with the XRCC1 194Arg/Trp genotype (odds ratio 0.429; 95% CI 0.137-1.671; P=0.035). The polymorphism of XPG 46His/His was found to be associated with clinical response in NSCLC patients P=0.047, not detected between chemotherapy response and SNPs of XRCC1 399Arg/Gln or XPG 1104His/Asp (P=0.997 0.561, respectively). Our study showed that the polymorphic status of XRCC1 194Arg/Trp might be a predictive marker of treatment response for advanced NSCLC patients and those of XPG His46His was associated with susceptibility of chemotherapy. The 3D polyacrylamide gel-based DNA microarray method was accurate, high-throughput and inexpensive, especially suitable for a large scale of SNP genotyping in population.",cancer
248,TERT promoter mutations in primary and secondary glioblastomas.,"Telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) is up-regulated in a variety of human neoplasms. Mutations in the core promoter region of the TERT gene, which increases promoter activity, have been reported in melanomas and a variety of human neoplasms, including gliomas. In the present study, we screened for TERT promoter mutations by direct DNA sequencing in a population-based collection of 358 glioblastomas. TERT promoter mutations (C228T, C250T) were detected in 55 % glioblastomas analysed. Of these, 73 % had a C228T mutation, and 27 % had a C250T mutation; only one glioblastoma had both C228T and C250T mutations. TERT promoter mutations were significantly more frequent in primary (IDH1 wild-type) glioblastomas (187/322; 58 %) than in secondary (IDH1 mutated) glioblastomas (10/36, 28 %; P = 0.0056). They showed significant inverse correlations with IDH1 mutations (P = 0.0056) and TP53 mutations (P = 0.043), and a significant positive correlation with EGFR amplification (P = 0.048). Glioblastoma patients with TERT mutations showed a shorter survival than those without TERT mutations in univariate analysis (median, 9.3 vs. 10.5 months; P = 0.015) and multivariate analysis after adjusting for age and gender (HR 1.38, 95 % CI 1.01-1.88, P = 0.041). However, TERT mutations had no significant impact on patients' survival in multivariate analysis after further adjusting for other genetic alterations, or when primary and secondary glioblastomas were separately analysed. These results suggest that the prognostic value of TERT mutations for poor survival is largely due to their inverse correlation with IDH1 mutations, which are a significant prognostic marker of better survival in patients with secondary glioblastomas.",cancer
548,Long-Term ERK Inhibition in KRAS-Mutant Pancreatic Cancer Is Associated with MYC Degradation and Senescence-like Growth Suppression.,"Induction of compensatory mechanisms and ERK reactivation has limited the effectiveness of Raf and MEK inhibitors in RAS-mutant cancers. We determined that direct pharmacologic inhibition of ERK suppressed the growth of a subset of KRAS-mutant pancreatic cancer cell lines and that concurrent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibition caused synergistic cell death. Additional combinations that enhanced ERK inhibitor action were also identified. Unexpectedly, long-term treatment of sensitive cell lines caused senescence, mediated in part by MYC degradation and p16 reactivation. Enhanced basal PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling was associated with de novo resistance to ERK inhibitor, as were other protein kinases identified by kinome-wide siRNA screening and a genetic gain-of-function screen. Our findings reveal distinct consequences of inhibiting this kinase cascade at the level of ERK.",cancer
937,Heterogeneity of resistance mutations detectable by nextgeneration sequencing in TKI-treated lung adenocarcinoma.,"EGFR-mutated lung adenocarcinomas routinely develop resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). To better characterize the relative frequencies of the resistance mechanisms, we analyzed 48 EGFR-mutated TKI-resistant specimens from 41 patients. Next-generation sequencing of post-treatment specimens detected EGFR p.T790M in 31 (79%) of 39 patients, PIK3CA mutations in 10 (26%), EGFR p.S768_V769delinsIL in one, and KRAS p.G12C in one. Five PIK3CA mutations were outside of codons 542, 545, and 1047. Three of four pre-treatment specimens did not carry the PIK3CA mutation found in the post-treatment sample. Small cell carcinoma transformation was identified in four patients; none had p.T790M, including two where p.T790M was identified in the co-existing adenocarcinoma. In p.T790M-mutated specimens, the allele frequency was less than 5% in 24% of cases. p.T790M allele frequency was usually lower than that of the sensitizing mutation indicating that the resistance mutation was present either in a subset of cells or, if the sensitizing mutation was amplified, in a subset of the sensitizing alleles of a dominant clone. Eight patients had multiple resistance mutations, suggesting either multiple separate resistant clones or a single clone harboring multiple resistance mechanisms. PIK3CA mutations appear to be a more significant resistance mechanism than previously recognized.",cancer
1026,CHEK2 mutation and risk of prostate cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"CHEK2 encodes for a G2 checkpoint kinase which plays a critical role in DNA repair. Its mutation confers an increased risk of breast cancer. It has also been suggested to increase risks of prostate cancer, but its involvement with this type of cancer has not been confirmed. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between CHEK2 1100delC, IVS2+1G>A, I157T mutation and risk of Prostate Cancer. A comprehensive, computerized literature search of PubMed until December 27, 2014 was carried out. Eligible studies were included according to specific inclusion criteria. Pooled hazard ratio was estimated using the fixed effects model or random effects model according to heterogeneity between studies. Eight eligible studies were included in the analysis, all were retrospective studies. The overall meta-analysis demonstrated that the CHEK2 1100delC mutation (OR 3.29; 95% confidence interval: 1.85-5.85; P = 0.00) and I157T missense mutation (OR 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.51-2.14; P = 0.00) was associated with higher risk of Prostate Cancer, and CHEK2 1100delC mutation is irrelevant to familial aggregation phenomenon of prostate cancer (OR 1.59; 95% confidence interval: 0.79-3.20; P = 0.20). The IVS2+1G>A mutation is also irrelevant to Prostate Cancer (OR = 1.59, 95% CI = 0.93-2.71, P = 0.09). None of the single studies materially altered the original results and no evidence of publication bias was found. CHEK2 1100delC mutation and I157T missense mutation in males indicates higher risk of Prostate Cancer, but there's no evidence to prove the CHEK2 1100delC mutation was associated with Familial prostate cancer.",cancer

Consumers could benefit from novel FF formats such as refrigerated RTE (ready-to-eat) meals, a variety of fresh-like meat-, fish-, and egg-based products, fresh-cut fruits and vegetables, cereal-based fermented foods and beverages. To preserve these valuable commodities, mild biological (enzymatic treatment, fermentation and, bio-preservation) and engineering solutions are needed. The latter include nonthermal techniques such as high-pressure treatment, cook-chill, sous-vide, mirco-encapsulation, vacuum impregnation and others. ""De-constructive"" culinary techniques such as 3D food printing and molecular gastronomy as well as developments in nutrigenomics and digital technologies facilitate novel product formats, personalization and access to niche markets. In the operational sense, moving from nourishment to health improvement demands a shift from defensive market-oriented to offensive market-developing strategies including collaborative networks with research organizations.",nonCancer
1601,"Dialkylboron guanidinates: syntheses, structures and carbodiimide de-insertion reactions.","The synthesis of novel dialkylboron guanidinates is reported: the symmetrical compounds, (Me2N)C(NR)2BR'2 [R = (i)Pr, R' = Nrb (1); R = Cy, R' = Nrb (2); R = (i)Pr, R' = Cy (3); R = R' = Cy (4); R = 2,6-(i)Pr2-C6H3; R' = Cy (5); Nrb = exo-2-norbornyl] and the asymmetrically coordinated {(i)Pr(H)N}C(N(i)Pr)(NAr)BCy2 [Ar = Ph (6), 4-Me-C6H4 (7), 4-(t)Bu-C6H4 (8)] were prepared by the salt metathesis method from the appropriate lithium guanidinates and chloroboranes. Moreover, the bis(dicyclohexylboron)guanidinate(-2) {(i)Pr(Cy2B)N}C(N(i)Pr){N(4-(t)Bu-C6H4)}BCy2 (9) was also prepared from the corresponding dilithium guanidinate Li2[{N(4-(t)Bu-C6H4)}C(N(i)Pr)2] and ClBCy2. The structures of compounds 1, 3, 6 and 9 were confirmed by X-ray diffraction and all displayed a chelate coordination of the guanidinate ligand to the BR'2 fragment, the latter displaying an additional BCy2 attached to the exocyclic N atom. Solutions of compounds 1-4 reached an equilibrium with the aminoboranes Me2NBR'2 [R' = Nrb (10), Cy (11)] and the corresponding carbodiimides, which was slow at 25 °C. The thermodynamic parameters for these equilibria are also reported. The activation parameters for the equilibrium for compound 1 have been calculated after a kinetic study. Compounds 5-8, with one or two N-aryl fragments bound to a B centre, are more robust and need higher temperatures (80 °C) and prolonged times to give similar carbodiimide de-insertion reactions.",nonCancer
763,Activity of second-generation ALK inhibitors against crizotinib-resistant mutants in an NPM-ALK model compared to EML4-ALK.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor involved in both solid and hematological tumors. About 80% of ALK-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) cases are characterized by the t(2;5)(p23;q35) translocation, encoding for the aberrant fusion protein nucleophosmin (NPM)-ALK, whereas 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients carry the inv(2)(p21;p23) rearrangement, encoding for the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK fusion. The ALK/c-MET/ROS inhibitor crizotinib successfully improved the treatment of ALK-driven diseases. However, several cases of resistance appeared in NSCLC patients, and ALK amino acid substitutions were identified as a leading cause of resistance to crizotinib. Second-generation ALK inhibitors have been developed in order to overcome crizotinib resistance. In this work, we profiled in vitro the activity of crizotinib, AP26113, ASP3026, alectinib, and ceritinib against six mutated forms of ALK associated with clinical resistance to crizotinib (C1156Y, L1196M, L1152R, G1202R, G1269A, and S1206Y) and provide a classification of mutants according to their level of sensitivity/resistance to the drugs. Since the biological activity of ALK mutations extends beyond the specific type of fusion, both NPM-ALK- and EML4-ALK-positive cellular models were used. Our data revealed that most mutants may be targeted by using different inhibitors. One relevant exception is represented by the G1202R substitution, which was highly resistant to all drugs (>10-fold increased IC50 compared to wild type) and may represent the most challenging mutation to overcome. These results provide a prediction of cross-resistance of known crizotinib-resistant mutations against all second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) clinically available, and therefore could be a useful tool to help clinicians in the management of crizotinib-resistance cases.",cancer

Associations between memory specificity, avoidant coping, and stress.","Individuals higher on avoidant coping may remember fewer specific autobiographical memories and more nonspecific memories on the Autobiographical Memory Test (AMT) in order to protect themselves from the painful emotions accompanying some specific memories. Habitually remembering this way (overgeneral memory) may be a risk factor for depression. In Studies 1 and 2 (nondepressed samples), avoidant coping was associated with more specific memories and fewer overgeneral memories, at odds with the functional avoidance view. In Study 3 (depressed sample), there were no significant relationships between AMT indices and avoidant coping. Results are discussed in light of ironic process theory.",nonCancer
657,"Atezolizumab versus docetaxel for patients with previously treated non-small-cell lung cancer (POPLAR): a multicentre, open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial.","Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The anti-programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab is clinically active against cancer, including NSCLC, especially cancers expressing PD-L1 on tumour cells, tumour-infiltrating immune cells, or both. We assessed efficacy and safety of atezolizumab versus docetaxel in previously treated NSCLC, analysed by PD-L1 expression levels on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells and in the intention-to-treat population. In this open-label, phase 2 randomised controlled trial, patients with NSCLC who progressed on post-platinum chemotherapy were recruited in 61 academic medical centres and community oncology practices across 13 countries in Europe and North America. Key inclusion criteria were Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0 or 1, measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1), and adequate haematological and end-organ function. Patients were stratified by PD-L1 tumour-infiltrating immune cell status, histology, and previous lines of therapy, and randomly assigned (1:1) by permuted block randomisation (with a block size of four) using an interactive voice or web system to receive intravenous atezolizumab 1200 mg or docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) once every 3 weeks. Baseline PD-L1 expression was scored by immunohistochemistry in tumour cells (as percentage of PD-L1-expressing tumour cells TC3≥50%, TC2≥5% and <50%, TC1≥1% and <5%, and TC0<1%) and tumour-infiltrating immune cells (as percentage of tumour area: IC3≥10%, IC2≥5% and <10%, IC1≥1% and <5%, and IC0<1%). The primary endpoint was overall survival in the intention-to-treat population and PD-L1 subgroups at 173 deaths. Biomarkers were assessed in an exploratory analysis. We assessed safety in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01903993. Patients were enrolled between Aug 5, 2013, and March 31, 2014. 144 patients were randomly allocated to the atezolizumab group, and 143 to the docetaxel group. 142 patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and 135 received docetaxel. Overall survival in the intention-to-treat population was 12·6 months (95% CI 9·7-16·4) for atezolizumab versus 9·7 months (8·6-12·0) for docetaxel (hazard ratio [HR] 0·73 [95% CI 0·53-0·99]; p=0·04). Increasing improvement in overall survival was associated with increasing PD-L1 expression (TC3 or IC3 HR 0·49 [0·22-1·07; p=0·068], TC2/3 or IC2/3 HR 0·54 [0·33-0·89; p=0·014], TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 HR 0·59 [0·40-0·85; p=0·005], TC0 and IC0 HR 1·04 [0·62-1·75; p=0·871]). In our exploratory analysis, patients with pre-existing immunity, defined by high T-effector-interferon-γ-associated gene expression, had improved overall survival with atezolizumab. 11 (8%) patients in the atezolizumab group discontinued because of adverse events versus 30 (22%) patients in the docetaxel group. 16 (11%) patients in the atezolizumab group versus 52 (39%) patients in the docetaxel group had treatment-related grade 3-4 adverse events, and one (<1%) patient in the atezolizumab group versus three (2%) patients in the docetaxel group died from a treatment-related adverse event. Atezolizumab significantly improved survival compared with docetaxel in patients with previously treated NSCLC. Improvement correlated with PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on tumour cells and tumour-infiltrating immune cells, suggesting that PD-L1 expression is predictive for atezolizumab benefit. Atezolizumab was well tolerated, with a safety profile distinct from chemotherapy. F Hoffmann-La Roche/Genentech Inc.",cancer

We included studies if they used any patient-reported scale of hearing loss or tinnitus among children and AYAs with cancer or HSCT recipients. Only English language publications were included. Two reviewers identified studies and abstracted data.|There were 953 studies screened; 6 met eligibility criteria. All studies administered hearing patient-reported outcomes only once, after therapy completion. None of the studies described the psychometric properties of the hearing-specific component. Three instruments (among 6 studies) were used: Health Utilities Index (Barr et al., 2000; Fu et al., 2006; Kennedy et al., 2014), Hearing Measurement Scales (Einar-Jon et al., 2011; Einarsson et al., 2011), and the Tinnitus Questionnaire for Auditory Brainstem Implant (Soussi & Otto, 1994).

379,Levels of TGF-alpha and EGFR protein in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and patient survival.,"The most accurate predictor of disease recurrence in patients treated for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is, at present, the extent of regional lymph node metastasis. Since elevated levels of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and of its ligand, transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), have been detected in primary tumors of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, we determined whether tumor levels of these proteins were of prognostic importance. Monoclonal antibodies specific for EGFR and TGF-alpha were used for immunohistochemical detection of each protein in tissue sections of primary tumors from 91 patients who were treated by surgical resection. Levels of immunoreactive EGFR and TGF-alpha were quantified by use of a computerized image analysis system and were normalized to appropriate standards. The logrank test and proportional hazards regression analysis were used to calculate the probability that EGFR and TGF-alpha levels were associated with disease-free survival (i.e., no recurrence of cancer) and cause-specific survival (i.e., patients do not die of their disease). All P values were two-sided. When tumor levels of EGFR or TGF-alpha were analyzed as continuous variables, disease-free survival and cause-specific survival were reduced among patients with higher levels of EGFR (both P = .0001) or TGF-alpha (both P = .0001). In a multivariate analysis, tumor site, tumor level of EGFR, and tumor level of TGF-alpha were statistically significant predictors of disease-free survival; in a similar analysis, regional lymph node stage and tumor levels of EGFR and of TGF-alpha were significant predictors of cause-specific survival. Quantitation of EGFR and TGF-alpha protein levels in primary head and neck squamous cell carcinomas may be useful in identifying subgroups of patients at high risk of tumor recurrence and in guiding therapy.",cancer
353,Smoothened mutation confers resistance to a Hedgehog pathway inhibitor in medulloblastoma.,"The Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is inappropriately activated in certain human cancers, including medulloblastoma, an aggressive brain tumor. GDC-0449, a drug that inhibits Hh signaling by targeting the serpentine receptor Smoothened (SMO), has produced promising anti-tumor responses in early clinical studies of cancers driven by mutations in this pathway. To evaluate the mechanism of resistance in a medulloblastoma patient who had relapsed after an initial response to GDC-0449, we determined the mutational status of Hh signaling genes in the tumor after disease progression. We identified an amino acid substitution at a conserved aspartic acid residue of SMO that had no effect on Hh signaling but disrupted the ability of GDC-0449 to bind SMO and suppress this pathway. A mutation altering the same amino acid also arose in a GDC-0449-resistant mouse model of medulloblastoma. These findings show that acquired mutations in a serpentine receptor with features of a G protein-coupled receptor can serve as a mechanism of drug resistance in human cancer.",cancer
1293,A study of the transition between the non-polar and bipolar resistance switching mechanisms in the TiN/TiO2/Al memory.,"Thermochemical and electronic trapping/detrapping mechanism-based resistance switching in TiO2 is one of the most extensively researched topics in the field of resistance-switching random access memory (ReRAM). In this study, the subtle correlation between the formation and rupture of the Magnéli-based conducting filament (CF), which is the mechanism of non-polar thermochemical-reaction-based switching, and the electron trapping/detrapping at the defect centers, which is the mechanism of bipolar electronic switching, is examined in detail. The chemical interaction between the TiN top electrode and the TiO2 layer generates a stable and immobile electron trapping layer, which is called a ""switching layer"", whereas the thin region between the just-mentioned switching layer and the remaining Magnéli CF after the thermochemical reset comprises a non-switching layer. The seemingly very complicated switching behavior with respect to the bias polarity, compliance current, and detailed biasing sequence could be reasonably explained by the phenomenological model based on the combined motions of the CF, switching layer, and non-switching layer. Light-induced detrapping experiments further supplement the suggested switching model.",nonCancer
2037,Neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) promotes proliferation and migration as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is among the most malignant cancers worldwide, lacking biomarkers for subtyping and the reliable prognostication. Herein, we report a novel biomarker, NEU1 (neuraminidase 1), is up-regulated in most samples of HCC. The diagnostic value of NEU1 was evaluated by ROC, and the AUC (area under curve) reached 0.87 and 0.96 in two independent datasets, respectively. The survival differences of HCC patients with high or low expression of NEU1 were statistically significant, and a significant correlation between NEU1 expression and clinical information including stage, differentiation, AFP and embolus were observed. NEU1 expression, at both the mRNA and protein levels, were also higher in the portal vein tumor thrombus than tumor tissues. We also measured the proliferation and migration ability of two HCC cell lines following NEU1 interference and over-expression. Migration and proliferation rate were increased in NEU1 high expression groups. Moreover, gene expression studies identified pathways significantly associated with NEU1 expression. Among them, all the genes involved in spliceosomepathway were up regulated in NEU1-high group. In summary, our work identified NEU1 as a novel biomarker for both diagnosis and prognosis in HCC, and one of the most altered pathway of NEU1 is spliceosome.",nonCancer
718,Oncogenic BRAF Deletions That Function as Homodimers and Are Sensitive to Inhibition by RAF Dimer Inhibitor LY3009120.,"We have identified previously undiscovered BRAF in-frame deletions near the αC-helix region of the kinase domain in pancreatic, lung, ovarian, and thyroid cancers. These deletions are mutually exclusive with KRAS mutations and occur in 4.21% of KRAS wild-type pancreatic cancer. siRNA knockdown in cells harboring BRAF deletions showed that the MAPK activity and cell growth are BRAF dependent. Structurally, the BRAF deletions are predicted to shorten the β3/αC-helix loop and hinder its flexibility by locking the helix in the active αC-helix-in conformation that favors dimer formation. Expression of L485-P490-deleted BRAF is able to transform NIH/3T3 cells in a BRAF dimer-dependent manner. BRAF homodimer is confirmed to be the dominant RAF dimer by proximity ligation assays in BRAF deletion cells, which are resistant to the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib and sensitive to LY3009120, a RAF dimer inhibitor. In tumor models with BRAF deletions, LY3009120 has shown tumor growth regression, whereas vemurafenib is inactive. This study discovered oncogenic BRAF deletions with a distinct activation mechanism dependent on the BRAF dimer formation in tumor cells. LY3009120 is active against these cells and represents a potential treatment option for patients with cancer with these BRAF deletions, or other atypical BRAF mutations where BRAF functions as a dimer.",cancer

Advances in the understanding of the role of pyrin in the regulation of interleukin (IL)-1β activation, has led to use of anti-IL-1 agents for colchicine resistant FMF.|The authors performed a literature search of anti-IL-1 treatment for FMF, particularly canakinumab, a humanized IL-1β antibody, by searching PubMed/Medline/Scopus since 2001 and proceedings of major rheumatologic conferences since 2011 for unpublished studies.|Many reports of successful treatments with anti-IL-1 agents were published since 2007. In 2011, the first case reports of successful treatment with canakinumab were reported. Successful phase II trials reported in 2014 and 2015 led to a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial in patients with colchicine-resistant FMF. Significantly more canakinumab treated patients attained the very stringent primary outcome measure and secondary outcomes vs. those treated with placebo. The safety profile was similar to canakinumab trials for other indications. Canakinumab appears to be an excellent alternative for the vast majority of patients with colchicine resistant FMF with an adequate safety profile.",nonCancer
164,Cyclin E in human cancers.,Regulators of the cell cycle such as cyclin E play an important part in neoplasia. The cyclin E protein forms a partnership with a specific protein kinase. This complex phosphorylates key substrates to initiate DNA synthesis. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) are able to suppress the activity of cyclin E. Various substances (including proteins produced by oncogenic viruses) affect cyclin E directly or indirectly through an interaction with CKIs. These interactions are important in elucidating the mechanisms of neoplasia. They may also provide prognostic information in a wide range of common cancers. Cyclin E may even be a target for treatment of cancers in the future.,cancer

The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a vital role in tubular EMT process. The purpose of this study was to investigate the involved molecular mechanisms in TGF-beta-induced EMT and identify the potential role of glutathione S-transferase alpha 3 (GSTA3) in this process. The iTRAQ screening was performed to identify protein alterations of the rats underwent unilateral-ureteral obstruction (UUO). Protein expression of GSTA3 in patients with obstructive nephropathy and UUO rats was detected by immunohistochemistry. Protein and mRNA expression of GSTA3 in UUO rats and NRK-52E cells were determined by Western blot and RT-PCR. siRNA and overexpression plasmid were transfected specifically to assess the role of GSTA3 in RIF. The generation of ROS was measured by dichlorofluorescein fluorescence analysis. GSTA3 protein and mRNA expression was significantly reduced in UUO rats. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that GSTA3 expression was reduced in renal cortex in UUO rats and patients with obstructive nephropathy. Treating with TGF-β1 down-regulated GSTA3 expression in NRK-52E cells, which have been found to be correlated with the decreased expression in E-cadherin and megalin and increased expression in α-smooth muscle actin. Furthermore, knocking down GSTA3 in NRK-52 cells led to increased production of ROS and tubular EMT, whereas overexpressing GSTA3 ameliorated ROS production and prevented the occurrence of tubular EMT. GSTA3 plays a protective role against tubular EMT in renal fibrosis, suggesting GSTA3 is a potential therapeutic target for RIF.",nonCancer
2317,Experimental exposure to urban and pink noise affects brain development and song learning in zebra finches (Taenopygia guttata).,"Recently, numerous studies have observed changes in bird vocalizations-especially song-in urban habitats. These changes are often interpreted as adaptive, since they increase the active space of the signal in its environment. However, the proximate mechanisms driving cross-generational changes in song are still unknown. We performed a captive experiment to identify whether noise experienced during development affects song learning and the development of song-control brain regions. Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) were bred while exposed, or not exposed, to recorded traffic urban noise (Study 1) or pink noise (Study 2). We recorded the songs of male offspring and compared these to fathers' songs. We also measured baseline corticosterone and measured the size of song-control brain regions when the males reached adulthood (Study 1 only). While male zebra finches tended to copy syllables accurately from tutors regardless of noise environment, syntax (the ordering of syllables within songs) was incorrectly copied affected by juveniles exposed to noise. Noise did not affect baseline corticosterone, but did affect the size of brain regions associated with song learning: these regions were smaller in males that had been had been exposed to recorded traffic urban noise in early development. These findings provide a possible mechanism by which noise affects behaviour, leading to potential population differences between wild animals occupying noisier urban environments compared with those in quieter habitats.",nonCancer

In this large-scale, hospital-based, case-control study of 1817 PCa cases and 2026 cancer-free controls, we aimed to clarify the association between these two MTHFR variants and PCa risk in Shanghai and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. We found that both the heterozygous CT (adjusted OR = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.67-0.92) and the homozygous TT genotypes (adjusted OR = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.55-0.83) of c.677C>T were associated with a significantly decreased risk of PCa compared with homozygous wild-type CC genotype, respectively, using multivariate logistic regression. Furthermore, we confirmed that MTHFR c.677T allele was related to an increased serum homocysteine level in the Han Chinese population in Shanghai. In the cultured PCa cell lines, we observed that MTHFR c.677T could elevate the cellular homocysteine level and cause DNA damage, thus increasing cell apoptosis and finally inhibiting cell proliferation. In conclusion, MTHFR c.677T was a protective factor of PCa risk in ethnic Han Chinese males by inducing DNA damage and cell apoptosis.",cancer

Parathyroidectomy is the standard therapy for patients with PHPT. Our study included all patients with PHPT treated by parathyroidectomy at the Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University, China. Between 1998 and 2013, a total of 107 patients were recruited. Their clinical data, presentation, laboratory examinations, imageological diagnoses and surgical approaches were analyzed retrospectively. Eighty-four cases (78.5%) were followed up. During a median follow-up period of 5.7 years, a total of 80 patients were without recurrence and metastasis. The main symptoms of PHPT patients were palpable neck mass, joint pains and pathological fracture. The high levels of preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH) and serum calcium in PHPT patients decreased to below the normal upper limit within 3 days of surgery. The sensitivity of neck ultrasonography, sestamibi scanning, CT, MRI and the combination of three or four types of test were 86.0%, 90.4%, 80.8%, 79.6% and 96.1%, respectively. A 50% or greater drop in PTH levels within 20 min compared with the highest PTH levels before surgery occurred in 95/107 cases (88.8%). Transient hypocalcemia was the most common surgical complication. The ultrasonography and sestamibi scan is the most effective examination for parathyroid tumor. The 20 min PTH measurement appears to be extremely useful, and avoids unnecessary bilateral exploration.",nonCancer
2065,Low Childhood Cholesterol Absorption Predisposes to Gallstone Disease.

We hypothesized that certain properties of childhood cholesterol metabolism predict gallstone disease in adulthood.|Childhood serum cholestanol and plant sterols (surrogates for cholesterol absorption), cholesterol precursors (surrogates for cholesterol synthesis), lipids, demographics and dietary habits were compared between individuals diagnosed with gallstone disease subsequently in adulthood (n = 95) and control subjects (n = 190) matched for age, sex and body mass index (BMI) in 1980. Subjects were participants of prospective Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study.|In 1980, at mean age of 11.4 years' gallstone cohort was characterized by 5.8% lower cholestanol (p = 0.038), and 11.2% - 12.2% (p-range = 0.003-0.008) lower plant sterols campesterol, sitosterol and avenasterol compared to controls. Mean lathosterol/sitosterol ratio was 16.3% higher in gallstone versus control cohort (p = 0.028). Female gallstone group had 5.4% lower mean cholestanol compared to controls (p < 0.05), and, respectively, those of campesterol, sitosterol and avenasterol were 12.7-14.0% lower (p < 0.05 for each). BMI was inversely related to cholestanol and sitosterol (r-range = -0.161 - -0.208, p < 0.05 for each) in controls, but not among gallstone patients. In whole study population, surrogates of cholesterol absorption (e.g., campesterol, p = 0.018) and low dietary intake of vegetables (p = 0.009) were significant predictors of gallstones in logistic regression model.|Cholesterol metabolism trait characterized by low serum levels of surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption precedes adult gallstone disease already in childhood.

41,Immunohistochemistry for BRAF(V600E) antibody VE1 performed in core needle biopsy samples identifies mutated papillary thyroid cancers.,"BRAF(V600E) is the most frequent genetic mutation in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and has been reported as an independent predictor of poor prognosis of these patients. Current guidelines do not recommend the use of BRAF(V600E) mutational analysis on cytologic specimens from fine needle aspiration due to several reasons. Recently, immunohistochemistry using VE1, a mouse anti-human BRAF(V600E) antibody, has been reported as a highly reliable technique in detecting BRAF-mutated thyroid and nonthyroid cancers. The aim of this study was to test the reliability of VE1 immunohistochemistry on microhistologic samples from core needle biopsy (CNB) in identifying BRAF-mutated PTC. A series of 30 nodules (size ranging from 7 to 22 mm) from 30 patients who underwent surgery following CNB were included in the study. All these lesions had had inconclusive cytology. In all cases, both VE1 and BRAF(V600E) genotypes were evaluated. After surgery, final histology demonstrated 21 cancers and 9 benign lesions. CNB correctly diagnosed 20/20 PTC and 5/5 adenomatous nodules. One follicular thyroid cancer and 4 benign lesions were assessed at CNB as uncertain follicular neoplasm. VE1 immunohistochemistry revealed 8 mutated PTC and 22 negative cases. A 100% agreement was found when positive and negative VE1 results were compared with BRAF mutational status. These data are the first demonstration that VE1 immunohistochemistry performed on thyroid CNB samples perfectly matches with genetic analysis of BRAF status. Thus, VE1 antibody can be used on thyroid microhistologic specimens to detect BRAF(V600E)-mutated PTC before surgery.",cancer

We analysed 102 Swedish RCCs for VHL mutations by PCR-SSCP and sequencing. In 47 patients (46.1%), 70 different mutations were found, and most of them represented novel variations of the VHL gene. Mutations in the VHL gene were found in 54% of clear cell renal cell carcinomas (CCRCC) and in 18% of chromophilic cancers but in no chromophobe cancers or oncocytomas (P=0.016). Three novel hotspot or founder mutations were detected in our study: four CCRCCs carried a missense mutation (glutamic acid to lysine) at codon 160 which is critical in the stabilization of the H1 helix of the alpha domain and the alpha-beta domain interface in the VHL protein. Five CCRCCs and one chromophilic RCC harbored a 15-nucleotide in-frame deletion (codons 41-45) at a duplex tandem repeat sequence site. Moreover, this deletion was in linkage disequilibrium with a C-->T transition in the promoter region. The frequency of linkage was 17 times more common than chance. Five patients with this linked mutation resided in the same hospital district and at least three of them showed the two sequence variants in the tumor-adjacent tissue. In 5/6 patients the wild-type allele was lost in the tumor samples, suggesting a causal role for the mutations in RCC. These linked mutations might be novel polymorphisms maintained in a relative isolated population. Multiple mutations in VHL were found in 17 tumors out of 47 tumors with the VHL mutation. A higher multiple mutation detected rate (33%) was observed in grade 3 CCRCCs than those in grade 1 (22%) and grade 2 (9%) (P=0.04). This is evidence on the association between VHL mutation and extent of nuclear atypia.",cancer
800,Effect of crizotinib on overall survival in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring ALK gene rearrangement: a retrospective analysis.,"ALK gene rearrangement defines a new molecular subtype of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a recent phase 1 clinical trial, the ALK tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib showed marked antitumour activity in patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC. To assess whether crizotinib affects overall survival in these patients, we did a retrospective study comparing survival outcomes in crizotinib-treated patients in the trial and crizotinib-naive controls screened during the same time period. We examined overall survival in patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC who enrolled in the phase 1 clinical trial of crizotinib, focusing on the cohort of 82 patients who had enrolled through Feb 10, 2010. For comparators, we identified 36 ALK-positive patients from trial sites who were not given crizotinib (ALK-positive controls), 67 patients without ALK rearrangement but positive for EGFR mutation, and 253 wild-type patients lacking either ALK rearrangement or EGFR mutation. To assess differences in overall survival, we assessed subsets of clinically comparable ALK-positive and ALK-negative patients. Among 82 ALK-positive patients who were given crizotinib, median overall survival from initiation of crizotinib has not been reached (95% CI 17 months to not reached); 1-year overall survival was 74% (95% CI 63-82), and 2-year overall survival was 54% (40-66). Overall survival did not differ based on age, sex, smoking history, or ethnic origin. Survival in 30 ALK-positive patients who were given crizotinib in the second-line or third-line setting was significantly longer than in 23 ALK-positive controls given any second-line therapy (median overall survival not reached [95% CI 14 months to not reached] vs 6 months [4-17], 1-year overall survival 70% [95% CI 50-83] vs 44% [23-64], and 2-year overall survival 55% [33-72] vs 12% [2-30]; hazard ratio 0·36, 95% CI 0·17-0·75; p=0·004). Survival in 56 crizotinib-treated, ALK-positive patients was similar to that in 63 ALK-negative, EGFR-positive patients given EGFR TKI therapy (median overall survival not reached [95% CI 17 months to not reached] vs 24 months [15-34], 1-year overall survival 71% [95% CI 58-81] vs 74% [61-83], and 2-year overall survival 57% [40-71] vs 52% [38-65]; p=0·786), whereas survival in 36 crizotinib-naive, ALK-positive controls was similar to that in 253 wild-type controls (median overall survival 20 months [95% CI 13-26] vs 15 months [13-17]; p=0·244). In patients with advanced, ALK-positive NSCLC, crizotinib therapy is associated with improved survival compared with that of crizotinib-naive controls. ALK rearrangement is not a favourable prognostic factor in advanced NSCLC. Pfizer Inc, V Foundation for Cancer Research.",cancer
7,MEK1 mutations confer resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibition.,"Genetic alterations that activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) pathway occur commonly in cancer. For example, the majority of melanomas harbor mutations in the BRAF oncogene, which are predicted to confer enhanced sensitivity to pharmacologic MAP kinase inhibition (e.g., RAF or MEK inhibitors). We investigated the clinical relevance of MEK dependency in melanoma by massively parallel sequencing of resistant clones generated from a MEK1 random mutagenesis screen in vitro, as well as tumors obtained from relapsed patients following treatment with AZD6244, an allosteric MEK inhibitor. Most mutations conferring resistance to MEK inhibition in vitro populated the allosteric drug binding pocket or alpha-helix C and showed robust ( approximately 100-fold) resistance to allosteric MEK inhibition. Other mutations affected MEK1 codons located within or abutting the N-terminal negative regulatory helix (helix A), which also undergo gain-of-function germline mutations in cardio-facio-cutaneous (CFC) syndrome. One such mutation, MEK1(P124L), was identified in a resistant metastatic focus that emerged in a melanoma patient treated with AZD6244. Both MEK1(P124L) and MEK1(Q56P), which disrupts helix A, conferred cross-resistance to PLX4720, a selective B-RAF inhibitor. However, exposing BRAF-mutant melanoma cells to AZD6244 and PLX4720 in combination prevented emergence of resistant clones. These results affirm the importance of MEK dependency in BRAF-mutant melanoma and suggest novel mechanisms of resistance to MEK and B-RAF inhibitors that may have important clinical implications.",cancer
1839,In situ Raman spectroscopy study of metal-enhanced hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of VO2.,"Vanadium dioxide (VO2) has a phase transition from insulator to metal at 340 K, and this transition can be strongly modified by hydrogenation. In this work, two dimensional (2D) VO2 sheets have been grown on Si(1 1 1) surfaces through chemical vapor deposition, and metal (Au, Pt) thin films were deposited on VO2 surfaces by sputtering. The hydrogenation and dehydrogenation of VO2 and metal-decorated VO2 structures in H2 and in air were in situ studied by Raman. We found that hydrogenation and dehydrogenation temperatures have been significantly decreased with the VO2 surface decorated by Au and Pt. The enhanced hydrogenation and dehydrogenation reactions can be attributed to catalytic dissociation of H2 and O2 molecules on metal surfaces and subsequent spillover of dissociated H and O atoms to the oxide surfaces.",nonCancer
853,Personalized treatment of Sézary syndrome by targeting a novel CTLA4:CD28 fusion.,"Matching molecularly targeted therapies with cancer subtype-specific gene mutations is revolutionizing oncology care. However, for rare cancers this approach is problematic due to the often poor understanding of the disease's natural history and phenotypic heterogeneity, making treatment of these cancers a particularly unmet medical need in clinical oncology. Advanced Sézary syndrome (SS), an aggressive, exceedingly rare variant of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a prototypical example of a rare cancer. Through whole genome and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of a SS patient's tumor we discovered a highly expressed gene fusion between CTLA4 (cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) and CD28 (cluster of differentiation 28), predicting a novel stimulatory molecule on the surface of tumor T cells. Treatment with the CTLA4 inhibitor ipilimumab resulted in a rapid clinical response. Our findings suggest a novel driver mechanism for SS, and cancer in general, and exemplify an emerging model of cancer treatment using exploratory genomic analysis to identify a personally targeted treatment option when conventional therapies are exhausted.",cancer
2049,The Screw-Like Movement of a Gliding Bacterium Is Powered by Spiral Motion of Cell-Surface Adhesins.,"Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a rod-shaped bacterium, glides over surfaces at speeds of ∼2 μm/s. The propulsion of a cell-surface adhesin, SprB, is known to enable gliding. We used cephalexin to generate elongated cells with irregular shapes and followed their displacement in three dimensions. These cells rolled about their long axes as they moved forward, following a right-handed trajectory. We coated gold nanoparticles with an SprB antibody and tracked them in three dimensions in an evanescent field where the nanoparticles appeared brighter when they were closer to the glass. The nanoparticles followed a right-handed spiral trajectory on the surface of the cell. Thus, if SprB were to adhere to the glass rather than to a nanoparticle, the cell would move forward along a right-handed trajectory, as observed, but in a direction opposite to that of the nanoparticle.",nonCancer
1054,Recurrence and variability of germline EPCAM deletions in Lynch syndrome.,"Recently, we identified 3' end deletions in the EPCAM gene as a novel cause of Lynch syndrome. These truncating EPCAM deletions cause allele-specific epigenetic silencing of the neighboring DNA mismatch repair gene MSH2 in tissues expressing EPCAM. Here we screened a cohort of unexplained Lynch-like families for the presence of EPCAM deletions. We identified 27 novel independent MSH2-deficient families from multiple geographical origins with varying deletions all encompassing the 3' end of EPCAM, but leaving the MSH2 gene intact. Within The Netherlands and Germany, EPCAM deletions appeared to represent at least 2.8% and 1.1% of the confirmed Lynch syndrome families, respectively. MSH2 promoter methylation was observed in epithelial tissues of all deletion carriers tested, thus confirming silencing of MSH2 as the causative defect. In a total of 45 families, 19 different deletions were found, all including the last two exons and the transcription termination signal of EPCAM. All deletions appeared to originate from Alu-repeat mediated recombination events. In 17 cases regions of microhomology around the breakpoints were found, suggesting nonallelic homologous recombination as the most likely mechanism. We conclude that 3' end EPCAM deletions are a recurrent cause of Lynch syndrome, which should be implemented in routine Lynch syndrome diagnostics.",cancer

4,A germline JAK2 SNP is associated with predisposition to the development of JAK2(V617F)-positive myeloproliferative neoplasms.,"Polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis are myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) characterized by multilineage clonal hematopoiesis. Given that the identical somatic activating mutation in the JAK2 tyrosine kinase gene (JAK2(V617F)) is observed in most individuals with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, there likely are additional genetic events that contribute to the pathogenesis of these phenotypically distinct disorders. Moreover, family members of individuals with MPN are at higher risk for the development of MPN, consistent with the existence of MPN predisposition loci. We hypothesized that germline variation contributes to MPN predisposition and phenotypic pleiotropy. Genome-wide analysis identified an allele in the JAK2 locus (rs10974944) that predisposes to the development of JAK2(V617F)-positive MPN, as well as three previously unknown MPN modifier loci. We found that JAK2(V617F) is preferentially acquired in cis with the predisposition allele. These data suggest that germline variation is an important contributor to MPN phenotype and predisposition.",cancer
447,Effect of MRE11 loss on PARP-inhibitor sensitivity in endometrial cancer in vitro.,"To evaluate the frequency of MRE11/RAD50/NBS1 (MRN)-complex loss of protein expression in endometrial cancers (EC) and to determine whether loss of MRE11 renders the cancer cells sensitive to Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-inhibitory treatment. MRN expression was examined in 521 samples of endometrial carcinomas and in 10 cancer cell lines. A putative mutation hotspot in the form of an intronic poly(T) allele in MRE11 was sequenced in selected cases (n = 26). Sensitivity to the PARP-inhibitor, BMN673 was tested in colony formation assays before and after MRE11 silencing using siRNA. Homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair was evaluated by RAD51-foci formation assay upon irradiation and drug treatment. Loss of MRE11 protein was found in 30.7% of EC tumours and significantly associated with loss of RAD50, NBS1 and mismatch repair protein expression. One endometrial cell line showed a markedly reduced MRE11 expression due to a homozygous poly(T) mutation of MRE11, thereby exhibiting an increased sensitivity to BMN673. MRE11 depletion sensitizes MRE11 expressing EC cell lines to the treatment with BMN673. The increased sensitivity to PARP-inhibition correlates with reduced RAD51 foci formation upon ionizing radiation in MRE11-depleted cells. Loss of the MRE11 protein predicts sensitivity to PARP-inhibitor sensitivity in vitro, defining it as an additional synthetic lethal gene with PARP. The high incidence of MRE11 loss in ECs can be potentially exploited for PARP-inhibitor therapy. Furthermore, MRE11 protein expression using immunohistochemistry could be investigated as a predictive biomarker for PARP-inhibitor treatment.",cancer
1454,"Consensus paper of the WFSBP Task Force on Genetics: Genetics, epigenetics and gene expression markers of major depressive disorder and antidepressant response.","Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a heritable disease with a heavy personal and socio-economic burden. Antidepressants of different classes are prescribed to treat MDD, but reliable and reproducible markers of efficacy are not available for clinical use. Further complicating treatment, the diagnosis of MDD is not guided by objective criteria, resulting in the risk of under- or overtreatment. A number of markers of MDD and antidepressant response have been investigated at the genetic, epigenetic, gene expression and protein levels. Polymorphisms in genes involved in antidepressant metabolism (cytochrome P450 isoenzymes), antidepressant transport (ABCB1), glucocorticoid signalling (FKBP5) and serotonin neurotransmission (SLC6A4 and HTR2A) were among those included in the first pharmacogenetic assays that have been tested for clinical applicability. The results of these investigations were encouraging when examining patient-outcome improvement. Furthermore, a nine-serum biomarker panel (including BDNF, cortisol and soluble TNF-α receptor type II) showed good sensitivity and specificity in differentiating between MDD and healthy controls. These first diagnostic and response-predictive tests for MDD provided a source of optimism for future clinical applications. However, such findings should be considered very carefully because their benefit/cost ratio and clinical indications were not clearly demonstrated. Future tests may include combinations of different types of biomarkers and be specific for MDD subtypes or pathological dimensions.",nonCancer

2239,High tibial osteotomy in varus knees: indications and limits.,"Opening wedge high tibial osteotomy (OWHTO) is a surgical procedure that aims to correct the weight-bearing axis of the knee, moving the loads laterally from the medial compartment. Conventional indications for OWHTO are medial compartment osteoarthritis and varus malalignment of the knee; recently OWHTO has been used successfully in the treatment of double and triple varus. OWHTO, in contrast to closing wedge high tibial osteotomy, does not require fibular osteotomy or peroneal nerve dissection, or lead to disruption of the proximal tibiofibular joint and bone stock loss. For these reasons, interest in this procedure has grown in recent years. The aim of this study is to review the literature on OWHTO, considering indications and prognostic factors (body mass index, grade of osteoarthritis, instability, range of movement and age), outcomes at mid-term follow-up, and limits of the procedure (slope modifications, patellar height changes and difficulties in conversion to a total knee arthroplasty).",nonCancer
175,Mutations in residues of TP53 that directly contact DNA predict poor outcome in human primary breast cancer.,"The tumour-suppressor gene TP53 is frequently mutated in breast tumours, and the majority of the mutations are clustered within the core domain, the region involved in DNA binding. We searched for alterations in this central domain of the TP53gene in 222 human breast cancer specimens using polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation analysis (PCR-SSCA) followed by sequencing. TP53 gene mutations were observed in 66 tumours (31%), including three tumours that contain two mutations. Fifty-four (78%) of these mutations were missense point mutations, one was a nonsense mutation and four were deletions and/or insertions causing disruption of the protein reading frame, whereas four mutations were either silent or a polymorphism (at codon 213; n = 6). Interestingly, the majority of missense mutations were observed at codon 248. The outcome has been related with patient and tumour characteristics, and with prognosis in 177 patients who were eligible for analysis of both relapse-free and overall survival (median survival for patients alive was 115 months). There was no significant association between the frequency of TP53 mutations and menopausal or nodal status, or tumour size. In a Cox univariate analysis, TP53 gene mutation was significantly associated with poor relapse-free survival (RFS: P = 0.02) but not with overall survival (OS: P = 0.07). In a Cox multivariate analysis, including classical prognostic factors, TP53 gene mutation independently predicted poor RFS and OS (RHR = 1.8 and 1.6 respectively). Unexpectedly, the median relapse-free survival of patients with a polymorphism at codon 213 or with a silent mutation was shorter (median 11 months) than the median relapse-free survival of patients with or without a TP53 gene mutation (median 34 or 48 months respectively). In an exploratory subset analysis, mutations in codons that directly contact DNA were related with the poorest relapse-free (P < 0.05) and overall survival (P < 0.02). These data imply that in the analysis of the prognostic value of TP53, the type of mutation and its biological function should be considered.",cancer

400,ERCC1 as a Prognostic and Predictive Biomarker for Urothelial Carcinoma of the Bladder following Radical Cystectomy.,"ERCC1 is the key enzyme of the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which maintains genomic stability. ERCC1 has been proposed as a prognostic and predictive biomarker for patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder but there are limited data on patients after radical cystectomy. ERCC1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in radical cystectomy specimens of 432 patients. Associations with disease-free and cancer specific survival, and the effect of adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy were assessed. Further, ERCC1 mRNA expression and in vitro sensitivity to cisplatin were correlated in 25 bladder urothelial carcinoma cell lines. ERCC1 was expressed in 308 tumors (71.3%). There was no association with clinicopathological variables (each p >0.3). Median postoperative followup was 128 months. On multivariable analyses patients with ERCC1 positive tumors had significantly better disease-free survival (HR 0.70, p = 0.028) and cancer specific survival (HR 0.70, p = 0.032) than those with ERCC1 negative tumors. Discrimination of the multivariable models increased by 0.7% to 0.9% following the inclusion of ERCC1. There was no modification of the effect of adjuvant cisplatin based combination chemotherapy by ERCC1 status (p = 0.38 and 0.88, respectively). There was also no correlation between ERCC1 and sensitivity to cisplatin in vitro (R(2) = 0.02, p = 0.46). ERCC1 may be a prognostic biomarker for urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Patients with ERCC1 positive tumors may have better survival than those with ERCC1 negative tumors. However, the efficacy of adjuvant cisplatin based chemotherapy appears to be unrelated to ERCC1 status.",cancer

Trametinib is a selective, orally administered MEK1/MEK2 inhibitor. We aimed to define the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose of trametinib and to assess its safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and response rate in individuals with advanced solid tumours. We undertook a multicentre phase 1 study in patients with advanced solid tumours and adequate organ function. The study was in three parts: dose escalation to define the maximum tolerated dose; identification of the recommended phase 2 dose; and assessment of pharmacodynamic changes. Intermittent and continuous dosing regimens were analysed. Blood samples and tumour biopsy specimens were taken to assess pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes. Adverse events were defined with common toxicity criteria, and tumour response was measured by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00687622. We enrolled 206 patients (median age 58·5 years, range 19-92). Dose-limiting toxic effects included rash (n=2), diarrhoea (n=1), and central serous retinopathy (n=2). The most common treatment-related adverse events were rash or dermatitis acneiform (n=165; 80%) and diarrhoea (87; 42%), most of which were grade 1 and 2. The maximum tolerated dose was 3 mg once daily and the recommended phase 2 dose was 2 mg a day. The effective half-life of trametinib was about 4 days. At the recommended phase 2 dose, the exposure profile of the drug showed low interpatient variability and a small peak:trough ratio of 1·81. Furthermore, mean concentrations in plasma were greater than the preclinical target concentration throughout the dosing interval. Pathway inhibition and clinical activity were seen, with 21 (10%) objective responses recorded. The recommended phase 2 dose of 2 mg trametinib once a day is tolerable, with manageable side-effects. Trametinib's inhibition of the expected target and clinical activity warrants its further development as a monotherapy and in combination. GlaxoSmithKline.",cancer
958,Open-label phase III trial of panitumumab plus best supportive care compared with best supportive care alone in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Panitumumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). We compared the activity of panitumumab plus best supportive care (BSC) to that of BSC alone in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who had progressed after standard chemotherapy. We randomly assigned 463 patients with 1% or more EGFR tumor cell membrane staining, measurable disease, and radiologic documentation of disease progression during or within 6 months of most recent chemotherapy to panitumumab 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks plus BSC (n = 231) or BSC alone (n = 232). Tumor assessments by blinded central review were scheduled from week 8 until disease progression. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included objective response, overall survival (OS), and safety. BSC patients who progressed could receive panitumumab in a cross-over study. Panitumumab significantly prolonged PFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.54; 95% CI, 0.44 to 0.66, [P < .0001]). Median PFS time was 8 weeks (95% CI, 7.9 to 8.4) for panitumumab and 7.3 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 to 7.7) for BSC. Mean (standard error) PFS time was 13.8 (0.8) weeks for panitumumab and 8.5 (0.5) weeks for BSC. Objective response rates also favored panitumumab over BSC; after a 12-month minimum follow-up, response rates were 10% for panitumumab and 0% for BSC (P < .0001). No difference was observed in OS (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.82 to 1.22), which was confounded by similar activity of panitumumab after 76% of BSC patients entered the cross-over study. Panitumumab was well tolerated. Skin toxicities, hypomagnesaemia, and diarrhea were the most common toxicities observed. No patients had grade 3/4 infusion reactions. Panitumumab significantly improved PFS with manageable toxicity in patients with chemorefractory colorectal cancer.",cancer
1603,GnRH stimulates peptidylarginine deiminase catalyzed histone citrullination in gonadotrope cells.,"Peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) enzymes convert histone tail arginine residues to citrulline resulting in chromatin decondensation. Our previous work found that PAD isoforms are expressed in female reproductive tissues in an estrous cycle dependent fashion, but their role in the anterior pituitary gland is unknown. Thus, we investigated PAD expression and function in gonadotrope cells. The gonadotrope derived LβT2 cell line strongly expresses PAD2 at the protein level compared to other PAD isoforms. Consistent with this, PAD2 protein expression is highest during the estrus phase of the estrous cycle and colocalizes with the luteinizing hormone (LH) β subunit in the mouse pituitary. Using the GnRH agonist buserelin (GnRHa), studies in LβT2 and mouse primary gonadotrope cells revealed that 30 minutes of stimulation caused distinct puncta of PAD2 to localize in the nucleus. Once in the nucleus, GnRHa stimulated PAD2 citrullinates histone H3 tail arginine residues at sites 2, 8, and 17 within 30 minutes; however, this effect and PAD2 nuclear localization was blunted by incubation of the cells with the pan-PAD inhibitor, biphenyl-benzimidazole-Cl-amidine (BB-ClA). Given that PAD2 citrullinates histones in gonadotropes, we next analyzed the functional consequence of PAD2 inhibition on gene expression. Our results show that GnRHa stimulates an increase in LHβ and FSHβ mRNA, and that this response is significantly reduced in the presence of the PAD inhibitor BB-ClA. Overall, our data suggest that GnRHa stimulates PAD2 catalyzed histone citrullination in gonadotropes to epigenetically regulate gonadotropin gene expression.",nonCancer

2168,Modulation of glycogen synthase kinase-3β following TRAIL combinatorial treatment in cancer cells.,"Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3β (GSK3β) is a serine/threonine kinase, known to regulate various cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation, survival, apoptosis as well as TRAIL-resistance. Thus pathways that can modulate GSK3β axis are important targets for cancer drug development. Our earlier studies have shown that combinatorial treatment with Troglitazone (TZD) and TRAIL can induce apoptosis in TRAIL-resistant cancer cells. The current studies were undertaken to investigate whether GSK3β pathway was modulated during this apoptosis. Our results indicated an increase in inhibitory GSK3βSer9 phosphorylation during apoptosis, mediated via AKT. At a later time, however, TZD alone and TRAIL-TZD combination produced a dramatic reduction of GSK3β expression, which was abolished by cycloheximide. Luciferase assays with GSK3β-luc promoter reporter showed that TZD can effectively antagonize GSK3β promoter activity. Since TZD is a ligand for transcription factor PPARγ and can activate AMPK, we determined their roles on antagonism of GSK3β. Knockdown of PPARγ was unable to restore GSK3β expression or antagonize GSK3βSer9 phosphorylation. Although pretreatment with Compound C (pharmacological inhibitor of AMPK) partially rescued GSK3β expression, knockdown of AMPKα1 or α2 alone or in combination were ineffective. These studies suggested a novel PPARγ-AMPK-independent mechanism of targeting GSK3β by TZD, elucidation of which might provide newer insights to improve our understanding of TRAIL-resistance.",nonCancer

Here, we examine the translational potential of this observation. RICTOR was the most frequently amplified gene observed (~14% patients), and co-amplified with FGF10 and IL7R on chromosome 5p13. RICTOR copy number variation correlated with RICTOR protein expression in SCLC cells. In parallel, cells with RICTOR copy number (CN) gain showed increased sensitivity to three mTOR inhibitors, AZD8055, AZD2014 and INK128 in cell growth assays, with AZD2014 demonstrating the best inhibition of downstream signaling. SCLC cells with RICTOR CN gain also migrated more rapidly in chemotaxis and scratch wound assays and were again more sensitive to mTOR inhibitors. The overall survival in SCLC patients with RICTOR amplification was significantly decreased (p = 0.021). Taken together, our results suggest that SCLC patients with RICTOR amplification may constitute a clinically important subgroup because of their potential response to mTORC1/2 inhibitors.",cancer
1651,Comparison of efficacy and safety of topical versus intravenous tranexamic acid in total hip arthroplasty: A meta-analysis.,"The study aimed to compare the effectiveness and safety of topical versus intravenous (IV) tranexamic acid (TXA) for reducing blood loss in primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).|This systematic review and meta-analysis were performed according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement criteria. PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Chinese Biomedicine Literature (CBM), Wanfang Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Google Scholar were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs that compare topical versus IV-TXA administration for reducing blood loss during TKA from their inception to February, 2016. Meta-analysis was performed by Stata 12.0 software.|Seven studies comprising 2056 patients were included in this meta-analysis. No significant difference is found between topical TXA groups and IV-TXA groups regarding transfusion requirements (RR = 1.37, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.96-1.97, P = 0.083), total blood loss (MD 17.09, 95% CI: -33.74-67.91, P = 0.510), and hemoglobin decline (MD 0.32, 95%CI: -0.04-0.69, P = 0.122). Meanwhile, there is no significant difference in terms of the occurrence of deep venous thrombosis (RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 0.40-3.90, P = 0.869).|Topical TXA has a similar efficacy to IV-TXA in reducing both blood loss and transfusion rate without sacrificing safety in primary THA.",nonCancer

We developed the first regiodivergent [2,3]- and [1,2]-rearrangements of io-donium ylides that are controlled by copper catalysts bearing different ligands. In the presence of a 2,2'-dipyridyl ligand, diazoesters and allylic iodides react via a [2,3]-rearrangement pathway. Alternatively, a phos-phine ligand favors the formation of the [1,2]-rearrangement product. A series of α-iodoesters contain-ing a broad range of functional groups were obtained in high yields, regioselectivities, and diastereoselectivities.

623,CIP2A down regulation enhances the sensitivity of pancreatic cancer cells to gemcitabine.,"Cancerous inhibitor of protein phosphatase 2A (CIP2A) is an oncoprotein which participates in inhibiting tumor apoptosis in pancreatic cancer cells. Using immunohistochemical staining, we investigated the expression of CIP2A protein in 72 cases of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) tissue and 27 cases of adjacent normal pancreatic tissue. The positive rate of CIP2A protein expression in pancreatic cancer tissue was70.83 %, which was significantly higher than that in adjacent non- cancerous pancreatic tissue (11.11%). The expression of CIP2A was found to be correlated with TNM stage, but not correlated with age, gender, tumor location, smoking status, alcohol consumption, diabetes, high blood pressure, BMI, tumor size, lymph node metastasis or distant metastases. Kaplan- Meier survival analysis showed that patients with positive CIP2A protein expression had a lower overall survival rate than patients without CIP2A expression. COX regression analysis indicated that expression of CIP2A was an independent prognostic factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. In addition, down-regulation of CIP2A inhibited cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer cells by decreasing AKT signaling pathway. Our results indicated that down-regulation of CIP2A could be a novel therapeutic strategy for pancreatic cancer.",cancer
1225,Mutations in KIT occur at low frequency in melanomas arising from anatomical sites associated with chronic and intermittent sun exposure.,"In melanoma, mutations in KIT are most frequent in acral and mucosal subtypes and rarely reported in cutaneous melanomas particularly those associated with intermittent UV exposure. Conversely melanomas arising within chronic sun damaged skin are considered to harbour KIT mutations at higher rates. To characterize the frequency of KIT mutations in a representative melanoma population, 261 patients from two Australian melanoma centres were prospectively screened for mutations in exons 11, 13 and 17 of the KIT gene. A total of 257 patients had cutaneous melanoma arising from non-acral sites and four were acral melanomas. No mucosal or ocular melanomas were analysed. KIT mutations were identified in five tumours (2% of the entire cohort) including two acral melanomas. Two of the three non-acral melanomas with KIT mutations were associated with markers of chronic sun damage as assessed by the degree of skin elastosis. In the remaining cohort, 43% had chronically sun damaged skin. This report confirms that within an Australian population, KIT mutations are infrequent in cutaneous melanomas associated with both intermittent and chronic sun exposed skin.",cancer
640,A murine lung cancer co-clinical trial identifies genetic modifiers of therapeutic response.,"Targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy against specific subsets of molecularly defined cancers. Although most patients with lung cancer are stratified according to a single oncogenic driver, cancers harbouring identical activating genetic mutations show large variations in their responses to the same targeted therapy. The biology underlying this heterogeneity is not well understood, and the impact of co-existing genetic mutations, especially the loss of tumour suppressors, has not been fully explored. Here we use genetically engineered mouse models to conduct a 'co-clinical' trial that mirrors an ongoing human clinical trial in patients with KRAS-mutant lung cancers. This trial aims to determine if the MEK inhibitor selumetinib (AZD6244) increases the efficacy of docetaxel, a standard of care chemotherapy. Our studies demonstrate that concomitant loss of either p53 (also known as Tp53) or Lkb1 (also known as Stk11), two clinically relevant tumour suppressors, markedly impaired the response of Kras-mutant cancers to docetaxel monotherapy. We observed that the addition of selumetinib provided substantial benefit for mice with lung cancer caused by Kras and Kras and p53 mutations, but mice with Kras and Lkb1 mutations had primary resistance to this combination therapy. Pharmacodynamic studies, including positron-emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT), identified biological markers in mice and patients that provide a rationale for the differential efficacy of these therapies in the different genotypes. These co-clinical results identify predictive genetic biomarkers that should be validated by interrogating samples from patients enrolled on the concurrent clinical trial. These studies also highlight the rationale for synchronous co-clinical trials, not only to anticipate the results of ongoing human clinical trials, but also to generate clinically relevant hypotheses that can inform the analysis and design of human studies.",cancer
1186,ATM mutations uniformly lead to ATM dysfunction in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: application of functional test using doxorubicin.,"ATM abnormalities are frequent in chronic lymphocytic leukemia and represent an important prognostic factor. Sole 11q deletion does not result in ATM inactivation by contrast to biallelic defects involving mutations. Therefore, the analysis of ATM mutations and their functional impact is crucial. In this study, we analyzed ATM mutations in predominantly high-risk patients using: i) resequencing microarray and direct sequencing; ii) Western blot for total ATM level; iii) functional test based on p21 gene induction after parallel treatment of leukemic cells with fludarabine and doxorubicin. ATM dysfunction leads to impaired p21 induction after doxorubicin exposure. We detected ATM mutation in 16% (22 of 140) of patients, and all mutated samples manifested demonstrable ATM defect (impaired p21 upregulation after doxorubicin and/or null protein level). Loss of ATM function in mutated samples was also evidenced through defective p53 pathway activation after ionizing radiation exposure. ATM mutation frequency was 34% in patients with 11q deletion, 4% in the TP53-defected group, and 8% in wild-type patients. Our functional test, convenient for routine use, showed high sensitivity (80%) and specificity (97%) for ATM mutations prediction. Only cells with ATM mutation, but not those with sole 11q deletion, were resistant to doxorubicin. As far as fludarabine is concerned, this difference was not observed. Interestingly, patients from both these groups experienced nearly identical time to first treatment. In conclusion, ATM mutations either alone or in combination with 11q deletion uniformly led to demonstrable ATM dysfunction in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia and mutation presence can be predicted by the functional test using doxorubicin.",cancer
1302,Accessing relatively electron poor cerium(iv) hydrazido complexes by lithium cation promoted ligand reduction.,"A series of substituted N,N'-diarylhydrazines (ArNHNHAr), Ar = 3,5-(CH3)-C6H3; -Ph; 4-Cl-C6H4; 3,5-Cl-C6H3; 3,5-(CF3)-C6H3, were reacted with Ce(iii)[N(SiMe3)2]3 and lithiated bases to explore the use of Ce(iii) as a reductant and to evaluate the impact of the ligand substitution on the electronic structure at the cerium metal centre of the resulting complexes. The N,N'-diarylhydrazido ligands were coordinated by the Li(+) cation and then reduced by a Ce(iii) cation to form Li4(Et2O)4[Ce(IV)(ArNNAr)4] complexes in all cases. Stabilization of the resulting Ce(iv) product depended on the substituents on the N,N'-diarylhydrazido ligands. Isolable cerium products formed only with electron withdrawing substituents on the N,N'-diarylhydrazido rings, whereas electron donating substituents resulted in intractable mixtures of Ce(iii) products and N,N'-bis(aryl)diazenes (ArN[double bond, length as m-dash]NAr). The presence of electron withdrawing substituents at the N,N'-diarylhydrazido ligands formed relatively electron poor Ce(iv) complexes, which were probed by UV-Vis spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and DFT calculations. The Lewis acid promoted reduction of hydrazobenzene derivatives by Ce(iii) was thus demonstrated to be a successful method to access electron poor cerium(iv) complexes.",nonCancer
638,Mechanism of MEK inhibition determines efficacy in mutant KRAS- versus BRAF-driven cancers.,"KRAS and BRAF activating mutations drive tumorigenesis through constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway. As these tumours represent an area of high unmet medical need, multiple allosteric MEK inhibitors, which inhibit MAPK signalling in both genotypes, are being tested in clinical trials. Impressive single-agent activity in BRAF-mutant melanoma has been observed; however, efficacy has been far less robust in KRAS-mutant disease. Here we show that, owing to distinct mechanisms regulating MEK activation in KRAS- versus BRAF-driven tumours, different mechanisms of inhibition are required for optimal antitumour activity in each genotype. Structural and functional analysis illustrates that MEK inhibitors with superior efficacy in KRAS-driven tumours (GDC-0623 and G-573, the former currently in phase I clinical trials) form a strong hydrogen-bond interaction with S212 in MEK that is critical for blocking MEK feedback phosphorylation by wild-type RAF. Conversely, potent inhibition of active, phosphorylated MEK is required for strong inhibition of the MAPK pathway in BRAF-mutant tumours, resulting in superior efficacy in this genotype with GDC-0973 (also known as cobimetinib), a MEK inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials. Our study highlights that differences in the activation state of MEK in KRAS-mutant tumours versus BRAF-mutant tumours can be exploited through the design of inhibitors that uniquely target these distinct activation states of MEK. These inhibitors are currently being evaluated in clinical trials to determine whether improvements in therapeutic index within KRAS versus BRAF preclinical models translate to improved clinical responses in patients.",cancer

For the directly linked dyad, significant reduction is observed even in solvents of moderate ε, while for the dyad containing a 1,4-phenylene linker, reduction is more parallel to an increase in solvent ε. Bacteriochlorin dyads are promising candidates for development of environmentally responsive fluorophores and ROS sensitizers.",nonCancer

Previously untreated patients with EGFR mutation-positive stage IIIB or IV lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in LUX-Lung 3 (n=345) and LUX-Lung 6 (n=364). These patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive afatinib or chemotherapy (pemetrexed-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 3] or gemcitabine-cisplatin [LUX-Lung 6]), stratified by EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only). We planned analyses of mature overall survival data in the intention-to-treat population after 209 (LUX-Lung 3) and 237 (LUX-Lung 6) deaths. These ongoing studies are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00949650 and NCT01121393. Median follow-up in LUX-Lung 3 was 41 months (IQR 35-44); 213 (62%) of 345 patients had died. Median follow-up in LUX-Lung 6 was 33 months (IQR 31-37); 246 (68%) of 364 patients had died. In LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 28.2 months (95% CI 24.6-33.6) in the afatinib group and 28.2 months (20.7-33.2) in the pemetrexed-cisplatin group (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66-1.17, p=0.39). In LUX-Lung 6, median overall survival was 23.1 months (95% CI 20.4-27.3) in the afatinib group and 23.5 months (18.0-25.6) in the gemcitabine-cisplatin group (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.72-1.22, p=0.61). However, in preplanned analyses, overall survival was significantly longer for patients with del19-positive tumours in the afatinib group than in the chemotherapy group in both trials: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 33.3 months (95% CI 26.8-41.5) in the afatinib group versus 21.1 months (16.3-30.7) in the chemotherapy group (HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.36-0.79, p=0.0015); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 31.4 months (95% CI 24.2-35.3) versus 18.4 months (14.6-25.6), respectively (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.44-0.94, p=0.023). By contrast, there were no significant differences by treatment group for patients with EGFR Leu858Arg-positive tumours in either trial: in LUX-Lung 3, median overall survival was 27.6 months (19.8-41.7) in the afatinib group versus 40.3 months (24.3-not estimable) in the chemotherapy group (HR 1.30, 95% CI 0.80-2.11, p=0.29); in LUX-Lung 6, it was 19.6 months (95% CI 17.0-22.1) versus 24.3 months (19.0-27.0), respectively (HR 1.22, 95% CI 0.81-1.83, p=0.34). In both trials, the most common afatinib-related grade 3-4 adverse events were rash or acne (37 [16%] of 229 patients in LUX-Lung 3 and 35 [15%] of 239 patients in LUX-Lung 6), diarrhoea (33 [14%] and 13 [5%]), paronychia (26 [11%] in LUX-Lung 3 only), and stomatitis or mucositis (13 [5%] in LUX-Lung 6 only). In LUX-Lung 3, neutropenia (20 [18%] of 111 patients), fatigue (14 [13%]) and leucopenia (nine [8%]) were the most common chemotherapy-related grade 3-4 adverse events, while in LUX-Lung 6, the most common chemotherapy-related grade 3-4 adverse events were neutropenia (30 [27%] of 113 patients), vomiting (22 [19%]), and leucopenia (17 [15%]). Although afatinib did not improve overall survival in the whole population of either trial, overall survival was improved with the drug for patients with del19 EGFR mutations. The absence of an effect in patients with Leu858Arg EGFR mutations suggests that EGFR del19-positive disease might be distinct from Leu858Arg-positive disease and that these subgroups should be analysed separately in future trials.

1484,Genetic Diversity and Phenotypic Variation in an Introgression Line Population Derived from an Interspecific Cross between Oryza glaberrima and Oryza sativa.,"The introduction of closely related species genomic fragments is an effective way to enrich genetic diversity and creates new germplasms in crops. Here, we studied the genetic diversity of an introgression line (IL) population composed of 106 ILs derived from an interspecific tetra cross between O. glaberrima and O. sativa (RAM3/Jin23B//Jin23B///YuetaiB). The proportion of O. glaberrima genome (PGG) in the ILs ranged from 0.3% to 36.7%, with an average value of 12.32% which is close to the theoretically expected proportion. A total of 250 polymorphic alleles were amplified by 21 AFLP primer combinations with an average of 12 alleles per primer. Population structure analysis revealed that the IL population can be divided into four genetically distinct subpopulations. Both principal component analysis and neighbor-joining tree analysis showed that ILs with a higher PGG displayed greater genetic diversity. Canonical discriminant analysis identified six phenotypic traits (plant height, yield per plant, filled grain percentage, panicle length, panicle number and days to flowering) as the main discriminatory traits among the ILs and between the subpopulations and showed significant phenotypic distances between subpopulations. The effects of PGG on phenotypic traits in the ILs were estimated using a linear admixed model, which showed a significant positive effect on grain yield per plant (0.286±0.117), plant height (0.418 ± 0.132), panicle length (0.663 ± 0.107), and spikelet number per panicle (0.339 ± 0.128), and a significant negative effect on filled grain percentage (-0.267 ± 0.123) and days to flowering (-0.324 ± 0.075). We found that an intermediate range (10% - 20%) of PGG was more effective for producing ILs with favorable integrated agronomic traits. Our results confirm that construction of IL population carrying O. glaberrima genomic fragments could be an effective approach to increase the genetic diversity of O. sativa genome and an appropriate level of PGG could facilitate pyramiding more favorable genes for developing more adaptive and productive rice.",nonCancer

1986,Gels prepared from egg yolk and its fractions for tissue engineering.,"New biomaterials prepared from egg yolk and its main fractions (plasma and granules) have been developed for use in tissue engineering. Protein gels obtained via transglutaminase cross-linking were characterized by rheometry, texturometry and scanning electron microscopy. All the gels exhibited suitable physical and mechanical characteristics for use as potential biomaterials in skin regeneration. Specifically, results showed that these materials presented a compact, uniform structure, with granular gel being found to be the most resistant as well as the most elastic material. Accordingly, these gels were subsequently evaluated as scaffolds for murine fibroblast growth. The best results were obtained with granule gels. Not only adhesion and cell growth were detected when using these gels, but also continuous coatings of cells growing on their surface. These findings can be attributed to the higher protein content of this fraction and to the particular structure of its proteins. Thus, granules have proved to be an interesting potential raw material for scaffold development. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer
2492,Insights into the role of iron in immature rat model of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury.,"This study aimed to investigate the role of iron in the occurrence and development of hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) in immature rat models using 3-day-old Sprague Dawley rats. Normal control (NC), hypoxic-ischemic (HI), anemia, HI + ischemia, early iron treatment and late iron treatment groups were established. Rat brain tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and pathologically evaluated. Iron content and mRNA expression levels of iron regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) and transferrin receptor in the brain tissues were measured. Ultrastructural changes in the actin, microtubules, myelin and mitochondria of oligodendrocytes and axons were examined by electron microscopy. Numbers of viable myelin sheaths and oligodendrocytes in the periventricular area were also observed. Pathological damage of brain tissue in the HI group was markedly increased compared with that in the NC group. Furthermore, there was a higher iron content and reduced number of viable oligodendrocytes in the periventricular area of the HI group compared with the NC group. No significant difference in iron content was observed between the HI + anemia and NC groups. The number of viable oligodendrocytes in the HI + anemia group was increased compared with that in the HI group, and the number in the HI + anemia group with late iron treatment was lower compared with that in the NC group and increased compared with that in the HI + anemia group. Electron microscopy revealed a significantly higher number of myelin sheaths in the HI + anemia group than in the HI group. IRP2 mRNA expression levels in the brain tissues were significantly decreased in the HI + anemia group compared with the HI group. The results suggest that anemia may reduce the rate of increase of iron content of the brain following HI. However, the early occurrence of anemia may protect against HIBI.",nonCancer
1855,Previous midlife estradiol treatment results in long-term maintenance of hippocampal ERα levels in ovariectomized rats: Mechanisms and implications for memory.,"Ovariectomized rats that received previous administration of oestradiol in midlife display enhanced cognition and increased hippocampal levels of oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) months after oestradiol treatment ended as compared to ovariectomized controls. Objectives of the current work were to investigate mechanisms by which ERα levels are maintained following midlife oestradiol exposure and the role of ERα in memory in aging females in the absence of circuiting oestrogens. Unliganded ERα has increased interaction with the ubiquitin ligase, C terminus of Hsc-70 interacting protein (CHIP) leading to increased degradation of the receptor. In our first experiment, we tested the hypothesis that midlife oestradiol exposure in ovariectomized rats results in decreased interaction between CHIP and hippocampal ERα, leading to increased levels of ERα. Middle-aged rats were ovariectomized and received oestradiol or vehicle implants. After 40 days, implants were removed. One month later, rats were killed and hippocampi processed for whole protein western blotting and co-immunoprecipitation, in which ERα was immunoprecipitated from lysate. As expected, ERα protein expression was increased in rats previously treated with oestradiol compared to vehicle-treated rats. In rats treated with oestradiol, there was a decrease in CHIP-ERα interaction, suggesting that previous oestradiol treatment reduces interaction, slowing degradation of ERα. In a second experiment, we determined the impact on memory of antagonism of ER in the absence of circulating oestrogens. Rats were ovariectomized and implanted with oestradiol capsules. Capsules were removed after 40 days. Rats received chronic i.c.v. infusion of ER antagonist, ICI 182,780 or aCSF vehicle and were tested on a spatial memory radial maze task. Rats treated with ICI 182,780 had significantly worse performance (more errors). These experiments provide evidence that previous midlife oestradiol treatment maintains hippocampal ERα by decreasing its interaction with CHIP and that activation of these receptors provides cognitive benefits in the absence of circulating oestrogens.

338,Recurrent BRAF kinase fusions in melanocytic tumors offer an opportunity for targeted therapy.,"BRAF is the most prevalent oncogene and an important therapeutic target in melanoma. In some cancers, BRAF is activated by rearrangements that fuse its kinase domain to 5' partner genes. We examined 848 comparative genomic hybridization profiles of melanocytic tumors and found copy number transitions within BRAF in 10 tumors, of which six could be further characterized by sequencing. In all, the BRAF kinase domain was fused in-frame to six N-terminal partners. No other mutations were identified in melanoma oncogenes. One of the seven melanoma cell lines without known oncogenic mutations harbored a similar BRAF fusion, which constitutively activated the MAP kinase pathway. Sorafenib, but not vemurafenib, could block MAP kinase pathway activation and proliferation of the cell line at clinically relevant concentrations, whereas BRAF(V) (600E) mutant melanoma cell lines were significantly more sensitive to vemurafenib. The patient from whom the cell line was derived showed a durable clinical response to sorafenib.",cancer
445,Nuclear survivin expression: a prognostic factor for the response to taxane-platinum chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.,"Survivin, a structurally unique protein expressed in most common human neoplasms, is thought to support cell cycle progression and suppress apoptosis. Survivin expression is highly correlated with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and poor prognosis. In this retrospective study of banked pathology tissue of patients with advanced NSCLC, we tested for correlations of N-survivin expression in tumor tissues and responsiveness to treatment with platinum-based regimens containing paclitaxel or docetaxel. The 48 patients with NSCLC included 32 (66.7 %) males and 16 (33.3 %) females. Mean age at diagnosis was 59.4 years (range 36-83 years), and median follow-up time was 20.4 months (range 3.4-59.0 months). Patients with high tumor N-survivin expression had significantly better responses to taxane-platinum chemotherapy than those with low tumor N-survivin expression (P < 0.001). Adjusted multivariate modeling found high tumor N-survivin expression to be an independent prognostic factor for a clinical response to chemotherapy (high vs. low, OR 6.14, 95 % CI 1.62-23.29; P = 0.008). Median overall survival differed significantly between those with high tumor N-survivin expression who did/did not respond to chemotherapy and between those with low tumor N-survivin expression who did/did not respond to chemotherapy (P < 0.05). Tumor N-survivin expression shows promise as a predictive biomarker in the chemotherapy setting as a surrogate marker of high proliferation status.",cancer
1746,The Influence of the Dispersed Nanoparticles on Kinetics of Formation and Molecular Mass of Polyaniline.,"Using combination of open-circuit potential (OCP) and pH profiles of the aniline polymerization and their mathematical treatment, we develop the new convenient semi-quantitative approach to find influence of the dispersion of nanophase (on the example of TiO2 nanoparticles) on kinetic features of this process and molecular mass of the forming polyaniline. The results indicate that the reciprocal values of the duration of the induction period, of the homogeneous and heterogeneous pernigraniline (PN) accumulation, and of the PN reduction with aniline are the linear functions of the weight fraction of the nanoparticles. We find that when the nanoparticles are added, the weight-average molecular weight of PANI initially increases from 56 000 to 79 000 and the polydispersity index drops from 3.9 to 1.7. However, at high TiO2 concentrations, the former dramatically decreases while the latter arises. We use the relative proton concentration as the function of the time and the different extents of acceleration of the consecutive stages of the aniline polymerization to explain the changes of the molecular weight distribution of polyaniline (PANI) with different contents of TiO2 nanoparticles in polymerization medium.",nonCancer
1052,T-Cell Transfer Therapy Targeting Mutant KRAS in Cancer.,"We identified a polyclonal CD8+ T-cell response against mutant KRAS G12D in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes obtained from a patient with metastatic colorectal cancer.

However, one of these lesions had progressed on evaluation 9 months after therapy. The lesion was resected and found to have lost the chromosome 6 haplotype encoding the HLA-C*08:02 class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. The loss of expression of this molecule provided a direct mechanism of tumor immune evasion. Thus, the infusion of CD8+ cells targeting mutant KRAS mediated effective antitumor immunotherapy against a cancer that expressed mutant KRAS G12D and HLA-C*08:02.",cancer

POI affects 1% of women before age 40, and several genetic causes have been reported. To date, POI has been considered a monogenic disorder.|The aim of this study was to identify novel gene variations and to investigate if individuals with POI harbor mutation in multiple loci.|One hundred well-phenotyped POI patients were systematically screened for variants in 19 known POI loci (and potential candidate genes) using next-generation sequencing.|At least one rare protein-altering gene variant was identified in 19 patients, including missense mutations in new candidate genes, namely SMC1β and REC8 (involved in the cohesin complex) and LHX8, a gene encoding a transcription factor. Novel or recurrent deleterious mutations were also detected in the known POI candidate genes NOBOX, FOXL2, SOHLH1, FIGLA, GDF9, BMP15 and GALT. Seven patients harbor mutations in two loci, and this digenicity appears to influence the age of symptom onset.|Genetic anomalies in women with POI are more frequent than previously believed. Digenic findings in several cases suggest that POI is not purely monogenic disorder and points to a role of digenicity. The genotype-phenotype correlations in some kindreds suggest that a synergistic effect of several mutations may underlie the POI phenotype.",nonCancer
949,"Dual-targeted therapy with trastuzumab and lapatinib in treatment-refractory, KRAS codon 12/13 wild-type, HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer (HERACLES): a proof-of-concept, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial.","We previously found that dual HER2 blockade with trastuzumab and lapatinib led to inhibition of tumour growth in patient-derived xenografts of HER2-amplified metastatic colorectal cancer. In this study, we aimed to assess the antitumour activity of trastuzumab and lapatinib in patients with HER2-positive colorectal cancer. HERACLES was a proof-of-concept, multicentre, open-label, phase 2 trial done at four Italian academic cancer centres. We enrolled adult patients with KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) wild-type and HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer refractory to standard of care (including cetuximab or panitumumab), an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1, and at least one measurable lesion. We defined HER2 positivity in tumour samples by use of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in-situ hybridisation in accordance with our previously validated colorectal cancer-specific diagnostic criteria. Eligible patients received intravenous trastuzumab at 4 mg/kg loading dose followed by 2 mg/kg once per week, and oral lapatinib at 1000 mg per day until evidence of disease progression. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving an objective response (defined as complete response or partial response), which was assessed by independent central review in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with EudraCT, number 2012-002128-33. Between Aug 27, 2012, and May 15, 2015, we screened 914 patients with KRAS exon 2 (codons 12 and 13) wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer and identified 48 (5%) patients with HER2-positive tumours, although two died before enrolment. Of these patients, 27 were eligible for the trial. All were evaluable for response. At the time of data cutoff on Oct 15, 2015, with a median follow-up of 94 weeks (IQR 51-127), eight (30%, 95% CI 14-50) of 27 patients had achieved an objective response, with one patient (4%, 95% CI -3 to 11) achieving a complete response, and seven (26%, 95% CI 9-43) achieving partial responses; 12 (44%, 95% CI 25-63) patients had stable disease. Six (22%) of 27 patients had grade 3 adverse events, which consisted of fatigue in four patients, skin rash in one patient, and increased bilirubin concentration in one patient. No grade 4 or 5 adverse events were reported. We detected no drug-related serious adverse events. The combination of trastuzumab and lapatinib is active and well tolerated in treatment-refractory patients with HER2-positive metastatic colorectal cancer.

425,Expression of amphiregulin and EGFRvIII affect outcome of patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck receiving cetuximab-docetaxel treatment.,"Constitutive activation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a result of gene amplification, mutation, or overexpression of its ligands has been associated with response to EGFR targeting strategies. The role of these molecular mechanisms for the responsiveness of squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) to cetuximab-containing regimens remains unknown. Tumor biopsies from 47 patients, enrolled in a single-arm phase II multicenter study for second-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic SCCHN with cetuximab and docetaxel, were analyzed by immunohistochemistry for expression of EGFR, its deletion variant III (EGFRvIII) and its ligand amphiregulin (AREG). The relation between expression levels and disease control rate (DCR) was evaluated by logistic regression. Association between expression levels, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) was determined by Kaplan-Meier analysis, log-rank test, and uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis. High expression of EGFR, EGFRvIII, and AREG was detected in 73%, 17%, and 45% of SCCHN cases, respectively. Expression levels of EGFR had no impact on PFS or OS. High expression levels of EGFRvIII were significantly associated with reduced DCR and shortened PFS (HR: 3.3, P = 0.005) but not with OS. Patients with high AREG expression in tumor cells had significantly shortened OS (HR: 2.2, P = 0.002) and PFS (HR 2.2, P = 0.019) compared with patients with low expression score. Multivariate Cox analysis revealed an independent association of AREG and EGFRvIII with PFS but only AREG was an independent prognosticator of OS. High EGFRvIII and AREG expression levels identify SCCHN patients who are less likely to benefit from combination treatment with cetuximab and docetaxel.",cancer
1529,"Neotropical Zoonotic Parasites in Bush Dogs (Speothos venaticus) from Upper Paraná Atlantic Forests in Misiones, Argentina.","Wildlife remains an important source of zoonotic diseases for the most vulnerable groups of humans, primarily those living in rural areas or coexisting with forest. The Upper Paraná Atlantic forest of Misiones, Argentina is facing ongoing environmental and anthropogenic changes, which affect the local biodiversity, including the bush dog (Speothos venaticus), a small canid considered Near Threatened globally and Endangered locally. This project aimed to expand the knowledge of zoonotic parasites present in the bush dog and the potential implications for human health and conservation medicine. From May to August 2011, a detection dog located 34 scats that were genetically confirmed as bush dog and georeferenced to northern Misiones. Of these 34 scats, 27 had sufficient quantity that allowed processing for zoonotic parasites using morphological (sedimentation and flotation) and antigen (coproantigen technique) analyses. Within these 27 scats, we determined that the parasitic prevalence was 63.0% (n = 17) with 8 (47.1%) having mixed infections with 2-4 parasitic genera. No significant differences (p > 0.05) between sampling areas, sex, and parasite taxa were found. We were able to summarize the predominant nematodes (Ancylostoma caninum, Toxocara canis, and Lagochilascaris spp.), cestodes (Taenia spp. and Spirometra spp.), and apicomplexa (Cystoisospora caninum) found in these bush dogs. With the copro-ELISA technique, 14.8% (n = 4) of the samples were positive for Echinococcus spp. This study represents the first comprehensive study about parasitic fauna with zoonotic potential in the free-ranging bush dog. This information combined with the innovative set of techniques used to collect the samples constitute a valuable contribution that can be used in control programs, surveillance of zoonotic diseases, and wildlife conservation, both regionally and across the bush dog's broad distribution.",nonCancer
235,Effects on survival of BAP1 and PBRM1 mutations in sporadic clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma: a retrospective analysis with independent validation.,"Clear-cell renal-cell carcinomas display divergent clinical behaviours. However, the molecular genetic events driving these behaviours are unknown. We discovered that BAP1 is mutated in about 15% of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma, and that BAP1 and PBRM1 mutations are largely mutually exclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinicopathological significance of these molecular subtypes and to determine whether patients with BAP1-mutant and PBRM1-mutant tumours had different overall survival. In this retrospective analysis, we assessed 145 patients with primary clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma and defined PBRM1 and BAP1 mutation status from the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (UTSW), TX, USA, between 1998 and 2011. We classified patients into those with BAP1-mutant tumours and those with tumours exclusively mutated for PBRM1 (PBRM1-mutant). We used a second independent cohort (n=327) from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) for validation. In both cohorts, more than 80% of patients had localised or locoregional disease at presentation. Overall both cohorts were similar, although the TCGA had more patients with metastatic and higher-grade disease, and more TCGA patients presented before molecularly targeted therapies became available. The median overall survival in the UTSW cohort was significantly shorter for patients with BAP1-mutant tumours (4·6 years; 95% CI 2·1-7·2), than for patients with PBRM1-mutant tumours (10·6 years; 9·8-11·5), corresponding to a HR of 2·7 (95% CI 0·99-7·6, p=0·044). Median overall survival in the TCGA cohort was 1·9 years (95% CI 0·6-3·3) for patients with BAP1-mutant tumours and 5·4 years (4·0-6·8) for those with PBRM1-mutant tumours. A HR similar to the UTSW cohort was noted in the TCGA cohort (2·8; 95% CI 1·4-5·9; p=0·004). Patients with mutations in both BAP1 and PBRM1, although a minority (three in UTSW cohort and four in TCGA cohort), had the worst overall survival (median 2·1 years, 95% CI 0·3-3·8, for the UTSW cohort, and 0·2 years, 0·0-1·2, for the TCGA cohort). Our findings identify mutation-defined subtypes of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma with distinct clinical outcomes, a high-risk BAP1-mutant group and a favourable PBRM1-mutant group. These data establish the basis for a molecular genetic classification of clear-cell renal-cell carcinoma that could influence treatment decisions in the future. The existence of different molecular subtypes with disparate outcomes should be considered in the design and assessment of clinical studies.

760,Crizotinib-resistant mutants of EML4-ALK identified through an accelerated mutagenesis screen.,"Activating gene rearrangements of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) have been identified as driver mutations in non-small-cell lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, and other cancers. Crizotinib, a dual MET/ALK inhibitor, has demonstrated promising clinical activity in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer and inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors harboring ALK translocations. Inhibitors of driver kinases often elicit kinase domain mutations that confer resistance, and such mutations have been successfully predicted using in vitro mutagenesis screens. Here, this approach was used to discover an extensive set of ALK mutations that can confer resistance to crizotinib. Mutations at 16 residues were identified, structurally clustered into five regions around the kinase active site, which conferred varying degrees of resistance. The screen successfully predicted the L1196M, C1156Y, and F1174L mutations, recently identified in crizotinib-resistant patients. In separate studies, we demonstrated that crizotinib has relatively modest potency in ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer cell lines. A more potent ALK inhibitor, TAE684, maintained substantial activity against mutations that conferred resistance to crizotinib. Our study identifies multiple novel mutations in ALK that may confer clinical resistance to crizotinib, suggests that crizotinib's narrow selectivity window may underlie its susceptibility to such resistance and demonstrates that a more potent ALK inhibitor may be effective at overcoming resistance.",cancer
365,"Neratinib, an irreversible ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in patients with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer.","Neratinib is an oral, irreversible pan-ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The efficacy and safety of neratinib were evaluated in two cohorts of patients with advanced ErbB2-positive breast cancer-those with and those without prior trastuzumab treatment-in an open-label, multicenter, phase II trial. Patients in the two cohorts (prior trastuzumab, n = 66; no prior trastuzumab, n = 70) received oral neratinib 240 mg once daily. The primary end point was the 16-week progression-free survival (PFS) rate for the evaluable population (prior trastuzumab, n = 63; no prior trastuzumab, n = 64), as assessed by independent review. The 16-week PFS rates were 59% for patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 78% for patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment. Median PFS was 22.3 and 39.6 weeks, respectively. Objective response rates were 24% among patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and 56% in the trastuzumab-naïve cohort. The most common adverse events were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. Diarrhea was the most frequent grades 3 to 4 adverse event, occurring in 30% of patients with prior trastuzumab treatment and in 13% of patients with no prior trastuzumab treatment, which prompted dose reductions in 29% and 4% of patients, respectively, but treatment discontinuation in only one patient. No neratinib-related, grades 3 or 4 cardiotoxicity was reported. Oral neratinib showed substantial clinical activity and was reasonably well tolerated among both heavily pretreated and trastuzumab-naïve patients who had advanced, ErbB2-positive breast cancer. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect but was manageable with antidiarrheal agents and dose modification.",cancer
33,Age-related prognostic impact of different types of DNMT3A mutations in adults with primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.,"To determine the frequency of DNMT3A mutations, their associations with clinical and molecular characteristics and outcome, and the associated gene- and microRNA-expression signatures in primary cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). Four hundred fifteen previously untreated adults were analyzed for DNMT3A mutations and established prognostic gene mutations and expression markers. Gene- and microRNA-expression profiles were derived using microarrays. Younger (< 60 years; n = 181) and older (≥ 60 years; n = 234) patients had similar frequencies of DNMT3A mutations (35.3% v 33.3%). Missense mutations affecting arginine codon 882 (R882-DNMT3A) were more common (n = 92; 62%) than those affecting other codons (non-R882-DNMT3A). DNMT3A-mutated patients did not differ regarding complete remission rate, but had shorter disease-free survival (DFS; P = .03) and, by trend, overall survival (OS; P = .07) than DNMT3A-wild-type patients. In multivariable analyses, DNMT3A mutations remained associated with shorter DFS (P = .01), but not with shorter OS. When analyzed separately, the two DNMT3A mutation types had different significance by age group. Younger patients with non-R882-DNMT3A mutations had shorter DFS (P = .002) and OS (P = .02), whereas older patients with R882-DNMT3A mutations had shorter DFS (P = .005) and OS (P = .002) after adjustment for other clinical and molecular prognosticators. Gene- and microRNA-expression signatures did not accurately predict DNMT3A mutational status. DNMT3A mutations are frequent in CN-AML, and their clinical significance seems to be age dependent. DNMT3A-R882 mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in older patients, and non-R882-DNMT3A mutations are associated with adverse prognosis in younger patients. Low accuracy of gene- and microRNA-expression signatures in predicting DNMT3A mutation status suggested that the role of these mutations in AML remains to be elucidated.",cancer
827,A genome-scale RNA interference screen implicates NF1 loss in resistance to RAF inhibition.,"RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib and dabrafenib block BRAF-mediated cell proliferation and achieve meaningful clinical benefit in the vast majority of patients with BRAF(V600E)-mutant melanoma. However, some patients do not respond to this regimen, and nearly all progress to therapeutic resistance. We used a pooled RNA interference screen targeting more than 16,500 genes to discover loss-of-function events that could drive resistance to RAF inhibition. The highest ranking gene was NF1, which encodes neurofibromin, a tumor suppressor that inhibits RAS activity. NF1 loss mediates resistance to RAF and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitors through sustained MAPK pathway activation. However, cells lacking NF1 retained sensitivity to the irreversible RAF inhibitor AZ628 and an ERK inhibitor. NF1 mutations were observed in BRAF-mutant tumor cells that are intrinsically resistant to RAF inhibition and in melanoma tumors obtained from patients exhibiting resistance to vemurafenib, thus showing the clinical potential for NF1-driven resistance to RAF/MEK-targeted therapies.",cancer
253,"TP53 mutation is related to poor prognosis after radiotherapy, but not surgery, in squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.","TP53 gene-mutation and expression of p53 have been described to influence the radiosensitivity of tumour cells from head and neck carcinomas. The present study was performed to evaluate whether TP53 mutation may influence the clinical outcome of head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy or surgery. DNA was extracted from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections from primary biopsies taken before radiotherapy. Gene mutations (in exons 5-9) were identified using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) as the initial scanning procedure and characterized by sequencing. Patients were treated with primary radiotherapy or surgery alone. Treatment was given according to the DAHANCA schedules with 5 or 6 weekly fractions (2 Gy) of radiotherapy (66-68 Gy). Most patients were also treated with the hypoxic radiosensitizer Nimorazole. The results are reported as 5-year actuarial values, and differences estimated by log-rank analysis. The present analysis is based on 114 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx, pharynx and oral cavity diagnosed between March 1992 and October 1996. Ninety patients received primary radiotherapy alone and 21 were treated with surgery. TP53 mutations were found in 45 patients (39%) and in patients receiving radiotherapy, TP53 mutation was highly associated with poor prognosis. Loco-regional control rates (5-year actuarial values) for TP53 mutation was 29 vs. 54% for TP53 wildtype (P < 0.01). For disease-free survival the corresponding values were 13 and 38% (P < 0.01), respectively. The correlations were not found to be related to specific subtypes of mutations (e.g. missense mutations affecting DNA-contact or Zn-binding regions) but rather to the presence of any mutation at all. In contrast, TP53 mutation did not influence the response to surgery. A strong relationship was observed between TP53 mutation and poor prognosis (increased risk of loco-regional failure and death) in head and neck cancer patients given primary radiotherapy but not surgery.",cancer
2277,Characterization of A Three-Dimensional Organotypic Co-Culture Skin Model for Epidermal Differentiation of Rat Adipose-Derived Stem Cells.,"The organotypic co-culture is a well-known technique to examine cellular interactions and their roles in stem cell proliferation and differentiation. This study aims to evaluate the effects of dermal fibroblasts (DFs) on epidermal differentiation of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) using a three-dimensional (3D) organotypic co- culture technique.|In this experimental research study, rat DFs and ASCs were isolated and cultured separately on electrospun polycaprolactone (PCL) matrices. The PCL matrices seeded by ASCs were superimposed on to the matrices seeded by DFs in order to create a 3D organotypic co-culture. In the control groups, PCL matrices seeded by ASCs were placed on matrices devoid of DFs. After 10 days, we assessed the expressions of keratinocyte-related genes by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and expression of pan-cytokeratin protein by immunofluorescence in the differentiated keratinocyte-like cells from co- culture and control groups. Keratinocyte-like cell morphologies were also observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).|The early, intermediate, and terminal differentiation keratinocyte markers-Cytokeratin14, Filaggrin, and Involucrin significantly expressed in the co-culture groups com- pared to the control ones (P<0.05). We observed pan-cytokeratin in keratinocyte-like cells of both groups by immunofluorescence. SEM observation of the co-culture groups showed that the differentiated keratinocyte-like cells developed a polygonal cobblestone shape, considered characteristic of keratinocytes.|The 3D organotypic co-culture bilayered construct that consisted of DFs and ASCs was an effective technique for epidermal differentiation of ASCs. This co-culture might be useful for epidermal differentiation of stem cells for future applications in skin regeneration.",nonCancer
974,Further observations on LKB1/STK11 status and cancer risk in Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.,"Germline mutations in the LKB1/STK11 tumour suppressor gene cause Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare dominant disorder. In addition to typical hamartomatous gastrointestinal polyps and pigmented perioral lesions, PJS is associated with an increased risk of tumours at multiple sites. Follow-up information on carriers is limited and genetic heterogeneity makes counselling and management in PJS difficult. Here we report the analysis of the LKB1/STK11 locus in a series of 33 PJS families, and estimation of cancer risks in carriers and noncarriers. Germline mutations of LKB1/STK11 were identified in 52% of cases. This observation reinforces the hypothesis of a second PJS locus. In carriers of LKB1/STK11 mutations, the risk of cancer was markedly elevated. The risk of developing any cancer in carriers by age 65 years was 47% (95% CI: 27-73%) with elevated risks of both gastrointestinal and breast cancer. PJS with germline mutations in LKB1/STK11 are at a very high relative and absolute risk of multiple gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal cancers. To obtain precise estimates of risk associated with PJS requires further studies of genotype-phenotype especially with respect to LKB1/STK11 negative cases, as this group is likely to be heterogeneous.",cancer
1190,Prognostic significance of K-ras codon 12 mutations in patients with resected stage I and II non-small-cell lung cancer.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic importance of codon 12 K-ras mutations in patients with early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We identified 260 patients with surgically resected stage I (n = 193) and stage II (n = 67) NSCLC with at least a 5-year follow-up. We performed polymerase chain reaction analysis of DNA obtained from paraffin-embedded NSCLC tissue, using mutation-specific probes for codon 12 K-ras. K-ras mutations were detected in 35 of 213 assessable specimens (16.4%). K-ras mutations were detected in 27 of 93 adenocarcinomas (29.0%), one of 61 squamous cell carcinomas (1.6%), five of 39 large-cell carcinomas (12.8%), and two of 20 adenosquamous carcinomas (10%) (P = .001). G to T transversions accounted for 71% of the mutations. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival for all patients with K-ras mutations (median survival, 39 months) compared with patients without K-ras mutations (median survival, 53 months; P = .33). There was no statistically significant difference in overall or disease-free survival for subgroups with stage I disease, adenocarcinoma, or non-squamous cell carcinoma or for specific amino acid substitutions. The median survival time for stage II patients with K-ras mutations was 13 months, compared with 38 months for patients without K-ras mutations (P = .03). Codon 12 K-ras mutations were more common in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell carcinomas. For the subgroup with stage II NSCLC, there was a statistically significant adverse effect on survival for the presence of K-ras mutations. However, when the entire group was considered, the presence of K-ras mutations was not of prognostic significance in this cohort of patients with resected early-stage NSCLC.",cancer
1574,Raman and infrared study of 4f electron-phonon coupling in HoVO3.,"First-order Raman scattering and multiphonons are studied in RVO3 (R  =  Ho and Y) as a function of temperature in the orthorhombic and monoclinic phases. Raman spectra of HoVO3 and YVO3 unveil similar features since both compounds have nearly identical R-radii. However, the most important difference lies in the transition temperature involving the V(3+) orbitals, the V(3+) magnetic moments as well as the crystallographic structure. Particularly, the magnetic and orbital reorientations occur at T N2  =  40 K for HoVO3 instead T N2  =77 K in the case of YVO3. For both systems, anomalous phonon shifts which are related to spin-phonon coupling are observed below the V(3+) magnetic ordering temperature (T N1  ≈  110 K) while additional phonon anomalies are exclusively observed in HoVO3 around T (*)  ≈  15 K. On the other hand, infrared (IR) transmittance measurements as a function of temperature reveal Ho(3+5)I8  →  (5)I7 excitations and additional excitations assigned as vibronics. These latter combined with drastic changes in Ho(3+5)I8  →  (5)I7 excitations at T N2, are indicative of a strong coupling between the Ho(3+) ions and the ligand field. This could explain the large magnetocaloric capacity shown by HoVO3.",nonCancer
668,Multiplex reverse transcription-PCR screening for EML4-ALK fusion transcripts.,"EML4-ALK is a fusion-type protein tyrosine kinase that is generated by inv(2)(p21p23) in the genome of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). To allow sensitive detection of EML4-ALK fusion transcripts, we have now developed a multiplex reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) system that captures all in-frame fusions between the two genes. Primers were designed to detect all possible in-frame fusions of EML4 to exon 20 of ALK, and a single-tube multiplex RT-PCR assay was done with total RNA from 656 solid tumors of the lung (n = 364) and 10 other organs. From consecutive lung adenocarcinoma cases (n = 253), we identified 11 specimens (4.35%) positive for fusion transcripts, 9 of which were positive for the previously identified variants 1, 2, and 3. The remaining two specimens harbored novel transcript isoforms in which exon 14 (variant 4) or exon 2 (variant 5) of EML4 was connected to exon 20 of ALK. No fusion transcripts were detected for other types of lung cancer (n = 111) or for tumors from 10 other organs (n = 292). Genomic rearrangements responsible for the fusion events in NSCLC cells were confirmed by genomic PCR analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The novel isoforms of EML4-ALK manifested marked oncogenic activity, and they yielded a pattern of cytoplasmic staining with fine granular foci in immunohistochemical analysis of NSCLC specimens. These data reinforce the importance of accurate diagnosis of EML4-ALK-positive tumors for the optimization of treatment strategies.",cancer
2460,lncRNA uc009yby.1 promotes renal cell proliferation and is associated with poor survival in patients with clear cell renal cell carcinomas.,"The expression and function of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains unclear. The present study measured the expression profiles of three lncRNAs (uc009yby.1, ENST00000514034, and ENST00000450687) using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and assessed their signatures in distinguishing ccRCC from matched normal tissues via analysis of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The expression of uc009yby.1 was inhibited by transfection of renal cells with small interfering RNA, and then the cell proliferation was evaluated by using a Cell Counting Kit-8. The results showed that the expressions of uc009yby.1 and ENST00000514034 were markedly increased in ccRCC compared with the matched normal tissues (P<0.0001 and P=0.0008, respectively), whereas the ENST00000450687 expression was not significantly altered. ROC curves yielded an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.7000 for uc009yby.1, with sensitivity of 54.29% and specificity of 82.86%; and an AUC value of 0.6627 for ENST00000514034, with sensitivity of 60.00% and specificity of 67.14%. Furthermore, knockdown of uc009yby.1 suppressed renal cell proliferation (Day 0, P=0.7844; Day 1, P=0.0018; Day 2, P=0.0001; Day 3, P<0.000; Day 4, P<0.0001). Taken together, these findings suggest that the expression profiles of uc009yby.1 and ENST00000514034 may serve as novel biomarkers for ccRCC detection, and that uc009yby.1 is strongly associated with renal cell proliferation.",nonCancer
1184,"Detection of BCR-ABL mutations in patients with CML treated with imatinib is virtually always accompanied by clinical resistance, and mutations in the ATP phosphate-binding loop (P-loop) are associated with a poor prognosis.","Imatinib-treated chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients with acquired resistance commonly have detectable BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations. It is unclear whether patients who remain sensitive to imatinib also have a significant incidence of mutations. We evaluated 144 patients treated with imatinib for BCR-ABL kinase domain mutations by direct sequencing of 40 accelerated phase (AP), 64 late chronic phase (> or = 12 months from diagnosis, late-CP), and 40 early-CP patients. Mutations were detected in 27 patients at 17 different residues, 13 (33%) of 40 in AP, 14 (22%) of 64 in late-CP, and 0 of 40 in early-CP. Acquired resistance was evident in 24 (89%) of 27 patients with mutations. Twelve (92%) of 13 patients with mutations in the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding loop (P-loop) died (median survival of 4.5 months after the mutation was detected). In contrast, only 3 (21%) of 14 patients with mutations outside the P-loop died (median follow-up of 11 months). As the detection of mutations was strongly associated with imatinib resistance, we analyzed features that predicted for their detection. Patients who commenced imatinib more than 4 years from diagnosis had a significantly higher incidence of mutations (18 [41%] of 44) compared with those treated within 4 years (9 [9%] of 100), P <.0001. Lack of a major cytogenetic response (MCR) was also associated with a higher likelihood of detecting a mutation; 19 (38%) of 50 patients without a MCR had mutations compared with 8 (8.5%) of 94 with an MCR, P <.0001. In conclusion, the detection of kinase domain mutations using a direct sequencing technique was almost always associated with imatinib resistance, and patients with mutations in the P-loop had a particularly poor prognosis.",cancer
482,"A potent combination of the novel PI3K Inhibitor, GDC-0941, with imatinib in gastrointestinal stromal tumor xenografts: long-lasting responses after treatment withdrawal.","Oncogenic signaling in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) is sustained via PI3K/AKT pathway. We used a panel of six GIST xenograft models to assess efficacy of GDC-0941 as single agent or in combination with imatinib (IMA). Nude mice (n = 136) were grafted bilaterally with human GIST carrying diverse KIT mutations. Mice were orally dosed over four weeks, grouped as follows: (A) control; (B) GDC-0941; (C) imatinib, and (D) GDC+IMA treatments. Xenografts regrowth after treatment discontinuation was assessed in groups C and D for an additional four weeks. Tumor response was assessed by volume measurements, micro-PET imaging, histopathology, and immunoblotting. Moreover, genomic alterations in PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway were evaluated. In all models, GDC-0941 caused tumor growth stabilization, inhibiting tumor cell proliferation, but did not induce apoptosis. Under GDC+IMA, profound tumor regression, superior to either treatment alone, was observed. This effect was associated with the best histologic response, a nearly complete proliferation arrest and increased apoptosis. Tumor regrowth assays confirmed superior activity of GDC+IMA over imatinib; in three of six models, tumor volume remained reduced and stable even after treatment discontinuation. A positive correlation between response to GDC+IMA and PTEN loss, both on gene and protein levels, was found. GDC+IMA has significant antitumor efficacy in GIST xenografts, inducing more substantial tumor regression, apoptosis, and durable effects than imatinib. Notably, after treatment withdrawal, tumor regression was sustained in tumors exposed to GDC+IMA, which was not observed under imatinib.

2033,Ibrutinib modifies the function of monocyte/macrophage population in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"In lymphoid organs, nurse-like cells (NLCs) show properties of tumor-associated macrophages, playing a crucial role in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell survival. Ibrutinib, a potent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK), is able to counteract pro-survival signals in CLL cells. Since the effects on CLL cells have been studied in the last years, less is known about the influence of ibrutinib on NLCs properties. We sought to determine how ibrutinib modifies NLCs functions focusing on the balance between immunosuppressive and inflammatory features. Our data show that ibrutinib targets BTK expressed by NLCs modifying their phenotype and function. Treatment with ibrutinib reduces the phagocytic ability and increases the immunosuppressive profile of NLCs exacerbating the expression of M2 markers. Accordingly, ibrutinib hampers LPS-mediated signaling, decreasing STAT1 phosphorylation, while allows IL-4-mediated STAT6 phosphorylation. In addition, NLCs treated with ibrutinib are able to protect CLL cells from drug-induced apoptosis partially through the secretion of IL-10. Results from patient samples obtained prior and after 1 month of treatment with ibrutinib show an accentuation of CD206, CD11b and Tie2 in the monocytic population in the peripheral blood. Our study provides new insights into the immunomodulatory action of ibrutinib on monocyte/macrophage population in CLL.",nonCancer
1861,Tempest: Accelerated MS/MS Database Search Software for Heterogeneous Computing Platforms.,"MS/MS database search algorithms derive a set of candidate peptide sequences from in silico digest of a protein sequence database, and compute theoretical fragmentation patterns to match these candidates against observed MS/MS spectra. The original Tempest publication described these operations mapped to a CPU-GPU model, in which the CPU (central processing unit) generates peptide candidates that are asynchronously sent to a discrete GPU (graphics processing unit) to be scored against experimental spectra in parallel. The current version of Tempest expands this model, incorporating OpenCL to offer seamless parallelization across multicore CPUs, GPUs, integrated graphics chips, and general-purpose coprocessors. Three protocols describe how to configure and run a Tempest search, including discussion of how to leverage Tempest's unique feature set to produce optimal results. © 2016 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",nonCancer
2465,4-HPR impairs bladder cancer cell migration and invasion by interfering with the Wnt5a/JNK and Wnt5a/MMP-2 signaling pathways.,"In order to identify the anti-invasive and anti-metastatic effect of the synthetic retinoid N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (4-HPR) on the human bladder cancer EJ cell line, and to study its impact on the expression of wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site family, member 5a (Wnt5a), the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), the expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and the migration and invasion of EJ cells, migration and Matrigel invasion assays, as well as western blot analyses, were used in the present study. The results of the migration and Matrigel invasion assays indicated that the inhibitor of JNK SP600125 could inhibit the effect of 4-HPR on EJ cells. The expression of Wnt5a and MMP-2, and the phosphorylation of JNK, were analyzed by western blotting. The data revealed that 4-HPR inhibited the migration and invasion of bladder cancer cells through stimulating Wnt5a activation, causing the downregulation of MMP-2 expression and enhancing the phosphorylation of JNK in these cells. However, JNK signaling did not appear to have a direct effect on the expression of MMP-2. The present study demonstrated that 4-HPR may be a potent anti-invasive and anti-metastatic agent that functions via the Wnt5a/JNK and Wnt5a/MMP-2 signaling pathways.",nonCancer
485,"Association between expression of thymidylate synthase, dihydrofolate reductase, and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase and efficacy of pemetrexed in advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","Pemetrexed inhibits three key folate enzymes: thymidylate synthetase (TYMS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT). The relationship between the clinical efficacy of pemetrexed and the expression of folate enzymes in lung cancer cells is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether TYMS, DHFR, and GARFT expression affect the therapeutic efficacy of pemetrexed. Participants (n=50) were patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with pemetrexed. Samples were obtained by tumor biopsy before treatment. We isolated cancer cells from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using laser microdissection, and mRNA levels were analyzed using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Protein expression was evaluated using immunohistochemistry. We assessed the association between TYMS, DHFR, and GARFT expression and the therapeutic efficacy of pemetrexed. The median age was 66.8 years. Compared to healthy tissues, the relative TYMS mRNA expression ranged from 0.001 to 41.613 (mean 4.638 ± 1.357), and was significantly lower in responders compared to non-responders (1.671 ± 0.844 versus 5.978 ± 1.895, p=0.0142). Progression-free survival was prolonged in patients with lower TYMS mRNA expression compared to those with higher TYMS mRNA expression, but the difference was not statistically significant (18.0 versus 13.3 weeks, p=0.3001). DHFR and GARFT mRNA expression did not correlate with the efficacy of pemetrexed. We specifically analyzed TYMS, DHFR, and GARFT mRNA expression levels in lung cancer cells from biopsy specimens using laser microdissection. TYMS mRNA expression affected the therapeutic efficacy of pemetrexed and could therefore constitute a useful predictive biomarker for NSCLC patients receiving pemetrexed.",cancer
954,The genomic landscape of pediatric Ewing sarcoma.,"Pediatric Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the expression of chimeric fusions of EWS and ETS family transcription factors, representing a paradigm for studying cancers driven by transcription factor rearrangements. In this study, we describe the somatic landscape of pediatric Ewing sarcoma. These tumors are among the most genetically normal cancers characterized to date, with only EWS-ETS rearrangements identified in the majority of tumors. STAG2 loss, however, is present in more than 15% of Ewing sarcoma tumors; occurs by point mutation, rearrangement, and likely nongenetic mechanisms; and is associated with disease dissemination. Perhaps the most striking finding is the paucity of mutations in immediately targetable signal transduction pathways, highlighting the need for new therapeutic approaches to target EWS-ETS fusions in this disease. We performed next-generation sequencing of Ewing sarcoma, a pediatric cancer involving bone, characterized by expression of EWS-ETS fusions. We found remarkably few mutations. However, we discovered that loss of STAG2 expression occurs in 15% of tumors and is associated with metastatic disease, suggesting a potential genetic vulnerability in Ewing sarcoma.",cancer
2284,"Effects of origin, seasons and storage under different temperatures on germination of Senecio vulgaris (Asteraceae) seeds.","Invasive plants colonize new environments, become pests and cause biodiversity loss, economic loss and health damage. Senecio vulgaris L. (Common groundsel, Asteraceae), a widely distributing cosmopolitan weed in the temperate area, is reported with large populations in the north-eastern and south-western part, but not in southern, central, or north-western parts of China. We studied the germination behavior of S. vulgaris to explain the distribution and the biological invasion of this species in China. We used seeds originating from six native and six invasive populations to conduct germination experiments in a climate chamber and under outdoor condition. When incubated in a climate chamber (15 °C), seeds from the majority of the populations showed >90% germination percentage (GP) and the GP was equal for seeds with a native and invasive origin. The mean germination time (MGT) was significantly different among the populations. Under outdoor conditions, significant effects of origin, storage conditions (stored at 4 °C or ambient room temperature, ca. 27 °C) and seasons (in summer or autumn) were observed on the GP while the MGT was only affected by the season. In autumn, the GP (38.6%) was higher and the MGT was slightly longer than that in summer. In autumn, seeds stored at 4 °C showed higher GP than those stored at ambient room temperature (ca.27 °C), and seeds from invasive populations revealed higher GP than those from native populations. The results implied that the high temperature in summer has a negative impact on the germination and might cause viability loss or secondary dormancy to S. vulgaris seeds. Our study offers a clue to exploring what factor limits the distribution of S. vulgaris in China by explaining why, in the cities in South-East China and central China such as Wuhan, S. vulgaris cannot establish natural and viable populations.",nonCancer
1758,Using Molecular Initiating Events to Generate 2D Structure Activity Relationships for Toxicity Screening.,"Molecular initiating events (MIEs) can be boiled down to chemical interactions. Chemicals that interact must have intrinsic properties that allow them to do this, be these stereochemical, electronic or otherwise. In an attempt to discover some of these chemical characteristics we have utilized chemical informatics approaches, searching the ChEMBL database for molecules that bind to a number of pharmacologically important human toxicology targets, including G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), enzymes, ion channels, nuclear receptors, and transporters. By screening these compounds to find common 2D fragments, and combining this approach with a good understanding of the literature, bespoke 2D structural alerts have been written. These structure activity relationships (SARs) form the beginning of a tool for screening novel chemicals to establish the kind of interactions they may be able to make in humans. These SARs have been run through an internal validation to test their quality and the results of this are also discussed. MIEs have proven to be difficult to find and characterize but we believe we have taken a key first step with this work.",nonCancer
2038,Expression of truncated bile salt-dependent lipase variant in pancreatic pre-neoplastic lesions.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a dismal disease. The lack of specific symptoms still leads to a delay in diagnosis followed by death within months for most patients. Exon 11 of the bile salt-dependent lipase (BSDL) gene encoding variable number of tandem repeated (VNTR) sequences has been involved in pancreatic pathologies. We hypothesized that BSDL VNTR sequences may be mutated in PDAC. The amplification of BSDL VNTR from RNA extracted from pancreatic SOJ-6 cells allowed us to identify a BSDL amplicon in which a cytosine residue is inserted in a VNTR sequence. This insertion gives rise to a premature stop codon, resulting in a truncated protein and to a modification of the C-terminal amino-acid sequence; that is PRAAHG instead of PAVIRF. We produced antibodies directed against these sequences and examined pancreatic tissues from patients with PDAC and PanIN. Albeit all tissues were positive to anti-PAVIRF antibodies, 72.2% of patient tissues gave positive reaction with anti-PRAAHG antibodies, particularly in dysplastic areas of the tumor. Neoplastic cells with ductal differentiation were not reactive to anti-PRAAHG antibodies. Some 70% of PanIN tissues were also reactive to anti-PRAAHG antibodies, suggesting that the C insertion occurs early during pancreatic carcinogenesis. Data suggest that anti-PRAAHG antibodies were uniquely reactive with a short isoform of BSDL specifically expressed in pre-neoplastic lesions of the pancreas. The detection of truncated BSDL reactive to antibodies against the PRAAHG C-terminal sequence in pancreatic juice or in pancreatic biopsies may be a new tool in the early diagnosis of PDAC.",nonCancer

SCLC is often diagnosed with widespread metastases at the time of the initial diagnosis. A small proportion of late-stage SCLC patients are in a poor physical condition and exhibit disqualifying chemoradiotherapy indications. The present study reports the case of a patient who presented with lumbago and backache. Following physical examination, computed tomography, bronchoscopy and biopsy, the patient was diagnosed with SCLC with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of <2. One cycle of chemotherapy was administered whilst ventilator support was provided, and the patient's condition eventually improved.

307,Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) copy number is an independent prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) is an oncogene that can potentially be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and prognostic significance of alterations in FGFR1 copy number in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). FGFR1 status was evaluated by chromogenic silver in situ hybridisation (ISH) in tissue microarray sections from a retrospective cohort of 304 surgically resected NSCLCs and results were correlated with the clinicopathological features and overall survival. High FGFR1 gene copy number (amplification or high-level polysomy) was significantly more frequent in squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) (24.8%) and large cell carcinomas (LCC) (25%) compared to adenocarcinomas (11.3%) (p = 0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively). Among NSCLC there was no significant correlation between FGFR1-positive status and other clinicopathological features including age, gender, smoking history, tumour size, lymph node status, stage, grade, vascular, lymphatic or perineural invasion. FGFR1-positive patients showed a tendency to longer overall survival in univariate analysis (p = 0.14). Multivariate survival analysis using Cox regression model confirmed FGFR1-positive patients had a significant reduction in the risk of death compared to FGFR1-negative patients (HR 0.6; p = 0.02). High FGFR1 gene copy number is a common finding in SCC and LCC and is an independent favourable prognostic factor.",cancer
1413,Is Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Effective for Traumatic Brain Injury? A Rapid Evidence Assessment of the Literature and Recommendations for the Field.,"This systematic review examines the efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) for traumatic brain injury (TBI) to make evidence-based recommendations for its application and future research.|A comprehensive search was conducted to identify studies through 2014. Methodological quality was assessed and synthesis and interpretation of relevant data was performed.|Twelve randomized trials were included. All mild TBI studies demonstrated minimal bias and no statistically significant differences between HBO2 and sham arms. Statistically significant improvement occurred over time within both groups. Moderate-to-severe TBI studies were of mixed quality, with majority of results favoring HBO2 compared with ""standard care."" The placebo analysis conducted was limited by lack of details.|For mild TBI, results indicate HBO2 is no better than sham treatment. Improvements within both HBO2 and sham groups cannot be ignored. For acute treatment of moderate-to-severe TBI, although methodology appears flawed across some studies, because of the complexity of brain injury, HBO2 may be beneficial as a relatively safe adjunctive therapy if feasible. Further research should be considered to resolve the controversy surrounding this field, but only if methodological flaws are avoided and bias minimized.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Beginning in mid-1914, we observed an unprecedented and significant rise in the hospitalization rate for congenital malformations of the nervous system, Guillain-Barré syndrome, encephalitis, myelitis, and encephalomyelitis. These conditions are compatible with viral infection and inflammation-associated manifestations and may have been due to the entrance of Zika virus into Brazil. These findings show the necessity of adequately diagnosing and treating suspected cases of Zika virus infection and also that health surveillance systems can be improved by using routine data.",nonCancer

The areas under ROC (AUC) were compared to those of validated indexes (SDAI, CDAI, DAS28). ROC analysis was also applied to establish minimal and relevant clinical improvement for HUPI.|The best cut-off points for HUPI are 2, 5 and 9, classifying RA activity as remission if ≤2, low disease activity if >2 and ≤5), moderate if >5 and <9 and high if ≥9. HUPI's AUC to discriminate between low-moderate activity was 0.909 and between moderate-high activity 0.887. DAS28's AUCs were 0.887 and 0.846, respectively; both indices had higher accuracy than SDAI (AUCs: 0.832 and 0.756) and CDAI (AUCs: 0.789 and 0.728). HUPI discriminates remission better than DAS28-ESR in early arthritis, but similarly to SDAI. The HUPI cut-off for minimal clinical improvement was established at 2 and for relevant clinical improvement at 4. Response criteria were established based on these cut-off values.|The cut-offs proposed for HUPI perform adequately in patients with either early or long term arthritis.",nonCancer
2433,An observational study regarding the rate of growth in vertical and radial growth phase superficial spreading melanomas.,"The natural history of superficial spreading melanomas (SSMs) involves the progression from a radial growth phase (RGP) to a vertical growth phase (VGP). Currently, a patient's history represents the only method to estimate the rate of tumor growth. The present study aimed to verify whether the estimated rate of growth (ROG) of SSMs with a RGP or VGP exhibited any differences, and to evaluate the possible implications for the most important prognostic determinants. ROG was quantified as the ratio between Breslow's thickness in millimeters (mm) and the time of tumor growth in months, defined as the time between the date that the patient had first noticed the lesion in which melanoma subsequently developed and the date on which the patient first felt this lesion changed. A total of 105 patients (58 male and 47 female) were studied. Of these, 66 had VGP-SSMs, whilst 39 had RGP-only SSMs (RGP-SSMs). No significant differences in age and gender were observed between these groups. The mean Breslow's thickness in patients with VGP-SSMs was significantly greater than in patients with RGP-SSMs (0.78±0.68 vs. 0.48±0.22 mm, P=0.0096). Similarly, the ROG was observed to be higher in VGP-SSM vs. RGP-SSM patients (0.13±0.16 vs. 0.065±0.09 mm/month, P=0.0244). In patients with VGP-SSMs, Breslow's thickness and ROG were significantly higher for tumors with a mitotic rate of ≥1 mitosis/mm(2) compared with those with <1 mitosis/mm(2) (1.15±0.96 vs. 0.56±0.30 mm, P=0.0005; and 0.188±0.20 vs. 0.09±0.12 mm/month, P=0.0228, respectively). According to these results, two subsets of SSMs exist: The first is characterized by the presence of mitosis and a higher ROG, while the second exhibits a more indolent behavior and is characterized by an RGP only. Given the differences in the Breslow's thickness and ROG, clinicians must be aware of the possible diagnostic delay in these subsets of melanoma that, differently from true nodular melanomas, generally fulfill the classical ABCD clinical criteria.",nonCancer
145,Prognostic impact of IDH2 mutations in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia.,"Mutations in the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate(+)-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase gene 2 (IDH2) have recently been found in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as well as in patients with leukemic transformation of myeloproliferative neoplasms. We analyzed 272 adult patients with cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML) for the presence of IDH2 mutations in codons R140 and R172. IDH2 mutations of amino acid 140 or 172 could be identified in 12.1% of CN-AML patients, with the majority of mutations (90%) occurring at position R140. The incidence of IDH2 mutations in AML patients with aberrant karyotypes (n = 130) was significantly lower (3.8%, P = .006). IDH2 mutations were mutually exclusive with mutations in IDH1. IDH2 mutation status alone or in combination with IDH1 mutations had no impact on response to therapy, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in patients with CN-AML. In conclusion, IDH2 mutations are frequently found in CN-AML, but in our analysis these mutations did not influence treatment outcome.

424,Resensitization to Crizotinib by the Lorlatinib ALK Resistance Mutation L1198F.,"In a patient who had metastatic anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-rearranged lung cancer, resistance to crizotinib developed because of a mutation in the ALK kinase domain. This mutation is predicted to result in a substitution of cysteine by tyrosine at amino acid residue 1156 (C1156Y). Her tumor did not respond to a second-generation ALK inhibitor, but it did respond to lorlatinib (PF-06463922), a third-generation inhibitor. When her tumor relapsed, sequencing of the resistant tumor revealed an ALK L1198F mutation in addition to the C1156Y mutation. The L1198F substitution confers resistance to lorlatinib through steric interference with drug binding. However, L1198F paradoxically enhances binding to crizotinib, negating the effect of C1156Y and resensitizing resistant cancers to crizotinib. The patient received crizotinib again, and her cancer-related symptoms and liver failure resolved. (Funded by Pfizer and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01970865.).",cancer
626,Trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy in HER2-positive breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against HER2, has clinical activity in advanced breast cancer that overexpresses HER2. We investigated its efficacy and safety after excision of early-stage breast cancer and completion of chemotherapy. This international, multicenter, randomized trial compared one or two years of trastuzumab given every three weeks with observation in patients with HER2-positive and either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer who had completed locoregional therapy and at least four cycles of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Data were available for 1694 women randomly assigned to two years of treatment with trastuzumab, 1694 women assigned to one year of trastuzumab, and 1693 women assigned to observation. We report here the results only of treatment with trastuzumab for one year or observation. At the first planned interim analysis (median follow-up of one year), 347 events (recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, second nonbreast malignant disease, or death) were observed: 127 events in the trastuzumab group and 220 in the observation group. The unadjusted hazard ratio for an event in the trastuzumab group, as compared with the observation group, was 0.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 0.43 to 0.67; P<0.0001 by the log-rank test, crossing the interim analysis boundary), representing an absolute benefit in terms of disease-free survival at two years of 8.4 percentage points. Overall survival in the two groups was not significantly different (29 deaths with trastuzumab vs. 37 with observation). Severe cardiotoxicity developed in 0.5 percent of the women who were treated with trastuzumab. One year of treatment with trastuzumab after adjuvant chemotherapy significantly improves disease-free survival among women with HER2-positive breast cancer.

2442,Magnetic resonance imaging findings of extraventricular anaplastic ependymoma: A report of 11 cases.,"Anaplastic ependymomas are rare malignant tumors of the central nervous system. Few studies are available regarding their neuroradiological characteristics. The present study aimed to retrospectively review a series of patients with extraventricular anaplastic ependymoma and to analyze the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics to distinguish anaplastic ependymoma from other intracranial tumors. The clinical and pathological images of 11 patients who presented with histologically proven anaplastic ependymoma at Nanfang Hospital (Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China) between September 2004 and March 2015 were retrospectively reviewed. MRI scans were obtained in all 11 cases. Computed tomography scans were obtained in only 3 cases. In total, 8 tumors were located at the supratentorial parenchyma, and 3 tumors were derived from the cerebellar hemisphere. Images displayed quasi-circular (4/11), irregularly-lobulated (7/11) variable-intensity masses. The masses presented with cysts or necrosis (8/11), hemorrhage (7/11), marked (9/11) or mild (2/11) enhancement, and moderate (4/11), mild (3/11) or absent (4/11) peritumoral edema. The tumors were also frequently closely associated with the lateral ventricle (6/11). Tumors appeared isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted imaging (T1WI) and heterogeneously hyperintense or hypointense on T2WI, demonstrating wreath-like and ring-like characteristics, with intratumoral nodules (3/11) or marked flake-like inhomogeneous (6/11) enhancement on post-contrast MRI. Only 2 solid lesions showed mild enhancement (2/11). Although the MRI features of the extraventricular anaplastic ependymomas varied and were non-specific, these characteristic MRI findings, combined with the locations of the lesions, the age of onset and the short disease course, could be useful in differentiating anaplastic ependymomas from other intracranial neoplasms in the future.",nonCancer
192,EWS-FLI1 fusion transcript structure is an independent determinant of prognosis in Ewing's sarcoma.,"More than 90% of Ewing's sarcomas (ES) contain a fusion of the EWS and FLI1 genes, due to the t(11;22)(q24;q12) translocation. At the molecular level, the EWS-FLI1 rearrangements show great diversity. Specifically, many different combinations of exons from EWS and FLI1 encode in-frame fusion transcripts and result in differences in the length and composition of the chimeric protein, which functions as an oncogenic aberrant transcription factor. In the most common fusion type (type 1), EWS exon 7 is linked in frame with exon 6 of FLI1. As the fundamental pathogenetic lesion in ES, the molecular heterogeneity of these fusion transcripts may have functional and clinical significance. We performed a clinical and pathologic analysis of 112 patients with ES in which EWS-FLI1 fusion transcripts were identified by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Adequate treatment and follow-up data were available in 99 patients treated with curative intent. Median follow-up in these 99 patients was 26 months (range, 1 to 140 months). Univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed that included other prognostic factors, such as age, tumor location, size, and stage. Among the 99 patients suitable for survival analysis, the tumors in 64 patients contained the type 1 fusion and in 35 patients contained less common fusion types. Stage at presentation was localized in 74 patients and metastatic in 25. Metastases (relative risk [RR] = 2.6; P = .008), and type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion (RR = 0.37; P = .014) were, respectively, independent negative and positive prognostic factors for overall survival by multivariate analysis. Among 74 patients with localized tumors, the type 1 EWS-FLI1 fusion was also a significant positive predictor of overall survival (RR = 0.32; P = .034) by multivariate analysis. EWS-FLI1 fusion type appears to be prognostically relevant in ES, independent of tumor site, stage, and size. Further studies are needed to clarify the biologic basis of this phenomenon.",cancer

An older age at onset makes distinguishing tumefactive demyelinating lesion (TDL) from tumors even more challenging.|We report a case of brain TDL as the initial manifestation of late-onset MS associated with cervico-dorsal syringomyelia. A 66-year-old Caucasian woman with a 15-day history headache was referred to our hospital because of the acute onset of paraphasia.

Given the degree of overlap with other pathologic processes, CT and MRI findings failed to provide an unambiguous diagnosis; furthermore, because of the negative cerebrospinal fluid analysis for oligoclonal bands, the absence of other lesions, and the heightened suspicion of neoplasia, the clinicians opted to perform a stereotactic biopsy. Brain specimen analysis did not exclude the possibility of perilesional reactive gliosis and the patient, receiving anitiedemigen therapy, was monthly followed up. In the meanwhile, the second histological opinion of the brain specimen described the absence of pleomorphic glial cells indicating a tumor. These findings were interpreted as destructive inflammatory demyelinating disease and according to the evolution of MRI lesion burden, MS was diagnosed.|TDL still remains a problematic entity clinically, radiologically, and sometimes even pathologically.

We evaluated concentration changes in a suite of BFRs, including 13 polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy)ethane (BTBPE), in air at Toolik Lake, Arctic Alaska during the Northern Hemisphere summer of 2013. A high-volume active air sampler was used to collect 2 day integrated samples at the field station and three flow-through air samplers were used to collect 18 day integrated samples along a transect extending away from the field station. The BDE congeners associated with the penta-BDE commercial mixture (BDE-47, -99, and -100) were the most frequently detected BFRs and were found at concentrations consistent with those reported at other Arctic sites. Gas-particle distributions were influenced by temperature and correlations between gas-phase concentrations and temperature suggested that either volatilization from local sources or re-emission from secondary sources (that is, re-volatilization of BFRs that had migrated northwards from distant sources) was important for the lower-brominated BFRs during the warmer months. Source indicator analysis suggested no single dominant geographic source of BFRs while results from the flow-through samplers indicated that the field station itself was not a significant source of BFRs.",nonCancer

To examine a novel ligand model in a randomized clinical trial of panitumumab, irinotecan, and ciclosporin in colorectal cancer (PICCOLO) with with the a priori hypothesis that high tumor expression of either AREG or EREG would predict panitumumab therapy benefit in RAS-wt patients; and low expression, lack of efficacy. Prospectively planned retrospective biomarker study from the PICCOLO trial, which tested the addition of panitumumab to irinotecan therapy in patients with KRAS wt aCRC who experienced failure with prior fluoropyrimidine treatment. The analysis was conducted between 2012 and 2014. A predefined dichotomous model classified tumors as ""high expressor"" (either EREG or AREG in top tertile for messenger RNA level) or ""low expressor"" (neither EREG nor AREG in top tertile). Ligand expression was assessed as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Expression of AREG/EREG and RAS and BRAF mutations were assessed in archival tumor tissue. Primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points were response rate and overall survival (OS). Of the 696 PICCOLO trial patients in the irinotecan-vs-irinotecan with panitumumab randomization, 331 had sufficient tumor tissue available and measurement of ligand expression was successful in 323. High ligand expression was not prognostic for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79 [95% CI, 0.58-1.09]; P = .15) or PFS (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.68-1.27]; P = .64). The primary population had RAS wt aCRC (n = 220); for RAS wt patients with high ligand expression, median (interquartile range [IQR]) PFS was 8.3 [4.0-11.0] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.4 [2.8-6.7] months (irinotecan alone); HR, 0.38 [95% CI, 0.24-0.61]; P < .001). In RAS wt patients with low ligand expression, median (IQR) PFS was 3.2 [2.7-8.1] months (irinotecan with panitumumab) vs 4.0 [2.7-7.5] months (irinotecan); HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.64-1.37]; P = .73; interaction test results were significant [P = .01]). Less marked effects were seen for response rate (interaction P = .17) and OS (interaction P = .11). High ligand expression is a predictive marker for panitumumab therapy benefit on PFS in RAS wt patients; conversely, patients with low ligand expression gained no benefit. The current ""opt-in"" strategy for anti-EGFR therapy in all patients with RAS wt aCRC should be questioned. Expression of EREG/AREG is a useful biomarker for anti-EGFR therapy; optimization for clinical use is indicated. isrctn Identifier: ISRCTN93248876.",cancer
17,"The predictive value of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and PTEN for anti-EGFR treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","In metastatic colorectal cancer, mutation testing for KRAS exon 2 is widely implemented to select patients with wild-type tumors for treatment with the monocloncal anti-EGFR antibodies cetuximab and panitumumab. The added predictive value of additional biomarkers in the RAS-RAF-MAPK and PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathways in colorectal cancer is uncertain, which led us to systematically review the impact of alterations in KRAS (outside of exon 2), NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA and PTEN in relation to the clinical benefit from anti-EGFR treatment. In total, 22 studies that include 2395 patients formed the basis for a meta-analysis on alterations in KRAS exons 3 and 4, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA and PTEN and outcome of anti-EGFR treatment. Odds ratios for objective response rate (ORR) and hazard ratios (HR) for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated. Mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4, BRAF, PIK3CA and non-functional PTEN (mutations or loss of protein expression) significantly predicted poor ORR (OR = 0.26, OR = 0.29, OR = 0.39, and OR = 0.41, respectively). Significantly shorter PFS applied to mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4 (HR = 2.19), NRAS (HR = 2.30) and BRAF (HR = 2.95) and non-functional PTEN (HR = 1.88). Significantly shorter OS applied to mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4 (HR = 1.78), NRAS (HR = 1.85), BRAF (HR = 2.52), PIK3CA (HR = 1.43) and alterations in PTEN (HR = 2.09). Meta-analysis suggests that mutations in KRAS exons 3 and 4, NRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA and non-functional PTEN predict resistance to anti-EGFR therapies and demonstrates that biomarker analysis beyond KRAS exon 2 should be implemented for prediction of clinical benefit from anti-EGFR antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer.",cancer
1825,"Validation of A New Model for The Sizing of Denitrification Reactors, by Testing Full Scale Plants.","A new deterministic model for the calculation of the Specific Denitrification Rate (SDNR), to be used for the design of pre-denitrification reactors, was tested on eight full scale activated sludge plants of different capacity. The model represents the SDNR at 20°C (SDNR20°C) as a function of the sludge loading in the denitrification reactor (F:MDEN) and the residual dissolved oxygen in the denitrification reactor (DODEN). The results proved the ability of the new model in calculating the SDNR20°C. The model shows a little lower degree of adaptability for small-size plants. SDNR20°C proved a very strong sensitivity to DODEN, mainly in correspondence of low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (less than 2 mg L(-1)). The sensitivity decreases at greater DO values, but with a progressively less marked gradient, up to become weak only at DO concentrations greater than 0.4-0.5 mg L(-1), which are however rarely found in full-scale plants. DO concentrations measured in real-scale facilities are mostly in the range 0.2÷0.4 mg L(-1) and are mainly due to the mixed-liquor recycle. These concentrations cause severe adverse effects on the kinetics of nitrogen removal, and consequently on the denitrification performance. Thus, minimizing DO in the pre-denitrification reactor is relevant. The sensitivity of SDNR20°C to F:MDEN resulted much less important, as it is characterized by a growing linear behaviour with a very low slope.",nonCancer
289,A common polymorphism in the 5' UTR of ERCC5 creates an upstream ORF that confers resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy.,"We show that a common polymorphic variant in the ERCC5 5' untranslated region (UTR) generates an upstream ORF (uORF) that affects both the background expression of this protein and its ability to be synthesized following exposure to agents that cause bulky adduct DNA damage. Individuals that harbor uORF1 have a marked resistance to platinum-based agents, illustrated by the significantly reduced progression-free survival of pediatric ependymoma patients treated with such compounds. Importantly, inhibition of DNA-PKcs restores sensitivity to platinum-based compounds by preventing uORF1-dependent ERCC5 expression. Our data support a model in which a heritable 5' noncoding mRNA element influences individuals' responses to platinum-based chemotherapy.",cancer

Complicated grief involves the development of trauma symptoms, such as flashbacks, anxiety, and fear associated with daily activities after a death that disrupts the healthy grieving process. Daily activities such as eating, meal planning, grocery shopping, managing finances, and household maintenance can become painful and isolating for those experiencing complicated grief. Cognitive behavioral therapy is used to address irrational beliefs, feelings of depression or anger, and avoidance or numbing behaviors with a goal of leading the individual to adapting to a life, which no longer includes the lost loved one.|As part of the bereavement counseling program in a hospice, a need was identified in individuals who had lost loved ones and were having difficulty with adjusting to meal planning, grocery shopping, and cooking for one. To address this need for grief counseling centered on meal planning, grocery shopping, meal preparations, and eating meals alone, ""Culinary Grief Therapy: Cooking for One Series"" was developed with a local Culinary Arts Program.|Partnering with a local community college culinary arts program, the Cooking for One Series provides an interactive venue for cognitive behavioral therapy centered on meal planning and meal times.

2450,Peritoneal bladder fistula following radiotherapy for cervical cancer: A case report.,"The occurrence of a peritoneal bladder fistula as a result of radiation cystitis following radiotherapy for cervical cancer is extremely rare and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported previously. The present study reports the case of a 50-year-old woman who was diagnosed with cervical cancer 20 years previously and was treated with radiotherapy. The patient was diagnosed with radiation cystitis 10 years ago, which was treated with Chinese medicine, and began experiencing sudden abdominal pain and bowel difficulties following urination 3 years ago. B-ultrasound examination at The People's Hospital of Tongchuan (Tongchuan, China) detected the presence of abdominal pelvic fluid. Following antibiotic (levofloxacin for 5 days) and ascites extraction treatment, symptoms were relieved without recurrence. However, 5 days prior to admission to the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiatong University (Xi'an, China) on June 25, 2014, the patient experienced difficulty when urinating, abdominal pain and bloating, but did not experience frequent urination, hematuria or fever. Cystoscopic examination revealed a visible fistula on the bladder wall measuring 1×1 cm in diameter. Cytoscopic examination 1 month after catheterization and ascites extraction revealed no evidence of the fistula. The patient was followed up every 3 months for a year and a half, and is currently alive and well. In conclusion, the occurrence of peritoneal bladder fistula following radiation therapy is rare and cystoscopy is the preferred method of examination and diagnosis. Early detection and treatment may significantly improve the prognosis of patients.",nonCancer
1785,Persistent maternal depressive symptoms trajectories influence children's IQ: The EDEN mother-child cohort.,"This study assessed the association between timing and course of maternal depression from pregnancy onwards and children's cognitive development at ages 5 to 6. Potential interaction effects with child sex and family socioeconomic status were explored.|One thousand thirty-nine mother-child pairs from the French EDEN mother-child birth cohort were followed from 24 to 28 weeks of pregnancy onwards. Based on Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression (CES-D) and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores assessed at six timepoints, longitudinal maternal depressive symptom trajectories were calculated with a group-based semiparametric method. Children's cognitive function was assessed at ages 5 to 6 by trained interviewers with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence Third Edition (WPPSI-III), resulting in three composite scores: Verbal IQ (VIQ), Performance IQ (PIQ), and Full-Scale IQ (FSIQ).|Five trajectories of maternal symptoms of depression could be distinguished: no symptoms, persistent intermediate-level depressive symptoms, persistent high depressive symptoms, high symptoms in pregnancy only, and high symptoms in the child's preschool period only. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that, compared to children of mothers who were never depressed, children of mothers with persistent high levels of depressive symptoms had reduced VIQ, PIQ, and FSIQ scores. This association was moderated by the child's sex, boys appearing especially vulnerable in case of persistent maternal depression.|Chronicity of maternal depression predicts children's cognitive development at school entry age, particularly in boys. As maternal mental health is an early modifiable influence on child development, addressing the treatment needs of depressed mothers may help reduce the associated burden on the next generation.",nonCancer
2287,"The adder (Vipera berus) in Southern Altay Mountains: population characteristics, distribution, morphology and phylogenetic position.","As the most widely distributed snake in Eurasia, the adder (Vipera berus) has been extensively investigated in Europe but poorly understood in Asia. The Southern Altay Mountains represent the adder's southern distribution limit in Central Asia, whereas its population status has never been assessed. We conducted, for the first time, field surveys for the adder at two areas of Southern Altay Mountains using a combination of line transects and random searches. We also described the morphological characteristics of the collected specimens and conducted analyses of external morphology and molecular phylogeny. The results showed that the adder distributed in both survey sites and we recorded a total of 34 sightings. In Kanas river valley, the estimated encounter rate over a total of 137 km transects was 0.15 ± 0.05 sightings/km. The occurrence of melanism was only 17%. The small size was typical for the adders in Southern Altay Mountains in contrast to other geographic populations of the nominate subspecies. A phylogenetic tree obtained by Bayesian Inference based on DNA sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b (1,023 bp) grouped them within the Northern clade of the species but failed to separate them from the subspecies V. b. sachalinensis. Our discovery extends the distribution range of V. berus and provides a basis for further researches. We discuss the hypothesis that the adder expands its distribution border to the southwest along the mountains' elevation gradient, but the population abundance declines gradually due to a drying climate.",nonCancer
2266,Immunohistological Evaluation of Revascularized Immature Permanent Necrotic Teeth Treated by Platelet-Rich Plasma: An Animal Investigation.,"Pulp regeneration within the root canal of necrotic teeth is considered an ideal treatment to allow for continued root development and recover teeth vitality. This study aims to evaluate the inductive effect of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) on expression of angiogenesis factors and pulpal revascularization of immature necrotic teeth.|In this experimental animal study, we randomly divided 28 immature premolars from two mixed breed dogs into four groups, two experimental, negative and a positive control. Premolars in negative control group were left intact to develop normally. In the positive control and experimental groups, we removed the pulps and induced pulp necrosis, after which the chambers were sealed. Then, we applied the revascularization protocol in the experimental teeth located in the right quadrant. Two months later, the same protocol was applied to the left quadrant. The root canals were disinfected by irrigation with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) solution and application a triple antibiotic past. Following the induction of a blood clot (BC) inside the canal space, the coronal portion of the canals was assigned to either of two experimental groups: group 1 [BC+PRP+ mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)], group 2 (BC+MTA). Access cavities were sealed with a Glass Ionomer. The jaws that held the teeth were processed for histologic analysis of newly formed tissue and immunohistochemical evaluation according to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and factor VIII expressions in the canals.|Histological analysis demonstrated no significant difference in the formation of new vital tissue inside the root canals between groups1 (42.8%) and 2 (43.5%, P>0.05). Based on immunohistochemical evaluation, micro-vessel density (MVD) of the granulation tissues in both groups were similar and were higher compared with the normal pulp. We observed strongly positive expressions of VEGF and factor VIII in the stromal and endothelial cells, with severe intensity after one month. Both factors showed downregulation at three months postoperative.|PRP could not increase the formation of new vital tissue. The immunohistochemical results showed that VEGF and factor VIII played a pivotal role in the formation of new vessels inside the root canals of immature, non-vital teeth.",nonCancer
944,Sequence variant classification and reporting: recommendations for improving the interpretation of cancer susceptibility genetic test results.,"Genetic testing of cancer susceptibility genes is now widely applied in clinical practice to predict risk of developing cancer. In general, sequence-based testing of germline DNA is used to determine whether an individual carries a change that is clearly likely to disrupt normal gene function. Genetic testing may detect changes that are clearly pathogenic, clearly neutral, or variants of unclear clinical significance. Such variants present a considerable challenge to the diagnostic laboratory and the receiving clinician in terms of interpretation and clear presentation of the implications of the result to the patient. There does not appear to be a consistent approach to interpreting and reporting the clinical significance of variants either among genes or among laboratories. The potential for confusion among clinicians and patients is considerable and misinterpretation may lead to inappropriate clinical consequences. In this article we review the current state of sequence-based genetic testing, describe other standardized reporting systems used in oncology, and propose a standardized classification system for application to sequence-based results for cancer predisposition genes. We suggest a system of five classes of variants based on the degree of likelihood of pathogenicity. Each class is associated with specific recommendations for clinical management of at-risk relatives that will depend on the syndrome. We propose that panels of experts on each cancer predisposition syndrome facilitate the classification scheme and designate appropriate surveillance and cancer management guidelines. The international adoption of a standardized reporting system should improve the clinical utility of sequence-based genetic tests to predict cancer risk.",cancer
510,Functional genomics identifies ABCC3 as a mediator of taxane resistance in HER2-amplified breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with distinct molecular subtypes characterized by differential response to targeted and chemotherapeutic agents. Enhanced understanding of the genetic alterations characteristic of different subtypes is needed to pave the way for more personalized administration of therapeutic agents. We have taken a functional genomics approach using a well-characterized panel of breast cancer cell lines to identify putative biomarkers of resistance to antimitotic agents such as paclitaxel and monomethyl-auristatin-E (MMAE). In vitro studies revealed a striking difference in sensitivity to these agents between cell lines from different subtypes, with basal-like cell lines being significantly more sensitive to both agents than luminal or HER2-amplified cell lines. Genome-wide association studies using copy number data from Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism arrays identified amplification of the chromosome 17q21 region as being highly associated with resistance to both paclitaxel and MMAE. An unbiased approach consisting of RNA interference and high content analysis was used to show that amplification and concomitant overexpression of the gene encoding the ABCC3 drug transporter is responsible for conferring in vitro resistance to paclitaxel and MMAE. We also show that amplification of ABCC3 is present in primary breast tumors and that it occurs predominantly in HER2-amplified and luminal tumors, and we report on development of a specific fluorescence in situ hybridization assay that may have utility as a predictive biomarker of taxane resistance in breast cancer.",cancer

We investigated the cause of GISTs without KIT mutations. Because GISTs apparently expressed platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) alpha, we examined whether GISTs without KIT mutations had a mutation of PDGFR alpha. Whole coding region of PDGFR alpha complementary DNA (cDNA) was sequenced in GISTs with or without KIT mutations. Mutant PDGFR alpha cDNA was transfected into 293T human embryonic kidney cells, and autophosphorylation of PDGFR alpha was examined. Proliferation of Ba/F3 murine lymphoid cells stably transfected with mutant PDGFR alpha cDNA was estimated by tritium thymidine incorporation. Wild-type KIT cDNA was cotransfected with mutant PDGFR alpha cDNA, and immunoprecipitation by anti-KIT antibody was performed. Inhibitory effect of Imatinib mesylate on activated PDGFR alpha was examined. We found 2 types of constitutively activated mutations of PDGFR alpha, Val-561 to Asp or Asp-842 to Val, in 5 of 8 GISTs without KIT mutations but not in 10 GISTs with KIT mutations. Stable transfection of each mutation induced autonomous proliferation of Ba/F3 cells. Constitutively activated mutant PDGFR alpha bound and activated the cotransfected wild-type KIT. The constitutive activation of PDGFR alpha with Val-561 to Asp was inhibited effectively by Imatinib mesylate but that of PDGFR alpha with Asp-842 to Val was inhibited only weakly, even at the concentration of 10 micromol/L. The gain-of-function mutations of PDGFR alpha appear to play an important role in development of GISTs without KIT mutations.",cancer
1221,Combining nanoliposomal ceramide with sorafenib synergistically inhibits melanoma and breast cancer cell survival to decrease tumor development.,"Deregulation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways occurs in melanoma and breast cancer, deregulating normal cellular apoptosis and proliferation. Therapeutic cocktails simultaneously targeting these pathways could promote synergistically acting tumor inhibition. However, agents with manageable toxicity and mechanistic basis for synergy need identification. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the preclinical therapeutic efficacy and associated toxicity of combining sorafenib with nanoliposomal ceramide. Effects of sorafenib and nanoliposomal ceramide as single and combinatorial agents were examined on cultured cells using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium salt assays and CalcuSyn software used to assess synergistic or additive inhibition. Western blotting measured cooperative effects on signaling pathways. Rates of proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were measured in size- and time-matched tumors to identify mechanistic basis for inhibition. Toxicity was evaluated measuring animal weight, blood toxicity parameters, and changes in liver histology. Sorafenib and nanoliposomal ceramide synergistically inhibited cultured cells by cooperatively targeting mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signaling. A 1- to 2-fold increase in cellular apoptosis and 3- to 4-fold decrease in cellular proliferation were observed following combination treatment compared with single agents, which caused synergistically acting inhibition. In vivo, an approximately 30% increase in tumor inhibition compared with sorafenib treatment alone and an approximately 58% reduction in tumor size compared with nanoliposomal ceramide monotherapy occurred by doubling apoptosis rates with negligible systemic toxicity. This study shows that nanoliposomal ceramide enhances effectiveness of sorafenib causing synergistic inhibition. Thus, a foundation is established for clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of combining sorafenib with nanoliposomal ceramide for treatment of cancers.",cancer

75,TSC1 loss synergizes with KRAS activation in lung cancer development in the mouse and confers rapamycin sensitivity.,"Germline TSC1 or TSC2 mutations cause tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a hamartoma syndrome with lung involvement. To explore the potential interaction between TSC1 and KRAS activation in lung cancer, mice in which Tsc1 loss and Kras(G12D) expression occur in a small fraction of lung epithelial cells were generated. Mice with a combined Tsc1-Kras(G12D) mutation had dramatically reduced tumor latency (median survival: 11.6-15.6 weeks) in comparison with Kras(G12D) alone mutant mice (median survival: 27.5 weeks). Tsc1-Kras(G12D) tumors showed consistent activation of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin)C1 and responded to treatment with rapamycin, leading to significantly improved survival, whereas rapamycin had minor effects on cancers in Kras(G12D) alone mice. Loss of heterozygosity for TSC1 or TSC2 was found in 22% of 86 human lung cancer specimens. However, none of the 80 lung cancer lines studied showed evidence of the lack of expression of either TSC1 or TSC2 or a signaling pattern corresponding to complete loss. These data indicate that Tsc1 loss synergizes with the Kras mutation to enhance lung tumorigenesis in the mouse, but that this is a rare event in human lung cancer. Rapamycin may have unique benefit for patients with lung cancer, for whom the TSC1/TSC2 function is limited.",cancer

As a result of their old geological origin, geographical isolation, complex topography and local climate, these mountains provide an important refuge for endemic and relict species of plants and animals with strong Indo-Iranian affinities. Among vertebrates, the rock climbing nocturnal geckos of the genus Asaccus represent the genus with the highest number of endemic species in the Hajar Mountains. Recent taxonomic studies on the Zagros populations of Asaccus have shown that this genus is much richer than it was previously thought and preliminary morphological and molecular data suggest that its diversity in Arabia may also be underestimated.|A total of 83 specimens originally classified as Asaccus caudivolvulus (including specimens of the two new species described herein), six other Asaccus species from the Hajar and the Zagros Mountains and two representatives of the genus Haemodracon were sequenced for up to 2,311 base pairs including the mitochondrial 12S and cytb and the nuclear c-mos, MC1R and ACM4 genes. Phylogenetic relationships were inferred using both Bayesian and maximum-likelihood approaches and the former method was also used to calibrate the phylogenetic tree. Haplotype networks and phylogenetic trees were inferred from the phased nuclear genes only. Sixty-one alcohol-preserved adult specimens originally classified as Asaccus caudivolvulus from the northern Hajar Mountains were examined for 13 morphometric and the five meristic variables using multivariate methods and were also used to diagnose and describe the two new species.|The results of the molecular and morphological analyses indicate that the species originally classified as Asaccus caudivolvulus is, in fact, an assemblage of three different species that started diversifying during the Mid-Miocene. The molecular phylogenies consistently recovered the Hajar endemic A. montanus as sister taxon to all the other Asaccus species included in the analyses, rendering the Arabian species of Asaccus polyphyletic.|Using this integrative approach we have uncovered a very old diversification event that has resulted in a case of microendemicity, where three morphologically and ecologically similar medium-sized lizard species coexist in a very short and narrow mountain stretch. Asaccus caudivolvulus is restricted to a small coastal area of the UAE and at risk from heavy development, while the two new species described herein are widely distributed across the northern tip of the Hajar Mountains and seem to segregate in altitude when found in close proximity in the Musandam Peninsula (Oman). Similarly to other integrative analyses of Hajar reptiles, this study highlights the high level of diversity and endemicity of this arid mountain range, underscoring its status as one of the top hotspots of reptile diversity in Arabia.",nonCancer

524,AZD9291 in EGFR inhibitor-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer.,"The EGFR T790M mutation is the most common mechanism of drug resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients who have lung cancer with an EGFR mutation (EGFR-mutated lung cancer). In preclinical models, the EGFR inhibitor AZD9291 has been shown to be effective against both EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor-sensitizing and T790M resistance mutations. We administered AZD9291 at doses of 20 to 240 mg once daily in patients with advanced lung cancer who had radiologically documented disease progression after previous treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The study included dose-escalation cohorts and dose-expansion cohorts. In the expansion cohorts, prestudy tumor biopsies were required for central determination of EGFR T790M status. Patients were assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. A total of 253 patients were treated. Among 31 patients enrolled in the dose-escalation cohorts, no dose-limiting toxic effects occurred at the doses evaluated. An additional 222 patients were treated in five expansion cohorts. The most common all-cause adverse events were diarrhea, rash, nausea, and decreased appetite. The overall objective tumor response rate was 51% (95% confidence interval [CI], 45 to 58). Among 127 patients with centrally confirmed EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 61% (95% CI, 52 to 70). In contrast, among 61 patients without centrally detectable EGFR T790M who could be evaluated for response, the response rate was 21% (95% CI, 12 to 34). The median progression-free survival was 9.6 months (95% CI, 8.3 to not reached) in EGFR T790M-positive patients and 2.8 months (95% CI, 2.1 to 4.3) in EGFR T790M-negative patients. AZD9291 was highly active in patients with lung cancer with the EGFR T790M mutation who had had disease progression during prior therapy with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

866,"Phase I Study of Apitolisib (GDC-0980), Dual Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin Kinase Inhibitor, in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors.","This first-in-human phase I trial assessed the safety, tolerability, and preliminary antitumor activity of apitolisib (GDC-0980), a dual inhibitor of class I PI3K, and mTOR kinases. Once-daily oral apitolisib was administered to patients with solid tumors for days 1 to 21 or 1 to 28 of 28-day cycles. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed. Overall, 120 patients were treated at doses between 2 and 70 mg. The commonest ≥G3 toxicities related to apitolisib at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) at 40 mg once daily included hyperglycemia (18%), rash (14%), liver dysfunction (12%), diarrhea (10%), pneumonitis (8%), mucosal inflammation (6%), and fatigue (4%). Dose-limiting toxicities (1 patient each) were G4 fasting hyperglycemia at 40 mg (21/28 schedule) and G3 maculopapular rash and G3 fasting hyperglycemia at 70 mg (21/28 schedule). The pharmacokinetic profile was dose-proportional. Phosphorylated serine-473 AKT levels were suppressed by ≥90% in platelet-rich plasma within 4 hours at the MTD (50 mg). Pharmacodynamic decreases in fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography uptake of >25% occurred in 66% (21/32) of patients dosed at 40 mg once daily. Evidence of single-agent activity included 10 RECIST partial responses (PR; confirmed for peritoneal mesothelioma, PIK3CA mutant head-and-neck cancer, and three pleural mesotheliomas). Apitolisib exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics with target modulation at doses ≥16 mg. The RP2D was 40 mg once-daily 28/28 schedule; severe on-target toxicities were apparent at ≥40 mg, particularly pneumonitis. Apitolisib was reasonably tolerated at 30 mg, the selected dose for pleural mesothelioma patients given limited respiratory reserve. Modest but durable antitumor activity was demonstrated.

2302,Temporal dynamics of the developing lung transcriptome in three common inbred strains of laboratory mice reveals multiple stages of postnatal alveolar development.,"To characterize temporal patterns of transcriptional activity during normal lung development, we generated genome wide gene expression data for 26 pre- and post-natal time points in three common inbred strains of laboratory mice (C57BL/6J, A/J, and C3H/HeJ). Using Principal Component Analysis and least squares regression modeling, we identified both strain-independent and strain-dependent patterns of gene expression. The 4,683 genes contributing to the strain-independent expression patterns were used to define a murine Developing Lung Characteristic Subtranscriptome (mDLCS). Regression modeling of the Principal Components supported the four canonical stages of mammalian embryonic lung development (embryonic, pseudoglandular, canalicular, saccular) defined previously by morphology and histology. For postnatal alveolar development, the regression model was consistent with four stages of alveolarization characterized by episodic transcriptional activity of genes related to pulmonary vascularization. Genes expressed in a strain-dependent manner were enriched for annotations related to neurogenesis, extracellular matrix organization, and Wnt signaling. Finally, a comparison of mouse and human transcriptomics from pre-natal stages of lung development revealed conservation of pathways associated with cell cycle, axon guidance, immune function, and metabolism as well as organism-specific expression of genes associated with extracellular matrix organization and protein modification. The mouse lung development transcriptome data generated for this study serves as a unique reference set to identify genes and pathways essential for normal mammalian lung development and for investigations into the developmental origins of respiratory disease and cancer. The gene expression data are available from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) archive (GSE74243). Temporal expression patterns of mouse genes can be investigated using a study specific web resource (http://lungdevelopment.jax.org).",nonCancer
197,Mechanisms of acquired crizotinib resistance in ALK-rearranged lung Cancers.,"Most anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) are highly responsive to treatment with ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, patients with these cancers invariably relapse, typically within 1 year, because of the development of drug resistance. Herein, we report findings from a series of lung cancer patients (n = 18) with acquired resistance to the ALK TKI crizotinib. In about one-fourth of patients, we identified a diverse array of secondary mutations distributed throughout the ALK TK domain, including new resistance mutations located in the solvent-exposed region of the adenosine triphosphate-binding pocket, as well as amplification of the ALK fusion gene. Next-generation ALK inhibitors, developed to overcome crizotinib resistance, had differing potencies against specific resistance mutations. In addition to secondary ALK mutations and ALK gene amplification, we also identified aberrant activation of other kinases including marked amplification of KIT and increased autophosphorylation of epidermal growth factor receptor in drug-resistant tumors from patients. In a subset of patients, we found evidence of multiple resistance mechanisms developing simultaneously. These results highlight the unique features of TKI resistance in ALK-positive NSCLCs and provide the rationale for pursuing combinatorial therapeutics that are tailored to the precise resistance mechanisms identified in patients who relapse on crizotinib treatment.",cancer
2477,Low expression of PKCα and high expression of KRAS predict poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer.,"The current study aimed to determine the association between protein kinase Cα (PKCα) and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) expression and the response to folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX regimen) in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). The protein levels of PKCα and KRAS were analyzed by immunohistochemistry in tissue samples from patients with CRC and in non-cancerous tissues, including 152 cases of colorectal adenocarcinoma, 30 cases of colorectal adenoma and 20 normal colonic mucosa samples. The association between PKCα and KRAS expression and clinicopathological features was analyzed. The rates of positive PKCα protein expression in patients with poorly, moderately and well-differentiated adenocarcinoma were 16.7% (6/36), 40.0% (24/60), and 57.1% (32/56), respectively (P<0.013). The rate of positive KRAS expression in CRC patients was significantly higher than in patients with colon adenoma and normal colon mucosa (P<0.001). Expression levels of KRAS were associated with the degree of differentiation of CRC (P<0.001). Expression of PKCα was negatively correlated with KRAS expression in CRC tissues. The mean progression-free survival (PFS) times in patients with high and low expression of PKCα were 43.9 and 38.8 months, respectively (P<0.001). The mean PFS times were 38.5 and 45.5 months in patients with high and low expression of KRAS, respectively (P=0.001). In conclusion, low PKCα and high KRAS expression predicted relatively poor prognosis in patients with CRC.",nonCancer
1064,Targeting Akt3 signaling in triple-negative breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is currently the only major breast tumor subtype without effective targeted therapy and, as a consequence, in general has a poor outcome. To identify new therapeutic targets in TNBC, we performed a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen for protein kinases commonly amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer. Using this approach, we identified AKT3 as a gene preferentially required for the growth of TNBCs. Downregulation of Akt3 significantly inhibits the growth of TNBC lines in three-dimensional (3D) spheroid cultures and in mouse xenograft models, whereas loss of Akt1 or Akt2 have more modest effects. Akt3 silencing markedly upregulates the p27 cell-cycle inhibitor and this is critical for the ability of Akt3 to inhibit spheroid growth. In contrast with Akt1, Akt3 silencing results in only a minor enhancement of migration and does not promote invasion. Depletion of Akt3 in TNBC sensitizes cells to the pan-Akt inhibitor GSK690693. These results imply that Akt3 has a specific function in TNBCs; thus, its therapeutic targeting may provide a new treatment option for this tumor subtype.",cancer
1818,Serpins in Arthropod Biology.,"Serpins are the largest known family of serine proteinase inhibitors and perform a variety of physiological functions in arthropods. Herein, we review the field of serpins in arthropod biology, providing an overview of current knowledge and topics of interest. Serpins regulate insect innate immunity via inhibition of serine proteinase cascades that initiate immune responses such as melanization and antimicrobial peptide production. In addition, several serpins with anti-pathogen activity are expressed as acute-phase serpins in insects upon infection. Parasitoid wasps can downregulate host serpin expression to modulate the host immune system. In addition, examples of serpin activity in development and reproduction in Drosophila have also been discovered. Serpins also function in host-pathogen interactions beyond immunity as constituents of venom in parasitoid wasps and saliva of blood-feeding ticks and mosquitoes. These serpins have distinct effects on immunosuppression and anticoagulation and are of interest for vaccine development. Lastly, the known structures of arthropod serpins are discussed, which represent the serpin inhibitory mechanism and provide a detailed overview of the process.",nonCancer
176,Clinical implications of U2AF1 mutation in patients with myelodysplastic syndrome and its stability during disease progression.,"We aimed to analyze clinical impacts of the U2AF1 mutation on patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and its stability during disease progression. We checked mutation status of the U2AF1 by direct sequencing in 478 de novo MDS patients and correlated with the clinical characteristics and outcomes. We also sequentially analyzed the U2AF1 mutation in 421 samples from 142 patients to determine its stability during the disease courses. Thirty-six patients (7.5%) were found to have U2AF1 mutations, which occurred more frequently in younger patients (P = 0.033). U2AF1 mutation was an independent poor-risk factor for overall survival (OS) in all patients (P = 0.030) and younger patients (P = 0.041). U2AF1 mutation could also predict shorter time-to-leukemia transformation (TTL) in younger patients (P = 0.020). In addition, U2AF1 mutation was associated with shorter TTL in lower-risk MDS patients. Sequential analyses showed all original U2AF1 mutations in U2AF1-mutated patients were retained during follow-ups unless complete remission was achieved, whereas none of the U2AF1-wild patients acquired a novel mutation during disease evolution. U2AF1 mutation is more prevalent in younger MDS patients and associated with inferior outcomes although it is stable during the clinical course. The mutation may be used as a biomarker for risk stratification.",cancer
200,A clinically relevant androgen receptor mutation confers resistance to second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509.,"Despite the impressive clinical activity of the second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509 in patients with prostate cancer, acquired resistance invariably emerges. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying acquired resistance, we developed and characterized cell lines resistant to ARN-509 and enzalutamide. In a subset of cell lines, ARN-509 and enzalutamide exhibit agonist activity due to a missense mutation (F876L) in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor (AR). AR F876L is sufficient to confer resistance to ARN-509 and enzalutamide in in vitro and in vivo models of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Importantly, the AR F876L mutant is detected in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated patients with progressive CRPC. Thus, selective outgrowth of AR F876L is a clinically relevant mechanism of second-generation antiandrogen resistance that can potentially be targeted with next-generation antiandrogens. A missense mutation in the ligand-binding domain of the androgen receptor F876L confers resistance to the second-generation antiandrogens enzalutamide and ARN-509 in preclinical models of AR function and prostate cancer and is detected in plasma DNA from ARN-509-treated patients with progressive disease. These results chart a new path for the discovery and development of next-generation antiandrogens that could be coupled with a blood-based companion diagnostic to guide treatment decisions.",cancer
1669,S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy versus cisplatin alone with concurrent radiotherapy in Chinese patients with nonsmall-cell lung cancer: A multicentre randomized controlled trial.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of S-1 plus cisplatin combined with concurrent radiotherapy (SCCCR) versus cisplatin alone combined with concurrent radiotherapy (CCCR) in Chinese patients with unresectable stage III nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).|Between January 2012 and December 2014, 72 eligible Chinese patients with NSCLC were included and randomly divided into 2 groups, each having 36 patients. Patients in the SCCCR group received S-1 plus cisplatin with concurrent, radiotherapy. The other 36 patients in the CCCR group were administered cisplatin with concurrent radiotherapy. The primary outcome was the overall response rate. The secondary outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and adverse events.|The 3-year overall response rates for the SCCCR and CCCR groups were 60.1% and 53.3%, respectively (P = 0.041). The median OS was 35.1 (range, 6.5-47.2) months and 24.6 (range, 2.8-24.3) months for the SCCCR and CCCR groups, respectively (P = 0.016). The median PFS for the SCCCR and CCCR groups was 31.4 (range, 5.6-39.3) months and 22.3 (range, 2.4-36.5) months, respectively (P = 0.023). The toxicity profiles were similar for both groups.|The efficacy and safety of SCCCR was more encouraging compared to those of CCCR in Chinese NSCLC patients. In addition, the toxicities in both groups were tolerable.",nonCancer
366,Discovery of a mutant-selective covalent inhibitor of EGFR that overcomes T790M-mediated resistance in NSCLC.,"Patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGF receptor (EGFR) mutations initially respond to first-generation reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. However, clinical efficacy is limited by acquired resistance, frequently driven by the EGFR(T790M) mutation. CO-1686 is a novel, irreversible, and orally delivered kinase inhibitor that specifically targets the mutant forms of EGFR, including T790M, while exhibiting minimal activity toward the wild-type (WT) receptor. Oral administration of CO-1686 as single agent induces tumor regression in EGFR-mutated NSCLC tumor xenograft and transgenic models. Minimal activity of CO-1686 against the WT EGFR receptor was observed. In NSCLC cells with acquired resistance to CO-1686 in vitro, there was no evidence of additional mutations or amplification of the EGFR gene, but resistant cells exhibited signs of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and demonstrated increased sensitivity to AKT inhibitors. These results suggest that CO-1686 may offer a novel therapeutic option for patients with mutant EGFR NSCLC. We report the preclinical development of a novel covalent inhibitor, CO-1686, that irreversibly and selectively inhibits mutant EGFR, in particular the T790M drug-resistance mutation, in NSCLC models. CO-1686 is the fi rst drug of its class in clinical development for the treatment of T790M-positive NSCLC, potentially offering potent inhibition of mutant EGFR while avoiding the on-target toxicity observed with inhibition of the WT EGFR.",cancer
790,"Dabrafenib in patients with melanoma, untreated brain metastases, and other solid tumours: a phase 1 dose-escalation trial.","Dabrafenib is an inhibitor of BRAF kinase that is selective for mutant BRAF. We aimed to assess its safety and tolerability and to establish a recommended phase 2 dose in patients with incurable solid tumours, especially those with melanoma and untreated, asymptomatic brain metastases. We undertook a phase 1 trial between May 27, 2009, and March 20, 2012, at eight study centres in Australia and the USA. Eligible patients had incurable solid tumours, were 18 years or older, and had adequate organ function. BRAF mutations were mandatory for inclusion later in the study because of an absence of activity in patients with wild-type BRAF. We used an accelerated dose titration method, with the first dose cohort receiving 12 mg dabrafenib daily in a 21-day cycle. Once doses had been established, we expanded the cohorts to include up to 20 patients. On the basis of initial data, we chose a recommended phase 2 dose. Efficacy at the recommended phase 2 dose was studied in patients with BRAF-mutant tumours, including those with non-Val600Glu mutations, in three cohorts: metastatic melanoma, melanoma with untreated brain metastases, and non-melanoma solid tumours. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00880321. We enrolled 184 patients, of whom 156 had metastatic melanoma. The most common treatment-related adverse events of grade 2 or worse were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (20 patients, 11%), fatigue (14, 8%), and pyrexia (11, 6%). Dose reductions were necessary in 13 (7%) patients. No deaths or discontinuations resulted from adverse events, and 140 (76%) patients had no treatment-related adverse events worse than grade 2. Doses were increased to 300 mg twice daily, with no maximum tolerated dose recorded. On the basis of safety, pharmacokinetic, and response data, we selected a recommended phase 2 dose of 150 mg twice daily. At the recommended phase 2 dose in 36 patients with Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were reported in 25 (69%, 95% CI 51·9-83·7) and confirmed responses in 18 (50%, 32·9-67·1). 21 (78%, 57·7-91·4) of 27 patients with Val600Glu BRAF-mutant melanoma responded and 15 (56%, 35·3-74·5) had a confirmed response. In Val600 BRAF-mutant melanoma, responses were durable, with 17 patients (47%) on treatment for more than 6 months. Responses were recorded in patients with non-Val600Glu BRAF mutations. In patients with melanoma and untreated brain metastases, nine of ten patients had reductions in size of brain lesions. In 28 patients with BRAF-mutant non-melanoma solid tumours, apparent antitumour activity was noted in a gastrointestinal stromal tumour, papillary thyroid cancers, non-small-cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, and colorectal cancer. Dabrafenib is safe in patients with solid tumours, and an active inhibitor of Val600-mutant BRAF with responses noted in patients with melanoma, brain metastases, and other solid tumours.

1123,PTEN and PIK3CA expression is associated with prolonged survival after gefitinib treatment in EGFR-mutated lung cancer patients.,"We and other researchers have previously reported that pulmonary adenocarcinomas with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are usually sensitive to gefitinib, an EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, although this relationship is not complete. In this study, we searched for mutations or changes in the expression of genes downstream to EGFR and evaluated their relationship with the effectiveness of gefitinib. We studied 78 lung cancer patients who had recurrent disease after surgical resection and were treated with gefitinib. We searched for mutations occurring in the KRAS and PIK3CA gene. We also evaluated the expression level of EGFR, PIK3CA, and PTEN by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Gefitinib effectiveness was evaluated by imaging studies; a survival analysis was also done. We found seven (9%) somatic mutations in KRAS and two (2%) in PIK3CA. EGFR mutations were present in 44 (56%). KRAS mutations were found only in tumors without EGFR mutations, whereas PIK3CA mutation was found in tumors with EGFR mutation. Tumor response was assessable in 52 tumors. None of the six tumors with KRAS mutations responded to gefitinib treatment; however, two tumors with PIK3CA mutations showed partial response. Survival was significantly longer in patients with EGFR mutations or in those without KRAS mutations. In tumors with EGFR mutations, survival was longer in those with high PIK3CA or PTEN expression than in those with low expression of these molecules. An evaluation of the KRAS mutation, as well as PIK3CA and PTEN expression, might help identify lung cancer patients who are most suitable for gefitinib treatment.",cancer

Extent of bone metastasis was categorized according to a modified Soloway score: score 1, n = 319; score 2, n = 483; and score 3, n = 98 patients. The primary outcome measurements were mean differences in QoL and overall survival.|QoL rating scales showed a decrease with increasing extent of bone metastasis (p < 0.001). The mean global health status decreased from 64.4 to 50.5 for Soloway score 1 and 3, respectively. Following adjustment for performance status, analgesic consumption, grade of malignancy, alkaline phosphatase, prostate-specific antigen, haemoglobin and global health status, Soloway score 2 and 3 had a 47% [hazard ratio (HR) 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-1.80] and 78% (HR 1.78 95%, CI 1.32-2.42) increased mortality, respectively, compared to Soloway score 1.

1259,SMO Gene Amplification and Activation of the Hedgehog Pathway as Novel Mechanisms of Resistance to Anti-Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Drugs in Human Lung Cancer.,"Resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) of EGF receptor (EGFR) is often related to activation of other signaling pathways and evolution through a mesenchymal phenotype. Because the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has emerged as an important mediator of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), we studied the activation of Hh signaling in models of EGFR-TKIs intrinsic or acquired resistance from both EGFR-mutated and wild-type (WT) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. Activation of the Hh pathway was found in both models of EGFR-mutated and EGFR-WT NSCLC cell line resistant to EGFR-TKIs. In EGFR-mutated HCC827-GR cells, we found SMO (the Hh receptor) gene amplification, MET activation, and the functional interaction of these two signaling pathways. In HCC827-GR cells, inhibition of SMO or downregulation of GLI1 (the most important Hh-induced transcription factor) expression in combination with MET inhibition exerted significant antitumor activity.In EGFR-WT NSCLC cell lines resistant to EGFR inhibitors, the combined inhibition of SMO and EGFR exerted a strong antiproliferative activity with a complete inhibition of PI3K/Akt and MAPK phosphorylation. In addition, the inhibition of SMO by the use of LDE225 sensitizes EGFR-WT NSCLC cells to standard chemotherapy. This result supports the role of the Hh pathway in mediating resistance to anti-EGFR-TKIs through the induction of EMT and suggests new opportunities to design new treatment strategies in lung cancer.",cancer
457,"Major partial response to crizotinib, a dual MET/ALK inhibitor, in a squamous cell lung (SCC) carcinoma patient with de novo c-MET amplification in the absence of ALK rearrangement.","The initial radiotherapy of a 73 years old Caucasian male patient with advanced squamous cell lung carcinoma was terminated due to severe pericarditis. Subsequently, the tumor sample was analyzed for possible targets with comprehensive molecular diagnostics. EGFR, KRAS and PIK3CA genes were wild type, ALK and ROS1 were negative for rearrangement, but c-MET was amplified by fluorescent in situ hybridization. The kinase inhibitor crizotinib is already in clinical use for the treatment of ALK positive non-small cell lung cancers, but it is also known to be a potent c-MET inhibitor. The patient was treated with the standard dose of twice a day 250 mg crizotinib as a monotherapy. Major partial response to therapy was confirmed by chest CT and PET/CT after 8 weeks on therapy. C-MET expression is associated with poor prognosis and resistance to EGFR inhibitors. This case may indicate that c-MET tyrosine kinase inhibitors can be an effective targeted treatment option for squamous cell carcinoma patients, and future clinical trials should be expanded for this patient group as well.",cancer
1120,KRAS and BRAF oncogenic mutations in MSS colorectal carcinoma progression.,"In sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC), KRAS are alternative to BRAF mutations and occur, respectively, in 30 and 10% of cases. Few reports addressed the association between KRAS-BRAF mutations and tumour progression specifically in sporadic microsatellite-stable (MSS) CRC. We screened KRAS and BRAF in 250 MSS primary CRC and 45 lymph node (LN) metastases and analysed the pathological features of the cases to understand the involvement of KRAS-BRAF activation in progression and metastasis. Forty-five per cent of primary MSS CRCs carried mutations in at least one of these genes and mutations were associated with wall invasion (P=0.02), presence and number of LN metastases (P=0.02 and P=0.03, respectively), distant metastases (P=0.004) and advanced stage (P=0.01). We demonstrated that KRAS and BRAF are alternative events in Tis and T1 MSS CRC and, KRAS rather than BRAF mutations, contributed to the progression of MSS CRC. The frequency of KRAS and/or BRAF mutations was higher in LN metastases than in primary carcinomas (P=0.0002). Mutated LN metastases displayed KRAS associated or not with BRAF mutations. BRAF mutations were never present as a single event. Concomitant KRAS and BRAF mutations increased along progression of MSS CRCs, suggesting that activation of both genes is likely to harbour a synergistic effect.",cancer
2167,Quantification of nucleic acid quality in postmortem tissues from a cancer research autopsy program.,"The last decade has seen a marked rise in the use of cancer tissues obtained from research autopsies. Such resources have been invaluable for studying cancer evolution or the mechanisms of therapeutic resistance to targeted therapies. Degradation of biomolecules is a potential challenge to usage of cancer tissues obtained in the post-mortem setting and remains incompletely studied. We analysed the nucleic acid quality in 371 different frozen tissue samples collected from 80 patients who underwent a research autopsy, including eight normal tissue types, primary and metastatic tumors. Our results indicate that RNA integrity number (RIN) of normal tissues decline with the elongation of post-mortem interval (PMI) in a tissue-type specific manner. Unlike normal tissues, the RNA quality of cancer tissues is highly variable with respect to post-mortem interval. The kinetics of DNA damage also has tissue type-specific features. Moreover, while DNA degradation is an indicator of low RNA quality, the converse is not true. Finally, we show that despite RIN values as low as 5.0, robust data can be obtained by RNA sequencing that reliably discriminates expression signatures.",nonCancer

BIRC3 mutations (2.5%) were associated with unmutated IGHV genes (U-CLL), del(11q) and trisomy 12, whereas MYD88 mutations (2.2%) were exclusively found among M-CLL. NOTCH1, SF3B1 and TP53 exhibited variable frequencies and were mostly enriched within clinically aggressive cases. Interestingly, as the timespan between diagnosis and mutational screening increased, so too did the incidence of SF3B1 mutations; no such increase was observed for NOTCH1 mutations. Regarding the clinical impact, NOTCH1 mutations, SF3B1 mutations and TP53 aberrations (deletion/mutation, TP53ab) correlated with shorter time-to-first-treatment (P<0.0001) in 889 treatment-naive Binet stage A cases. In multivariate analysis (n=774), SF3B1 mutations and TP53ab along with del(11q) and U-CLL, but not NOTCH1 mutations, retained independent significance. Importantly, TP53ab and SF3B1 mutations had an adverse impact even in U-CLL. In conclusion, we support the clinical relevance of novel recurrent mutations in CLL, highlighting the adverse impact of SF3B1 and TP53 mutations, even independent of IGHV mutational status, thus underscoring the need for urgent standardization/harmonization of the detection methods.",cancer
2357,cDNA-AFLP analysis reveals differential gene expression in incompatible interaction between infected non-heading Chinese cabbage and Hyaloperonospora parasitica.,"Non-heading Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) is one of the main green leafy vegetables in the world, especially in China, with significant economic value. Hyaloperonospora parasitica is a fungal pathogen responsible for causing downy mildew disease in Chinese cabbage, which greatly affects its production. The objective of this study was to identify transcriptionally regulated genes during incompatible interactions between non-heading Chinese cabbage and H. parasitica using complementary DNA-amplified fragment length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP). We obtained 129 reliable differential transcript-derived fragments (TDFs) in a resistant line 'Suzhou Qing'. Among them, 121 upregulated TDFs displayed an expression peak at 24-48 h post inoculation (h.p.i.). Fifteen genes were further selected for validation of cDNA-AFLP expression patterns using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results confirmed the altered expression patterns of 13 genes (86.7%) revealed by the cDNA-AFLP. We identified four TDFs related to fungal resistance among the 15 TDFs. Furthermore, comparative analysis of four TDFs between resistant line 'Suzhou Qing' and susceptible line 'Aijiao Huang' showed that transcript levels of TDF14 (BcLIK1_A01) peaked at 48 h.p.i. and 25.1-fold increased in the resistant line compared with the susceptible line. Similarly, transcript levels of the other three genes, TDF42 (BcCAT3_A07), TDF75 (BcAAE3_A06) and TDF88 (BcAMT2_A05) peaked at 24, 48 and 24 h.p.i. with 25.1-, 100- and 15.8-fold increases, respectively. The results suggested that the resistance genes tended to transcribe at higher levels in the resistance line than in the susceptible line, which may provide resistance against pathogen infections. The present study might facilitate elucidating the molecular basis of the infection process and identifying candidate genes for resistance improvement of susceptible cultivars.",nonCancer
2178,Breaking up is hard to do: Women's experience of dissolving their same-sex relationship.,"While prior research has compared same-sex to heterosexual relationships, very little attention has been paid to the unique experiences of women dissolving same-sex relationships, especially in the context of shifting legal and social policies. The current study examined the experience of 20 women who dissolved their same-sex relationship between 2002 and 2014. Participants were drawn from a longitudinal sample of same-sex and heterosexual couples and were interviewed using a semi-structured protocol. Interviews focused on three primary research questions: reasons for dissolution, emotional reactions, and role of legal status. While reasons for dissolution largely mirrored literature on women in heterosexual relationships, emotional reactions and the role of legal status were both influenced by sexual minority-specific factors related to minority stress and the recent societal changes pertaining to legal relationship recognition. Results are interpreted in a framework of minority stress and the ongoing legacy of institutional discrimination experienced by women in same-sex relationships.",nonCancer
1424,Diastereoselective Pd(II)-Catalyzed sp3 C-H Arylation Followed by Ring Opening of Cyclopropanecarboxamides: Construction of anti beta-Acyloxy Carboxamide Derivatives.,"The diastereoselective Pd(OAc)2-catalyzed, bidentate ligand-directed sp3 C-H activation/arylation followed by ring opening of cyclopropanecarboxamides, which were assembled from cyclopropanecarbonyl chlorides and bidentate ligands (e.g., 8-aminoquinoline and 2-(methylthio)aniline, has been investigated. The treatment of various cyclopropanecarboxamides with excess amounts of aryl iodides in the presence of the Pd(OAc)2 catalyst, AgOAc and AcOH directly afforded the corresponding multiple beta-C-H arylated open-chain carboxamides (anti beta-acyloxy amides). This method has led to the construction of several anti beta-acyloxy amides that possess vicinal stereocenters with a high degree of stereocontrol with the formation of a new C-O bond and three new C-C bonds. A plausible mechanism for the formation of multiple beta-C-H arylated open-chain carboxamides from the Pd-catalyzed, bidentate ligand-directed beta-C-H arylation and the ring opening of cyclopropanecarboxamides is proposed based on several control experiments. The observed diastereoselectivity and anti stereochemistry of the beta-acyloxy amides were ascertained based on X-ray structural analysis of representative beta-acyloxy amides.",nonCancer
156,IDH1 mutations in low-grade astrocytomas predict survival but not response to temozolomide.,"Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) have been implicated in tumorigenesis of gliomas. Patients with high-grade astrocytomas with IDH1 or IDH2 mutations were reported to have a better survival, but it is unknown if this improved survival also holds for low-grade astrocytoma and whether these mutations predict outcome to specific treatment. We retrospectively investigated the correlation of IDH1 and IDH2 mutations with overall survival and response to temozolomide in a cohort of patients with dedifferentiated low-grade astrocytomas treated with temozolomide at the time of progression after radiotherapy. IDH1 mutations were present in 86% of the 49 progressive astrocytomas. No mutations in IDH2 were found. Presence of IDH1 mutations were early events and significantly improved overall survival (median survival 48 vs 98 months), but did not affect outcome of temozolomide treatment. These results indicate that IDH1 mutations identify a subgroup of gliomas with an improved survival, but are unrelated to the temozolomide response.",cancer
1202,Targeted therapy in GIST: in silico modeling for prediction of resistance.,"Elucidation of the genetic processes leading to neoplastic transformation has identified cancer-promoting molecular alterations that can be selectively targeted by rationally designed therapeutic agents. Protein kinases are druggable targets and have been studied intensively. New methodologies--including crystallography and three-dimensional modeling--have allowed the rational design of potent and selective kinase inhibitors that have already reached the clinical stage. However, despite the clinical success of kinase-targeted therapies, most patients that respond eventually relapse as a result of acquired resistance. Darwinian-type selection of secondary mutations seems to have a major role in this resistance. The emergence and/or expansion of tumor clones containing new mutations in the target kinase and that are drug-insensitive have been observed after chronic treatment. The resistance mechanisms to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, in particular secondary resistant mutations as a consequence of treatment, will be discussed in detail. In particular, this Review will focus on KIT and PDGFRA mutations, which are involved in the pathogenesis of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Harnessing the selection of mutated variants developed to overcome these resistance mechanisms is an ongoing goal of current research and new strategies to overcome drug resistance is being envisaged.",cancer
2177,Antigen-specific T cell Redirectors: a nanoparticle based approach for redirecting T cells.,"Redirection of T cells to target and destroy tumors has become an important clinical tool and major area of research in tumor immunology. Here we present a novel, nanoparticle-based approach to selectively bind antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells (CTL) and redirect them to kill tumors, termed ATR (Antigen-specific T cell Redirectors). ATR were generated by decorating nanoparticles with both an antigen-specific T cell binding moiety, either peptide loaded MHC-Ig dimer or clonotypic anti-TCR antibody, and a model tumor cell binding moiety, anti-CD19 antibody to engage CD19+ tumor cells. ATR stably bind tumor cells and CTL in a dose dependent fashion and stimulate antigen-specific conjugate formation between those cells. ATR induced redirected lysis of tumor cells in vitro, as demonstrated by 51Cr-release killing. In vivo ATR administration led to reduced tumor growth in a SCID/beige human lymphoma treatment model. In summary, ATR represent a novel, nanoparticle based approach for redirecting antigen-specific CTL to kill tumors.",nonCancer
2273,Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Human-Derived Amniotic Membrane Stem Cells Using PEGylated Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles.,"The label and detection of cells injected into target tissues is an area of focus for researchers. Iron oxide nanoparticles can be used to label cells as they have special characteristics. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of iron oxide nanoparticles on human-derived amniotic membrane stem cell (hAMCs) survival and to investigate the magnetic properties of these nanoparticles with increased contrast in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).|In this experimental study, we initially isolated mesenchymal stem cells from amniotic membranes and analyzed them by flow cytometry. In addition, we synthesized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) and characterized them by various methods. The SPIONs were incubated with hAMCs at concentrations of 25-800 μg/mL. The cytotoxicity of nanoparticles on hAMCs was measured by the MTT assay. Next, we evaluated the effectiveness of the magnetic nanoparticles as MRI contrast agents. Solutions of SPION were prepared in water at different iron concentrations for relaxivity measurements by a 1.5 Tesla clinical MRI instrument.|The isolated cells showed an adherent spindle shaped morphology. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated SPIONs exhibited a spherical morphology. The average particle size was 20 nm and magnetic saturation was 60 emu/g. Data analysis showed no significant reduction in the percentage of viable cells (97.86 ± 0.41%) after 72 hours at the 125 μg/ml concentration compared with the control. The relaxometry results of this SPION showed a transverse relaxivity of 6.966 (μg/ml.s)(-1).|SPIONs coated with PEG used in this study at suitable concentrations had excellent labeling efficiency and biocompatibility for hAMCs.",nonCancer
45,Massively parallel tumor multigene sequencing to evaluate response to panitumumab in a randomized phase III study of metastatic colorectal cancer.,"To investigate whether EGF receptor (EGFR) pathway mutations predicted response to monotherapy with panitumumab, an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody, in a randomized phase III study of metastatic colorectal cancer. Using massively parallel multigene sequencing, we analyzed 320 samples for 9 genes, with multigene sequence data from 288 (90%) samples. Mutation rates were: KRAS (45%), NRAS (5%), BRAF (7%), PIK3CA (9%), PTEN (6%), TP53 (60%), EGFR (1%), AKT1 (<1%), and CTNNB1 (2%). In the randomized study and open-label extension, 22 of 138 (16%) wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients versus 0 of 103 mutant KRAS (codons 12/13) patients had objective responses. Of 6 mutant KRAS (codon 61) patients, 1 with a Q61H mutation achieved partial response during the extension. Among wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients, 0 of 9 patients with NRAS mutations, 0 of 13 with BRAF mutations, 2 of 10 with PIK3CA mutations, 1 of 9 with PTEN mutations, and 1 of 2 with CTNNB1 mutations responded to panitumumab. No patients responded to best supportive care alone. Panitumumab treatment was associated with longer progression-free survival (PFS) among wild-type KRAS (codons 12/13/61) patients [HR, 0.39; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.28-0.56]. Among wild-type KRAS patients, a treatment effect for PFS favoring panitumumab occurred in patients with wild-type NRAS (HR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.27-0.56) and wild-type BRAF (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.24-0.55) but not mutant NRAS (HR, 1.94; 95% CI, 0.44-8.44). These results show the feasibility and potential clinical use of next-generation sequencing for evaluating predictive biomarkers.",cancer
1906,Efinaconazole 10% and Tavaborole 5% Penetrate Across Poly-ureaurethane 16%: Results of In Vitro Release Testing and Clinical Implications of Onychodystrophy in Onychomycosis.,"Poly-ureaurethane has been previously described for the management of dry, brittle, and in general, dystrophic nails. The polymer yields a waterproof, breathable barrier to protect the nail plate and prevent further damage to the nail, while regulating transonychial water loss (TOWL). Because nail dystrophy and dessication are contributing factors to onychomycosis, a barrier that protects the nail but also allows a topical antifungal to permeate its shield is potentially an advantageous combination. Oral antifungals such as terbinafine, itraconazole, and fluconazole, as well as the newer topical antifungals efinaconazole and tavaborole (although formulated to penetrate the nail unit and work with the porosity and inherent electrical charge of the nail plate), do not take into account nail damage that has been created from years of harboring a dermatophyte infection. Up to 50% of cases presumed to be onychomycosis are in fact onychodystrophy without fungal infection, and laboratory testing for fungus should be obtained prior to initiating antifungal treatment. Whether a nail has onychomycosis, or onychodystrophy due to other causes, barrier function and structural integrity are compromised in diseased nails, and should be addressed. A poly-ureaurethane barrier that protects against wetting/drying, fungal reservoirs, and microtrauma, followed by the addition of oral or topical antifungals after laboratory fungal confirmation may optimize outcomes in the treatment of onychomycosis.<br/> OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this work was to determine through in vitro release testing (IVRT) whether poly-ureaurethane 16% allows for penetration of efinaconazole 10% or tavaborole 5%. Results could spur subsequent clinical studies which would have implications for the addition of an antifungal based on fungal confirmation, after addresssing the underlying nail dystrophy primarily.<br/> METHODS: A vertical diffusion cell system was used to evaluate the ability of efinaconazole 10% and tavaborole 5% to penetrate across poly-ureaurethane 16%. The diffusion cells had a 1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> surface area and approximately 8 mL receptor volume. Poly-ureaurethane 16% was applied to a 0.45 &mu;m nylon membrane and allowed to dry before use. Efinaconazole 10% or tavaborole 5% was then applied to the poly-ureaurethane 16% coated membrane, and samples were pulled from the receptor chamber at various times. Reverse phase chromatography was then used to assess the penetration of each active ingredient across the membrane.<br/> RESULTS: The flux and permeability of efinaconazole or tavaborole across poly-ureaurethane 16% were determined from efinaconazole 10% or tavaborole 5%, respectively. The flux and permeability of efinaconazole were determined to be 503.9 +/- 31.9 &mu;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/hr and 14.0 +/- 0.9 nm/sec. The flux and permeability of tavaborole were determined to be 755.5 +/- 290.4 &mu;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/hr and 42.0 +/- 16.1 nm/sec.<br/> CONCLUSION: In addition to the treatment of onychoschizia, onychorrhexis, and other signs of severe dessication of the nail plate, a barrier that regulates TOWL should be considered in the management onychomycosis to address barrier dysfunction and to promote stabilization of the damaged nail. Previously published flux values across the nail are reported to be 1.4 &mu;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/day for efinaconazole and 204 &mu;g/cm<sup>2</sup>/day for tavaborole. These values are substantially lower than the herein determined flux for both molecules across poly-ureaurethane 16%. A comparison of the data suggests that poly-ureaurethane 16%, if used prior to efinaconazole or tavaborole, would not limit the ability of either active ingredient to access the nail, and therefore, would be unlikely to reduce their antifungal effect. Onychodystrophy is inherent in, and often precedes onychomycosis, and consideration should be given for initiation of treatment in the same sequence: stabilizing and protecting the nail plate barrier primarily, and subsequently adding oral or topical antifungals after laboratory confirmation. Future clinical studies will be needed to determine combination efficacy for in vivo use. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1116-1120.",nonCancer

252,Prognostic value of TP53 gene mutations in myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia treated with azacitidine.,"TP53 mutations are found in 5-10% of MDS and AML, where they are generally associated with complex karyotype and an overall poor prognosis. However, the impact of TP53 mutations in MDS treated with azacitidine (AZA) remains unclear. We analyzed TP53 mutations in 62 patients with high risk MDS or AML treated with AZA. A TP53 mutation was found in 23 patients (37.1%), associated with complex karyotype in 18 (78.3%) of them. TP53 mutations had no significant impact on response or complete response to AZA (p=0.60 and p=0.26, respectively). By univariate analysis, OS was negatively influenced by the presence of TP53 mutation (median OS 12.4 months versus 23.7 months, p<10(-4)), abnormal cytogenetics (median OS 14.4 months vs 33 months, p=0.02) complex cytogenetics (median OS 12.7 months versus 23.7 months, p=0.0005), and a diagnosis of AML (median 14.5 months vs 21.2 months for MDS or CMML, p=0.02). By multivariate analysis, only TP53 mutational status (HR 2.89 (95% confidence interval 1.38-6.04; p=0.005) retained statistical significance for OS. Results were similar when the analysis was restricted to MDS and CMML patients, excluding AML (HR=2.46 (95% confidence interval: 1.1-6.4); p=0.04)). Thus, TP53 mutations strongly correlated with poorer survival in higher risk MDS and AML treated with AZA.",cancer
1816,Prevalence and Characterization of Oxacillin Susceptible mecA-Positive Clinical Isolates of Staphylococcus aureus Causing Bovine Mastitis in India.,"Bovine mastitis caused by multidrug resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a huge problem reported worldwide, resulting in prolonged antibiotic treatment and death of livestock. The current study is focused on surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility along with genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the pathogenic S. aureus strains causing mastitis in India. One hundred and sixty seven milk samples were collected from mastitis-affected cows from different farms in India resulting in thirty nine isolated S. aureus strains. Antibiotic sensitivity profiling revealed the majority of the strains (n = 24) to be multidrug resistant and eleven strains showed reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (MICs = 2μg/ml). All strains were oxacillin sensitive, but 19 strains were positive for the mecA gene, which revealed the occurrence of oxacillin susceptible mecA positive strains (OS-MRSA) for the first time from India. Additionally, 32 strains were positive for the pvl gene, a virulence determinant; of these 17 were also OS-MRSA strains. Molecular characterization based on multilocus sequence typing (MLST), spa typing, agr typing and SCCmec classification revealed strains belonging to different groups. Moreover, strains showed spa types (t2526, t9602) and MLST sequence types, ST-72, ST-88 and ST-239 which have been earlier reported in human infections. The prevalence of OS-MRSA strains indicates the importance of including both the genetic and phenotypic tests in characterizing S. aureus strains. Increased genotypic variability with strain related to human infections and pvl positive isolates indicates a worrisome situation with the possibility of bilateral transfer.",nonCancer
1763,Multiple Enchondromas of the Hand in Children: Long-Term Follow-Up of Mean 15.4 Years.,"Multiple enchodromatosis of bone, termed Ollier's disease, or Maffucci syndrome when associated with hemangiomas, is a rare disease that can affect the pediatric hand. This condition often causes a finger mass, deformity, pain and possible pathologic fractures, and has been associated with malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma. The aim of our study is to describe the long-term sequela of multiple enchondromatosis of the hand in the pediatric population, specifically the rates of malignant transformation, tumor recurrence, rates of pathologic fracture, and phalangeal growth arrest.|We examined 15 pediatric patients who were treated in our institute with a total of 127 phalanges and metacarpals lesions. Only patients with follow-up of at least 4 years were included. We retrospectively reviewed patients' chart and hand radiograph for symptoms including pathologic fractures, indications for surgery, and postoperative complications including tumor recurrence, and malignant transformation. We assessed phalangeal growth arrest with radiographs and normalized phalangeal growth charts.|Mean age of diagnosis was 5.8 years and mean follow-up time was 15.4 years. Pathologic fractures were common at 46% of pediatric patients, but ceased to occur once reaching adulthood. Outcomes of pathologic fractures were excellent, regardless of treatment. Malignant transformation occurred in 1 patient and did not occur during childhood. A total of 80% of patients and 29% of lesions underwent surgical treatment of curettage and bone graft for the lesion, yet recurrence was common and affected 33% of treated patients. Phalangeal growth arrest was the most common long-term sequela and affected 11% of phalanxes and metacarpals. This sequela was significantly more prevalent in patients who had surgical excision of the tumor.|Our findings reassure that malignant transformation of enchodromatosis of the hand is unlikely in the pediatric population. Pathologic fracture is common, but has excellent outcomes. When considering surgery, parents should be counseled about the possibility of phalangeal growth arrest and recurrence of the lesion.|Level IV-therapeutic.",nonCancer

Therapies with propranolol, baclofen, niaprazine, and diazepam were progressively uptitrated, indicating potential usefulness. When testing possible predictors of remission, we found positive effects of propranolol and diazepam and of traumatic etiology and a negative effect of maximum PSH severity.|Results should be interpreted carefully regarding causal relationships and drug doses and combinations, but they encourage further studies on the use of propranolol and diazepam to favor PSH remission.",nonCancer

603,Mechanisms of action and resistance to all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (As2O 3) in acute promyelocytic leukemia.,"Since the introduction of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (As2O3) for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the overall survival rate has improved dramatically. However, relapse/refractory patients showing resistance to ATRA and/or As2O3 are recognized as a clinically significant problem. Genetic mutations resulting in amino acid substitution in the retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARα) ligand binding domain (LBD) and the PML-B2 domain of PML-RARα, respectively, have been reported as molecular mechanisms underlying resistance to ATRA and As2O3. In the LBD mutation, ATRA binding with LBD is generally impaired, and ligand-dependent co-repressor dissociation and degradation of PML-RARα by the proteasome pathway, leading to cell differentiation, are inhibited. The PML-B2 mutation interferes with the direct binding of As2O3 with PML-B2, and PML-RARα SUMOylation with As2O3 followed by multimerization and degradation is impaired. To overcome ATRA resistance, utilization of As2O3 provides a preferable outcome, and recently, a synthetic retinoid Am80, which has a higher binding affinity with PML-RARα than ATRA, has been tested in the clinical setting. However, no strategy attempted to date has been successful in overcoming As2O3 resistance. Detailed genomic analyses using patient samples harvested repeatedly may help in predicting the prognosis, selecting the effective targeting drugs, and designing new sophisticated strategies for the treatment of APL.",cancer
105,"Molecular epidemiology of EGFR and KRAS mutations in 3,026 lung adenocarcinomas: higher susceptibility of women to smoking-related KRAS-mutant cancers.","The molecular epidemiology of most EGFR and KRAS mutations in lung cancer remains unclear. We genotyped 3,026 lung adenocarcinomas for the major EGFR (exon 19 deletions and L858R) and KRAS (G12, G13) mutations and examined correlations with demographic, clinical, and smoking history data. EGFR mutations were found in 43% of never smokers and in 11% of smokers. KRAS mutations occurred in 34% of smokers and in 6% of never smokers. In patients with smoking histories up to 10 pack-years, EGFR predominated over KRAS. Among former smokers with lung cancer, multivariate analysis showed that, independent of pack-years, increasing smoking-free years raise the likelihood of EGFR mutation. Never smokers were more likely than smokers to have KRAS G > A transition mutation (mostly G12D; 58% vs. 20%, P = 0.0001). KRAS G12C, the most common G > T transversion mutation in smokers, was more frequent in women (P = 0.007) and these women were younger than men with the same mutation (median 65 vs. 69, P = 0.0008) and had smoked less. The distinct types of KRAS mutations in smokers versus never smokers suggest that most KRAS-mutant lung cancers in never smokers are not due to second-hand smoke exposure. The higher frequency of KRAS G12C in women, their younger age, and lesser smoking history together support a heightened susceptibility to tobacco carcinogens.",cancer
993,De novo Alu element insertions targeted to a sequence common to the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.,"Linkage analysis suggests that mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are responsible for cancer predisposition in more than 80% of the families with high incidence of breast/ovarian cancer. However, pathogenic mutations in the BRCA1/2 genes are generally identified in much less than half of the families investigated in a diagnostic setting with the currently used PCR-based screening protocols. Here we report the identification of two different de novo Alu element insertions within the BRCA1/2 coding sequences in three out of the 50 families in which we found a cancer predisposing mutation, suggesting that this type of mutation is much more common than suggested by their occurrence in mutation databases. The Alu insertion in the BRCA2 gene resulted in the removal of the targeted exon from the corresponding mRNA molecule. Unexpectedly the Target Site Duplications generated by both Alu element insertions contained a specific 9 bp long segment, which might eventually serve as a recognition site for the transposition machinery. Finally, in contrast to the disease causing Alu insertions reported to date, the transposon identified in the BRCA1 gene does not belong to a ""young"" AluY but to an AluS subfamily, indicating that some of these ""old"" Alu elements, which are supposed to be non-functional fossil relics, are still able to retrotranspose in vivo.",cancer
2092,Scanning Electrochemical Microscopy of Carbon Nanomaterials and Graphite.,"Carbon materials are tremendously important as electrode materials in both fundamental and applied electrochemistry. Recently, significant attention has been given not only to traditional carbon materials, but also to carbon nanomaterials for various electrochemical applications in energy conversion and storage as well as sensing. Importantly, many of these applications require fast electron-transfer (ET) reactions between a carbon surface and a redox-active molecule in solution. It, however, has not been well understood how heterogeneous ET kinetics at a carbon/solution interface is affected by the electronic structure, defect, and contamination of the carbon surface. Problematically, it is highly challenging to measure the intrinsic electrochemical reactivity of a carbon surface, which is readily passivated by adventitious organic contaminants. This Account summarizes our recent studies of carbon nanomaterials and graphite by scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) not only to reveal the fast ET kinetics of simple ferrocene derivatives at their graphitic surfaces, but also to obtain mechanistic insights into their extraordinary electrochemical reactivity. Specifically, we implemented new principles and technologies to reliably and reproducibly enable nanoscale SECM measurements. We took advantage of a new SECM imaging principle to resolve the high reactivity of the sidewall of individual single walled carbon nanotubes. In addition, we developed SECM-based nanogap voltammetry to find that monolayer graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition yields an unprecedentedly high standard ET rate constant, k(0), of ≥25 cm/s, which was >1000 times higher than that reported in the literature. Remarkably, the nonideal asymmetry of paired nanogap voltammograms revealed that the high reactivity of graphitic surfaces is compromised by their contamination with airborne hydrocarbons. Most recently, we protected the clean surface of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite from the airborne contaminants during its exfoliation and handling by forming a water adlayer to obtain a reliable k(0) value of ≥12 cm/s from symmetric pairs of nanogap voltammograms. We envision that SECM of clean graphitic surfaces will enable us to reliably address not only effects of their electronic structures on their electrochemical reactivity, but also the activity of carbon-based or carbon-supported electrocatalysts for fuel cells and batteries.",nonCancer
1392,"Organ Mass Variation in a Toad Headed Lizard Phrynocephalus vlangalii in Response to Hypoxia and Low Temperature in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China.","Hypoxia and low temperature at high altitudes are the main environmental pressures for alpine animals, inducing phenotypic plasticity at several levels. To investigate the effect of these variables on the organ mass of Phrynocephalus vlangalii, 138 individuals belonging to four populations living along an altitudinal gradient in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (China) were dissected to remove heart, lungs, stomach, and intestinal tract. Organ dry mass, individuals' sex, and body mass, as well as mean annual temperature and average air pressure (calculated from a 30-year-data series obtained from the National Climatic Data Center) were subjected to two-way analyses of covariance and generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs). Except for the heart, organ mass varied significantly among populations, although only lung and stomach mass increased significantly with increasing altitude. Males' heart and lung mass was higher than that of females, which might be due to their different behavior and reproductive efforts. GLMM analyses indicated that air pressure had a positive effect on heart, lung and intestinal tract mass, whereas temperature had a negative effect on these three organs. In order to explain the effect of hypoxia and low temperature on P. vlangalii's organ mass, further rigorous study on respiration, energy budget and food intake was encouraged.",nonCancer

Average age of onset of FI was 48.6 (range, 22-74) years. Ten percent (n = 5) reported regular FI. Incontinence to flatus was seen in 33.3% (n = 16), to liquid faeces in 56.2% (n = 27), to solid faeces in 6.2% (n = 3) and to all three in 4.1% (n = 2). Twenty-one percent (n = 10) complained of disruption of their physical and social activity. There was no association between FI and type of IBD. Significant associations were found between FI and age (P = 0.005) and gender (P < 0.001). QOL in our cohort of patients was significantly affected by FI.|In our study, nearly a quarter of patients reported FI. There was a significant correlation between FI and QOL. Therefore, enquiring about FI in IBD patients can lead to identification of this debilitating condition. This will enable early referral for continence care in this group of patients.",nonCancer
2480,Tacrolimus combined with low-dose corticosteroids is an effective and safe therapeutic option for refractory IgA nephropathy.,"Tacrolimus (TAC) has been shown to improve remission from proteinuria in patients with refractory IgA nephropathy (IgAN); however, the efficacy and safety of TAC in such patients have not been fully explored. Therefore, the present study was conducted to evaluate the tolerance to and efficacy of TAC combined with low-dose corticosteroids in patients with refractory IgAN. This was a single-center retrospective study. A total of 28 patients with refractory IgAN were randomly included and received TAC plus corticosteroid; 26 patients received TAC and prednisone, and 2 patients received TAC and methylprednisolone. In addition, all patients were treated with an angiotensin inhibitor. Total urinary protein excretion, serum albumin, blood glucose, complete remission (CR), partial remission (PR), cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), serum creatinine (Scr) and estimated GFR (eGFR) were tested at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of treatment in all patients. The primary endpoints were CR and PR. Secondary endpoints included changes of Scr, eGFR, clinical data and adverse events. After 12 months, CR was achieved in 40.1% of patients and PR in 43.4%, yielding a total response rate of 83.5%, and the total urinary protein excretion, serum albumin, cholesterol and LDL results were improved significantly compared with those at baseline. Proteinuria and serum albumin results were significantly improved by month 3 of treatment. Two patients relapsed during months 3-6 of follow-up. At the 12-month follow-up, renal function was improved compared with the baseline level as evidenced by eGFR and Scr, respectively. The blood glucose level was stable. One case of pneumococcal pneumonia developed in a patient treated with TAC plus low-dose methylprednisolone and one case of upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage was found in a patient treated with TAC plus low-dose prednisone; both cases completely recovered after treatment. In conclusion, TAC combined with low-dose corticosteroids may be an effective and safe therapeutic option for the treatment of refractory IgAN. However, given the small number of patients in this study, further prospective randomized controlled trials are required with a larger sample of participants and longer follow-up period.",nonCancer
1114,[Association between GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and therapeutic efficacy of tyrosine kinase inhibitor in pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer with unknown EGFR mutation status].,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-activating mutation predicts excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). However, lung cancer patients are often with unknown EGFR mutation status because there are little tumor specimen to determine. TKIs induce tumor cell apoptosis which associates with several apoptosis-related genes. To explore the association between GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and therapeutic efficacy of TKI in pretreated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC) with unknown EGFR mutation status. A total of 116 patients were recruited for the study from Zhejiang Cancer Hospital, all of whom were treated with gefitinib or erlotinib after failure to prior chemotherapy. We detected the genotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients with GNAS1 T393C polymorphism through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Statistical analysis was performed by SPSS version 18.0. The overall response rate was 29.3%. No significant associations were found among GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and the objective response rate. The disease control rate of patients with GNAS1 T393C CC genotype was lower than that of patients with variant genotype (TT or CT) (46.2% vs 73.8%, P=0.039). Univariate analysis identified gender, smoking history, histology and GNAS1 T393C polymorphism as predictive marker of PFS (P=0.04, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P=0.005). Multivariate analysis of factors, including smoking history, performance status score, histology, GNAS1 T393C polymorphism demonstrated that GNAS1 T393C polymorphism was correlated independently with PFS (P=0.007). Our data suggest the role of GNAS1 T393C CC genotype as a poor predictive marker both of DCR and PFS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitor.",cancer
275,PTEN deficiency is associated with reduced sensitivity to mTOR inhibitor in human bladder cancer through the unhampered feedback loop driving PI3K/Akt activation.,"Preclinical studies have shown that PTEN loss enhances sensitivity to mammalian target of Rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors because of facilitated PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase)/Akt activation and consecutive stimulation of the mTOR pathway. In patients with advanced transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) treated with the mTOR inhibitor everolimus, PTEN loss was, however, associated with resistance to treatment. Transitional cell carcinoma specimens, human bladder cancer cells and derived mouse xenografts were used to evaluate how the PTEN status influences the activity of mTOR inhibitors. Transitional cell carcinoma patients with a shorter progression-free survival under everolimus exhibited PTEN deficiency and increased Akt activation. Moreover, PTEN-deficient bladder cancer cells were less sensitive to rapamycin than cells expressing wild-type PTEN, and rapamycin strikingly induced Akt activation in the absence of functional PTEN. Inhibition of Akt activation by the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin interrupted this rapamycin-induced feedback loop, thereby enhancing the antiproliferative effects of the mTOR inhibitor both in vitro and in vivo. Facilitation of Akt activation upon PTEN loss can have a more prominent role in driving the feedback loop in response to mTOR inhibition than in promoting the mTOR pathway. These data support the use of both PI3K and mTOR inhibitors to treat urothelial carcinoma, in particular in the absence of functional PTEN.",cancer
2214,Artificial cilia as autonomous nanoactuators: Design of a gradient self-oscillating polymer brush with controlled unidirectional motion.,"A gradient self-oscillating polymer brush surface with ordered, autonomous, and unidirectional ciliary motion has been designed. The self-oscillating polymer is a random copolymer composed of N-isopropylacrylamide and ruthenium tris(2,2'-bipyridine) [Ru(bpy)3], which acts as a catalyst for an oscillating chemical reaction, the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction. The target polymer brush surface was designed to have a thickness gradient by using sacrificial-anode atom transfer radical polymerization. The gradient structure of the polymer brush was confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy. These analyses revealed that the thickness of the polymer brush was in the range of several tens of nanometers, and the amount of Ru(bpy)3 increased as the thickness increased. The gradient polymer brush induced a unidirectional propagation of the chemical wave from the region with small Ru(bpy)3 amounts to the region with large Ru(bpy)3 amounts. This spatiotemporal control of the ciliary motion would be useful in potential applications to functional surface such as autonomous mass transport systems.",nonCancer

Kaplan-Meier estimates and Cox proportional hazards modeling were used to calculate the probability of retention at one year and identify predictors of non-retention.|Among 5,683 adults (age ≥ 15) who linked to care, 95.5% (95% CI: 92.9 - 98.1%) were retained in care at 12 months. The overall probability of retention at one year was 89.3% (95% CI: 87.6 - 90.7%) among patients newly linking to care and 96.4% (95% CI: 95.8 - 97.0%) among patients previously in care. Younger age and pre-ART CD4 below country treatment initiation guidelines were predictors of non-retention among all patients. Among those newly linking, taking more than 30 days to link to care after HIV diagnosis was additionally associated with non-retention at one year. HIV viral load suppression at 12 months was observed in 4,227/4736 (89%) of patients retained with valid viral load results.|High retention in care and viral suppression after 1 year were achieved in a streamlined HIV care delivery system in the context of a universal test-and-treat intervention.",nonCancer
1739,In the Shadow of Fibrosis: Innate Immune Suppression Mediated by Transforming Growth Factor Beta.,"Transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) regulates cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and matrix homeostasis and is intimately involved in fibrosis. TGFB expression is increased in fibrotic lung diseases such as idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) but also in chronic inflammatory conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. In addition to profibrotic activities, the molecule also exhibits profound immune-suppressive actions involving both innate and adaptive responses, but this aspect of TGFB biology is often overlooked. Recent investigations have demonstrated that TGFB blunts innate interferon (IFN) responses. This can enable severe virus infections and secondary bacterial infections that may last longer with augmented inflammation, scarring, fibrosis and loss of lung function. Strategies to oppose TGFB actions or to enhance IFN responses may help to ameliorate detrimental consequences of initial virus infection in patients with diseases characterized by TGFB overexpression, inflammation and fibrosis.",nonCancer

Few studies have clearly evaluated immunological relationships between immunoglobulin E (IgE) and immunoglobulin G (IgG)-binding epitopes of α-lactalbumin. IgE- and IgG-binding epitopes were immunolabeled with individual sera from cow milk-allergic patients. Alanine scanning of immunodominant epitopes was used to identify the critical amino acid (aa). Our initial data revealed Val(8) , Phe(9) , Arg(10) , Tyr(103) , Leu(105) , and His(107) were the critical aa for IgE-binding epitope. The critical aa of IgG-binding epitopes were Phe(9) , Leu(15) , Pro(24) , Trp(26) , and His(32) . This study will provide necessary information to alter the cDNA to encode a protein capable of activating milk-specific T cells, but with reduced IgE- or IgG-binding capacity.",nonCancer
766,Phase II clinical trial of sorafenib in metastatic medullary thyroid cancer.,"Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) activity are critical in the pathogenesis of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor targeting Ret and VEGFR, showed antitumor activity in preclinical studies of MTC. In this phase II trial of sorafenib in patients with advanced MTC, the primary end point was objective response. Secondary end points included toxicity assessment and response correlation with tumor markers, functional imaging, and RET mutations. Using a two-stage design, 16 or 25 patients were to be enrolled onto arms A (hereditary) and B (sporadic). Patients received sorafenib 400 mg orally twice daily. Of 16 patients treated in arm B, one achieved partial response (PR; 6.3%; 95% CI, 0.2% to 30.2%), 14 had stable disease (SD; 87.5%; 95% CI, 61.7% to 99.5%), and one was nonevaluable. In a post hoc analysis of 10 arm B patients with progressive disease (PD) before study, one patient had PR of 21+ months, four patients had SD >or= 15 months, four patients had SD <or= 6 months, and one patient had clinical PD. Median progression-free survival was 17.9 months. Arm A was prematurely terminated because of slow accrual. Common adverse events (AEs) included diarrhea, hand-foot-skin reaction, rash, and hypertension. Although serious AEs were rare, one death was seen. Tumor markers decreased in the majority of patients, and RET mutations were detected in 10 of 12 sporadic MTCs analyzed. Sorafenib is reasonably well tolerated, with suggestion of clinical benefit for patients with sporadic MTC. Caution should be taken because of the rare but fatal toxicity potentially associated with sorafenib.",cancer
794,Improved overall survival in melanoma with combined dabrafenib and trametinib.,"The BRAF inhibitors vemurafenib and dabrafenib have shown efficacy as monotherapies in patients with previously untreated metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Combining dabrafenib and the MEK inhibitor trametinib, as compared with dabrafenib alone, enhanced antitumor activity in this population of patients. In this open-label, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 704 patients with metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation to receive either a combination of dabrafenib (150 mg twice daily) and trametinib (2 mg once daily) or vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily) orally as first-line therapy. The primary end point was overall survival. At the preplanned interim overall survival analysis, which was performed after 77% of the total number of expected events occurred, the overall survival rate at 12 months was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 67 to 77) in the combination-therapy group and 65% (95% CI, 59 to 70) in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio for death in the combination-therapy group, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.89; P=0.005). The prespecified interim stopping boundary was crossed, and the study was stopped for efficacy in July 2014. Median progression-free survival was 11.4 months in the combination-therapy group and 7.3 months in the vemurafenib group (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46 to 0.69; P<0.001). The objective response rate was 64% in the combination-therapy group and 51% in the vemurafenib group (P<0.001). Rates of severe adverse events and study-drug discontinuations were similar in the two groups. Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma and keratoacanthoma occurred in 1% of patients in the combination-therapy group and 18% of those in the vemurafenib group. Dabrafenib plus trametinib, as compared with vemurafenib monotherapy, significantly improved overall survival in previously untreated patients with metastatic melanoma with BRAF V600E or V600K mutations, without increased overall toxicity.

However, the mechanism of energy metabolism in the follicular lumen of the thyroid remains unknown. In the present study, the three dimensional structure of thyroid follicles was constructed using a primary culture of swine cells and the follicular protein was identified via matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. Three glycolysis-associated enzymes, enolase, pyruvate kinase and phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase were identified in addition to TG. These results support the hypothesis that anaerobic glycolysis of glucose exists in the follicle and supports energy consumption for hormone synthesis.",nonCancer
1838,Phytoextraction of heavy metals from municipal sewage sludge by Rosa multiflora and Sida hermaphrodita.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of the multiflora rose var. 'Jatar' (Rosa multiflora Thunb. ex Mur) and the Virginia fanpetals (Sida hermaphrodita Rusby) to phytoextract heavy metals from municipal sewage sludge. The 6-year field experiment involved four levels of fertilization with sewage sludge at doses of 0, 10, 20, 40, and 60 Mg DM sludge · ha(-1). The increasing doses of sewage sludge were found to increase significantly the yield of multiflora rose and Virginia fanpetals biomass. They also significantly elevated the content of heavy metals in these plants. The highest uptake of heavy metals by the multiflora rose and Virginia fanpetals crops was recorded at the fertilisation dose of 60 Mg DM · ha(-1). Our investigations show that the Virginia fanpetals was more efficient in phytoextraction of Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Cd from the sewage sludge than the multiflora rose, due to the greater yields and higher heavy metal uptake by the former plant. In turn, the multiflora rose phytoextracted greater amounts of Pb from the sewage sludge. The analyses indicate that the Virginia fanpetals can be used for phytoremediation (phytoextraction) of heavy metals contained in sewage sludge.",nonCancer
1546,Screening for Critical Congenital Heart Defects with Pulse Oximetry: Medical Aspects.,"The detection of newborn babies with potentially life-threatening, critical congenital heart defects (CCHDs) before they collapse or expire remains an important clinical challenge. The absence of physical signs and the difficulty assessing mild cyanosis means that the newborn baby check misses up to a third of babies. Fetal anomaly ultrasound scanning identifies an increasing proportion, but this screen is operator-dependent and therefore highly variable; although some units report very high detection rates, overall most babies with CCHD are still missed. Pulse oximetry screening (POS) is an additional test that meets the criteria for universal screening. POS increases overall detection of CCHD to over 90% and also identifies babies with noncardiac, hypoxemic conditions (such as congenital pneumonia, early-onset sepsis, and pulmonary hypertension), which are usually included in the false positives. There is a wealth of published data on the POS, both in a research setting and more recently in routine clinical practice, and consideration of POS is becoming increasingly widespread particularly among high-income countries. But a degree of controversy still remains, and debate continues regarding the most appropriate time to screen, the most effective screening pathway, and screening outside the well-baby nursery. So, should all newborn babies be screened with POS, if so, when and where should screening take place, what saturations are acceptable, and which conditions are we trying to identify? This review will look at the available evidence and try to suggest the way forward for those considering its introduction into their clinical practice.",nonCancer
568,"Acute myeloid leukemia: 2012 update on diagnosis, risk stratification, and management.","Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) results from accumulation of abnormal immature cells in the marrow. These cells interfere with normal hematopoiesis can escape into the blood and infiltrate lung and CNS. The most common cause of death is bone marrow failure. It is likely that many different mutations and/or epigenetic aberrations can produce the same disease, with these differences responsible for the very variable response to therapy, which is AML's principal clinical feature. This rests on demonstration that the marrow or blood has >20% blasts of myeloid lineage. Blast lineage is assessed by multiparameter flow cytometry with CD33 and CD13 being surface markers typically expressed by myeloid blasts. It should be realized that clinical/prognostic considerations, not the blast % per se, should be the main factor determining how a patient is treated. Two features determine risk: the probability of treatment-related mortality (TRM) and, more important, even in patients aged >75 with Zubrod performance status 1, the probability of resistance to standard therapy despite not incurring TRM. The chief predictor of resistance is cytogenetics with a monosomal karyotype (MK) denoting the disease is essentially incurable with standard therapy even if followed by a standard allogeneic transplant (HCT). The most common cytogenetic finding is a normal karyotype (NK) and those of such patients with an NPM1 mutation but no FLT3 internal tandem duplication (ITD), or with a CEBPA mutation, have a prognosis similar to that of patients with the most favorable cytogenetics [inv(16) or t(8;21)] (60-70% cure rate). In contrast, NK patients with a FLT3 ITD have only a 30-40% chance of cure even after HCT. Accordingly analyses of NPM1, FLT3, and CEBPA should be part of routine evaluation, much as is cytogenetics. Risk is best assessed considering several variables simultaneously rather than, for example, only age. Patients with inv(16) or t(8;21) or who are NPM1+/FLT3ITD- can receive standard therapy (daunorubicin + cytarabine) and should not receive HCT in first CR. It seems likely that use of a daily daunorubicin dose of 90 mg/m(2) will further improve outcome in these patients. There appears no reason to use doses of cytarabine > 1 g/m(2) (for example, bid × 6 days), as opposed to the more commonly used 3 g/m(2) . Patients with an unfavorable karyotype (particularly MK) are unlikely to benefit from standard therapy (even with dose escalation) and are thus prime candidates for clinical trials of new drugs or new approaches to HCT; the latter should be done in first CR. Patients with intermediate prognoses (for example, NK and NPM and FLT3ITD negative) should also receive HCT in first CR and can plausibly receive either investigational or standard induction therapy, with the same prognostic information about standard therapy leading one patient to choose the standard and another an investigational option.",cancer
686,The dominant role of G12C over other KRAS mutation types in the negative prediction of efficacy of epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer.,"The role of KRAS mutations in molecular targeted therapy by epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been fully understood. The present investigation is aimed at an elucidation of the role of specific KRAS mutation types in predicting outcomes of patients with advanced NSCLC receiving EGFR-TKI therapy. Initially, 448 NSCLC patients were tested for the presence of KRAS mutations, to obtain frequencies of specific KRAS mutation types. Subsequently, the clinical outcome of treatment was evaluated in a subgroup of 38 KRAS-positive patients receiving EGFR-TKI therapy. KRAS mutations were detected in 69 of 448 patients (15.4%), mostly in smokers (17.86% vs. 5.8%, P = 0.0048), and appeared more frequently in adenocarcinomas than in squamous cell NSCLC or NSCLC that is not otherwise specified (21% vs. 6.99% vs. 4.4%, P = 0.0004). The most frequent type of KRAS mutation was G12C. The progression-free survival (PFS) was doubled in a group of non-G12C patients compared with that of the G12C group (9.0 wk vs. 4.3 wk, P = 0.009). The overall survival (OS) was not significantly different between non-G12C and G12C groups (12.1 wk vs. 9.3 wk, P = 0.068). The G12C KRAS mutation is a strong negative predictor for EGFR-TKI treatment, whereas other KRAS mutation types have not negatively predicted treatment efficacy compared with that for the wild-type KRAS genotype.",cancer

Osimertinib has been designed to target the EGFR T790M mutation that is often present in NSCLC patients with acquired EGFR TKI resistance, while sparing wild-type EGFR. In November 2015, the tablet formulation of osimertinib was granted accelerated approval in the USA for the treatment of patients with metastatic EGFR T790M mutation-positive NSCLC (as detected by an FDA-approved test) who have progressed on or after EGFR TKI therapy. Osimertinib has also been granted accelerated assessment status for this indication in the EU, and is in phase III development for first- and second-line and adjuvant treatment of advanced EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC in several countries. Phase I trials in patients with advanced solid tumours are also being conducted. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of osimertinib leading to this first approval for NSCLC.",cancer
2046,MreB Orientation Correlates with Cell Diameter in Escherichia coli.,"Bacteria have remarkably robust cell shape control mechanisms. For example, cell diameter only varies by a few percent across a given population. The bacterial actin homolog, MreB, is necessary for establishment and maintenance of rod shape although the detailed properties of MreB that are important for shape control remained unknown. In this study, we perturb MreB in two ways: by treating cells with the polymerization-inhibiting drug A22 and by creating point mutants in mreB. These perturbations modify the steady-state diameter of cells over a wide range, from 790 ± 30 nm to 1700 ± 20 nm. To determine which properties of MreB are important for diameter control, we correlated structural characteristics of fluorescently tagged MreB polymers with cell diameter by simultaneously analyzing three-dimensional images of MreB and cell shape. Our results indicate that the helical pitch angle of MreB inversely correlates with the cell diameter of Escherichia coli. Other correlations between MreB and cell diameter are not found to be significant. These results demonstrate that the physical properties of MreB filaments are important for shape control and support a model in which MreB organizes the cell wall growth machinery to produce a chiral cell wall structure and dictate cell diameter.",nonCancer
2324,Effect of wetland management: are lentic wetlands refuges of plant-species diversity in the Andean-Orinoco Piedmont of Colombia?,"Accelerated degradation of the wetlands and fragmentation of surrounding vegetation in the Andean-Orinoco Piedmont are the main threats to diversity and ecological integrity of these ecosystems; however, information on this topic is of limited availability. In this region, we evaluated the value of 37 lentic wetlands as reservoirs of woody and aquatic plants and analyzed diversity and changes in species composition within and among groups defined according to management given by: (1) type (swamps, heronries, rice fields, semi-natural lakes, constructed lakes and fish farms) and (2) origins (natural, mixed and artificial). A total of 506 plant species were recorded: 80% woody and 20% aquatic. Of these, 411 species (81%) were considered species typical of the area (Meta Piedmont distribution). Diversity patterns seem to be driven by high landscape heterogeneity and wetland management. The fish farms presented the highest diversity of woody plants, while swamps ranked highest for aquatic plant diversity. Regarding wetland origin, the artificial systems were the most diverse, but natural wetlands presented the highest diversity of typical species and can therefore be considered representative ecosystems at the regional scale. Our results suggest that lentic wetlands act as refuges for native vegetation of Meta Piedmont forest, hosting 55% of the woody of Piedmont species and 29% of the aquatic species of Orinoco basin. The wetlands showed a high species turnover and the results indicated that small wetlands (mean ± SD: size = 11 ± 18.7 ha), with a small area of surrounding forest (10 ± 8.6 ha) supported high local and regional plant diversity. To ensure long-term conservation of lentic wetlands, it is necessary to develop management and conservation strategies that take both natural and created wetlands into account.",nonCancer

For the synthesis of the CF3 -labeled RNAs, phosphoramidite building blocks of 2'-O-[(4-CF3 -triazol-1-yl)methyl] nucleosides (cytidine, adenosine, and guanosine) were prepared and used as an integral part of the standard solid-phase RNA synthesis. The obtained (19) F NMR spectra supported the usual characterization data (obtained by UV- and CD-melting profiles and by (1) H NMR spectra of the imino regions) and additionally gave more detailed information on the Qd/Hp transitions. The molar fractions of the secondary structural species (Qd, Hp) upon thermal denaturation and under varying ionic conditions could be determined from the intensities and shifts of the (19) F NMR signals. For a well-behaved Qd/Hp transition, thermodynamic parameters could be extracted.",nonCancer
2470,Significance of the hedgehog pathway-associated proteins Gli-1 and Gli-2 and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition-associated proteins Twist and E-cadherin in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"It has been found that abnormal activation of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway is involved in the occurrence, invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. In addition, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) also performs an important function in the invasion and metastasis of malignant tumors. However, the significance of the Hh signaling pathway and EMT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. In the present study, the expression of Gli family zinc finger 1 (Gli-1) and Gli family zinc finger 2 (Gli-2), which are key transcriptional factors in the Hh signaling pathway, and Twist and E-cadherin, which are two factors involved in EMT, was examined in 42 patients with HCC and 20 cases of non-tumorous liver (NTL) tissue by immunohistochemistry. Clinicopathological information was collected in order to analyze the correlation of the Hh signaling pathway with EMT. The present study aimed to examine the difference in the expression of Gli-1, Gli-2, E-cadherin and Twist in HCC and NTL to assess the diagnostic value of these factors in HCC. Additionally, the present study aimed to elucidate the correlation between those proteins and other clinicopathological parameters. Whether abnormal activation of the Hh signaling pathway is closely associated with EMT was also evaluated. Gli-1 and Twist expression was found to be significantly increased and E-cadherin expression was found to be decreased in HCC in contrast to NTL (Gli-1, P=0.019; Twist, P=0.003; E-cadherin, P<0.001). Increased Twist expression was associated with the tumor size (P=0.043), and loss of or decreased E-cadherin expression was associated with the histological type of HCC (P=0.021). There was an inverse association between the expression of Twist and E-cadherin (P=0.006). These results showed that Twist overexpression by induction of EMT changes is involved in the occurrence and progression of HCC. However, the role of Hh signaling pathway-associated proteins in HCC may require elucidation by additional studies using additional materials in the future.",nonCancer
226,The FOXL2 C134W mutation is characteristic of adult granulosa cell tumors of the ovary.,"Granulosa cell tumors of the ovary represent ∼5% of malignant ovarian cancers. It has recently been reported that 95-97% of adult granulosa cell tumors carry a unique somatic mutation in the FOXL2 gene. We undertook this study to verify the presence of the FOXL2 Cys134Trp mutation in two geographically independent cohorts of granulosa cell tumors and to examine the expression pattern of FOXL2 in these tumors. A total of 56 tumors with the histological diagnosis of adult granulosa cell tumor from two centers, Melbourne and Helsinki, were examined for the presence of the mutation using direct sequence analysis. Two granulosa cell tumor-derived cell lines, COV434 and KGN, three juvenile granulosa cell tumors and control tissues were also examined. The expression of the FOXL2 gene was determined using quantitative RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemistry. We found that 52 of the 56 adult granulosa cell tumors harbor the mutation, of which three were hemi/homozygous. Of the four cases with wild-type FOXL2 sequence, reappraisal suggests that three may have been misclassified at primary diagnosis. The KGN cells were heterozygous for the mutation, whereas the COV434 cells had a wild-type FOXL2 genotype. The expression levels of FOXL2 were similar across the adult granulosa cell tumors and the normal ovary controls; one mutation-negative granulosa cell tumor had high FOXL2 mRNA levels, whereas the COV434 cells and two of the three juvenile granulosa cell tumors lacked the expression of FOXL2. Our data provide confirmation of the frequent presence of the FOXL2 C134W mutation in adult granulosa cell tumors and demonstrate that the mutation is not associated with altered FOXL2 expression. The mutation analysis may be a useful tool to differentiate particularly between cell-rich diffuse granulosa cell tumors and mitotically active sex cord-stromal tumors. This unique FOXL2 mutation appears to be characteristic of adult granulosa cell tumors.",cancer
1389,Early Changes in Monocyte Adhesion Molecule Expression and Tumor Necrosis Factor-α Levels in Chronic Kidney Disease - A 5-Year Prospective Study.,"Despite the absence of clinical symptoms, patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit elevated levels of pro-inflammatory markers. To investigate whether it is possible to detect inflammatory activity and altered monocyte function at an early stage of renal disease, we studied patients with CKD stages 2-3 over 5 years.|The expression of adhesion molecules on monocytes at resting state and after stimulation with formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP), as well as oxidative metabolism capacity was measured with flow cytometry in 108 CKD patients and healthy controls. Soluble markers of inflammation, such as cytokines, were analyzed using the Milliplex technique.|Patients showed significantly lower CD11b expression after stimulation during the 3rd (p = 0.002) and the 5th year (p < 0.001), together with a lower oxidative burst in response to fMLP over time (p = 0.02). The expression of CD62L on resting monocytes was lower during the 3rd (p = 0.001) and the 5th (p = 0.001) year in patients. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-α and RANTES were significantly increased (p = 0.001, p = 0.006) and interleukin-12 levels were also higher in CKD patients during the 5th year (p = 0.007).|Monocytes in CKD stages 2-3 show emerging functional abrasions, with altered adhesion molecule expression and impaired fMLP response. These findings suggest that a transformation of monocyte function occurs at an early phase of renal impairment and may together with increased plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines contribute to the higher vulnerability of CKD patients to comorbidities, such as infections and cardiovascular disease.",nonCancer
140,Accelerated degradation of PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (PML-RARA) oncoprotein by all-trans-retinoic acid in acute promyelocytic leukemia: possible role of the proteasome pathway.,"Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is associated with a chromosomal translocation t(15;17) and successfully differentiated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) in vivo as well as in vitro. The PML-retinoic acid receptor alpha (RARA) oncoprotein, which is generated by the translocation, blocks the differentiation, and ATRA is thought to modulate the dominant negative function of PML-RARA. However, the molecular effect of ATRA on PML-RARA is unknown. In this study, we showed by means of immunoblotting that the expression of PML-RARA decreased within 12 h in APL cells treated with ATRA at concentrations greater than 0.1 microM. The decrease of PML-RARA was associated with restoration of the normal subcellular PML localization. PML-RARA transcripts were not down-regulated by ATRA. However, lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the proteasome, almost completely inhibited the decrease of PML-RARA. These data indicate that the PML-RARA degradation is accelerated by pharmacological concentrations of ATRA, suggesting that ATRA allows APL cells to differentiate by relieving the differentiation block.",cancer
207,"AURORA-A amplification overrides the mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint, inducing resistance to Taxol.","The serine-threonine kinase gene AURORA-A is commonly amplified in epithelial malignancies. Here we show that elevated Aurora-A expression at levels that reflect cancer-associated gene amplification overrides the checkpoint mechanism that monitors mitotic spindle assembly, inducing resistance to the chemotherapeutic agent paclitaxel (Taxol). Cells overexpressing Aurora-A inappropriately enter anaphase despite defective spindle formation, and the persistence of Mad2 at the kinetochores, marking continued activation of the spindle assembly checkpoint. Mitosis is subsequently arrested by failure to complete cytokinesis, resulting in multinucleation. This abnormality is relieved by an inhibitory mutant of BUB1, linking the mitotic abnormalities provoked by Aurora-A overexpression to spindle checkpoint activity. Consistent with this conclusion, elevated Aurora-A expression causes resistance to apoptosis induced by Taxol in a human cancer cell line.",cancer
1073,"Microsatellite deletion mapping on chromosome 10q and mutation analysis of MMAC1, FAS, and MXI1 in human glioblastoma multiforme.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is an end-stage brain tumor of glial origin. Allelic deletions encompassing all or part of chromosome 10q occur frequently in GBMs, indicating that loss of one or more tumor suppressor genes on 10q plays a role in GBM formation. One of these genes is MMAC1 (PTEN), a gene on 10q23 which encodes a dual-specificity protein phosphatase. We carried out a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) analysis of 66 GBM patients using microsatellite markers for 27 loci on 10q. Overall, LOH was detected in 70% of cases, most showing LOH with every informative marker. Eleven patients showed partial 10q deletions, the smallest spanning a 35 cM region distal to D10S187. Sequence analysis of the MMAC1 gene in 45 of these tumors revealed mutations in eleven cases (24%), all with LOH on 10q. None of these mutations was present in normal DNA from the same patients. In addition, we utilized SSCP analysis to test two other candidate genes on 10q: FAS, a cell surface receptor which transduces an apoptotic, cell death signal and MXI1, a transcriptional repressor. The absence of mutations in these genes suggested that FAS and MXI1 are not likely to be tumor suppressor genes physiologically relevant to GBM. These data do support a significant role for MMAC1 in GBM.",cancer
1222,Resistance to Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors in Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are the most common type of sarcoma in the gastrointestinal tract. Surgery is the primary treatment modality, but many patients suffer disease recurrence or metastasis. Fortunately, the management of advanced GIST has been revolutionized by the use of small molecule kinase inhibitors that target the underlying pathogenetic mutant kinases found in the vast majority of cases. Approximately 85% of GISTs have oncogenic mutations in KIT, allowing for constitutive kinase activation that is responsible for cellular proliferation and survival. About 5 to 7% of GISTs have activating mutations of the homologous platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinase. The progression-free and overall survival of patients with advanced disease is greatly improved by treatment with the kinase inhibitors imatinib and sunitinib. However, the emergence of drug-resistant tumor clones limits the long-term benefit of these drugs in most patients. Resistance to these kinase inhibitors is associated with distinctive clinical and molecular features, with the development of secondary mutations of the oncogenic kinase being the most common mechanism. We review the molecular basis of GIST response and/or resistance to TKIs, and discuss strategies to prevent and/or overcome drug resistance. These concepts are directly relevant to the development of targeted molecular therapy for other solid tumors. (Clin Cancer Res 2009;15(24):7510-8).",cancer

124,The impact of human EGFR kinase domain mutations on lung tumorigenesis and in vivo sensitivity to EGFR-targeted therapies.,"To understand the role of human epidermal growth factor receptor (hEGFR) kinase domain mutations in lung tumorigenesis and response to EGFR-targeted therapies, we generated bitransgenic mice with inducible expression in type II pneumocytes of two common hEGFR mutants seen in human lung cancer. Both bitransgenic lines developed lung adenocarcinoma after sustained hEGFR mutant expression, confirming their oncogenic potential. Maintenance of these lung tumors was dependent on continued expression of the EGFR mutants. Treatment with small molecule inhibitors (erlotinib or HKI-272) as well as prolonged treatment with a humanized anti-hEGFR antibody (cetuximab) led to dramatic tumor regression. These data suggest that persistent EGFR signaling is required for tumor maintenance in human lung adenocarcinomas expressing EGFR mutants.",cancer

Considering the application of this technique as a very efficient method for drug, oligonucleotide, antibody and plasmid delivery for clinical applications and production of transgenic animals, the present study aimed to optimize the transfection efficiency of sheep testicular cells including spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) via electroporation.|This study is an experimental research conducted in Biotechnology Research Center (Avicenna Research Institute, Tehran, Iran) from September 2013 to March 2014. Following isolation and propagation of one-month lamb testicular cells (SSCs and somatic testicular cells including; Sertoli, Leydig, and myoid cells), the effect of different electroporation parameters including total voltages (280, 320, and 350 V), burst durations (10, 8, and 5 milliseconds), burst modes (single or double) and addition of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) were evaluated on transfection efficiency, viability rate and mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) of sheep testicular cells.|The most transfection efficiency was obtained in 320 V/8 milliseconds/single burst group in transduction medium with and without DMSO. There was a significantly inverse correlation between transfection efficiency with application of both following parameters: addition of DMSO and double burst. After transfection, the highest and lowest viability rates of testicular cells were demonstrated in 320 V/8 milliseconds with transduction medium without DMSO and 350 V/5 milliseconds in medium containing DMSO. Ad- dition of DMSO to transduction medium in all groups significantly decreased the viability rate. The comparison of gene expression indicated that Sertoli and SSCs had the most fluorescence intensity in 320 V/double burst/DMSO positive. However, myoid and Leydig cells showed the maximum expression in 320 V/single burst and/or 350 V/double burst/ DMSO positive.|We optimized the electroporation method for transfection of sheep testicular cells and recommended the application of 320 V/8 milliseconds/single pulse/DMSO negative for transduction of plasmid vector into these cells.

1917,The clock gene PER1 plays an important role in regulating the clock gene network in human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells.,"The various clock genes in normal cells, through their interaction, establish a number of positive and negative feedback loops that compose a network structure. These genes play an important role in regulating normal physiological activities. The expression of clock gene PER1 is decreased in many types of cancer. PER1 is highly correlated with the initiation and progression of cancer by regulating numerous downstream genes. However, it is still unclear whether the lower expression of PER1 in cancer can influence the expression of other clock genes in the clock gene network. In this study, we used short hairpin RNA interference to knock down PER1 effectively in SCC15 human oral squamous cell carcinoma cells. These cancer cells later were subcutaneously injected into the back of nude mice. We discovered that after PER1 knockdown, apoptosis was decreased and cell proliferation and in vivo tumor formation were enhanced. Quantitative real-time PCR result indicated that in vitro and in vivo cancer cells after PER1 knockdown, PER2, DEC1, DEC2, CRY1, CRY2 and NPAS2 were significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level, while PER3, TIM, RORα and REV-ERBα were significantly up-regulated. It prompts that the role of PER1 in carcinogenesis is exerted not only by regulating downstream genes, but also through the synergistic dysregulation of many other clock genes in the clock gene network.",nonCancer
935,Targeted therapy by combined inhibition of the RAF and mTOR kinases in malignant spindle cell neoplasm harboring the KIAA1549-BRAF fusion protein.,"Oncologic patients who are extreme responders to molecularly targeted therapy provide an important opportunity to better understand the biologic basis of response and, in turn, inform clinical decision making. Malignant neoplasms with an uncertain histologic and immunohistochemical characterization present challenges both on initial diagnostic workups and then later in management, as current treatment algorithms are based on a morphologic diagnosis. Herein, we report a case of a difficult to characterize sarcoma-like lesion for which genomic profiling with clinical next generation sequencing (NGS) identified the molecular underpinnings of arrested progression(stable disease) under combination targeted therapy within a phase I clinical trial. Genomic profiling with clinical next generation sequencing was performed on the FoundationOne™ platform (Foundation Medicine, Cambridge MA). Histopathology and immunohistochemical studies were performed in the Department of Pathology, MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Treatment was administered in the context of a phase I clinical trial ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: (NCT01187199). The histology of the tumor was that of a spindle cell neoplasm, grade 2 by FNCLCC standards. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for S100 and CD34. Genomic profiling identified the following alterations: a KIAA1549-BRAF gene fusion resulting from a tandem duplication event, a homozygous deletion of PTEN, and frameshift insertion/deletions in CDKN2A A68fs*51, SUFU E283fs*3, and MAP3K1 N325fs*3. The patient had a 25% reduction in tumor (RECIST v1.1) following combination therapy consisting of sorafenib, temsirolimus, and bevazicumab within a phase I clinical trial. The patient responded to combination targeted therapy that fortuitously targeted KIAA1549-BRAF and PTEN loss within a spindle cell neoplasm, as revealed by genomic profiling based on NGS.

Mechanistically, direct upregulation of the growth hormone IGF2 emerged as a mediator of the aggressive properties regulated by GATA2. IGF2 in turn activated IGF1R and INSR as well as a downstream polykinase program.

1776,Adaptive Scaling of Reward in Episodic Memory: A Replication Study.,"Reward is thought to enhance episodic memory formation via dopaminergic consolidation. Bunzeck, Dayan, Dolan, and Duzel (2010) provided fMRI and behavioural evidence that reward and episodic memory systems are sensitive to the contextual value of a reward-whether it is relatively higher or lower-as opposed to absolute value or prediction error. We carried out a direct replication of their behavioural study and did not replicate their finding that memory performance associated with reward follows this pattern of adaptive scaling. An effect of reward outcome was in the opposite direction to the original study, with lower reward outcomes leading to better memory than higher outcomes. There was a marginal effect of reward context, suggesting that expected value affected memory performance. We discuss the robustness of the reward memory relationship to variations in reward context, and whether other reward-related factors have a more reliable influence on episodic memory.

1008,Selective inhibition of BET bromodomains.,"Epigenetic proteins are intently pursued targets in ligand discovery. So far, successful efforts have been limited to chromatin modifying enzymes, or so-called epigenetic 'writers' and 'erasers'. Potent inhibitors of histone binding modules have not yet been described. Here we report a cell-permeable small molecule (JQ1) that binds competitively to acetyl-lysine recognition motifs, or bromodomains. High potency and specificity towards a subset of human bromodomains is explained by co-crystal structures with bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) family member BRD4, revealing excellent shape complementarity with the acetyl-lysine binding cavity. Recurrent translocation of BRD4 is observed in a genetically-defined, incurable subtype of human squamous carcinoma. Competitive binding by JQ1 displaces the BRD4 fusion oncoprotein from chromatin, prompting squamous differentiation and specific antiproliferative effects in BRD4-dependent cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models. These data establish proof-of-concept for targeting protein-protein interactions of epigenetic 'readers', and provide a versatile chemical scaffold for the development of chemical probes more broadly throughout the bromodomain family.",cancer

The purpose of the present study was to perform the first clinical investigation of the association between the DNA topoisomerase I gene (TOP1) copy number and objective response following irinotecan treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from 78 patients, who received irinotecan monotherapy in second line, were included. TOP1 was assessed by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a technically validated dual-probe combination that hybridizes to TOP1, located at 20q12-q13.1, and to the centromere region of chromosome 20 (CEN-20). In univariate logistic regression models, the TOP1 signal count per cell and the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio were associated with objective response, which was evaluated according to RECIST v.1.1. Gain of TOP1 was identified in 52.6% and 37.2% using the following cutoff values: TOP1 signal count per cell ≥3.6 and TOP1/CEN-20 ≥1.5, respectively. A borderline significant association (Odds ratio (OR): 1.62; p = 0.07) between a stepwise increase in the TOP1 signal count and objective response was demonstrated. In relation to the applied cutoff values, nonsignificant associations with objective response were identified for the TOP1 signal count (OR: 2.41; p = 0.23) and for the TOP1/CEN-20 ratio (OR: 2.05; p = 0.30).

It appeared that ras gene mutations can be found in a variety of tumor types, although the incidence varies greatly. The highest incidences are found in adenocarcinomas of the pancreas (90%), the colon (50%), and the lung (30%); in thyroid tumors (50%); and in myeloid leukemia (30%). For some tumor types a relationship may exist between the presence of a ras mutation and clinical or histopathological features of the tumor.

237,Biomarkers for the clinical management of breast cancer: international perspective.,"The higher incidence of breast cancer in developed countries has been tempered by reductions in mortality, largely attributable to mammographic screening programmes and advances in adjuvant therapy. Optimal systemic management requires consideration of clinical, pathological and biological parameters. Oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα), progesterone receptor (PgR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) are established biomarkers evaluated at diagnosis, which identify cardinal subtypes of breast cancer. Their prognostic and predictive utility effectively guides systemic treatment with endocrine, anti-HER2 and chemotherapy. Hence, accurate and reliable determination remains of paramount importance. However, the goals of personalized medicine and targeted therapies demand further information regarding residual risk and potential benefit of additional treatments in specific circumstances. The need for biomarkers which are fit for purpose, and the demands placed upon them, is therefore expected to increase. Technological advances, in particular high-throughput global gene expression profiling, have generated multi-gene signatures providing further prognostic and predictive information. The rational integration of routinely evaluated clinico-pathological parameters with key indicators of biological activity, such as proliferation markers, also provides a ready opportunity to improve the information available to guide systemic therapy decisions. The additional value of such information and its proper place in patient management is currently under evaluation in prospective clinical trials. Expanding the utility of biomarkers to lower resource settings requires an emphasis on cost effectiveness, quality assurance and possible international variations in tumor biology; the potential for improved clinical outcomes should be justified against logistical and economic considerations.",cancer

FACT and MYCN expression created a forward feedback loop in neuroblastoma cells that was essential for maintaining mutual high expression. FACT inhibition by the small-molecule curaxin compound CBL0137 markedly reduced tumor initiation and progression in vivo. CBL0137 exhibited strong synergy with standard chemotherapy by blocking repair of DNA damage caused by genotoxic drugs, thus creating a synthetic lethal environment in MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cells and suggesting a treatment strategy for MYCN-driven neuroblastoma.",cancer
1865,Understanding and modeling Retention of Mammalian Cells in Fluidized Bed Centrifuges.,"Within the last decade, fully-disposable centrifuge technologies, Fluidized-Bed Centrifuges (FBC), have been introduced to the biologics industry. The FBC has found a niche in cell therapy where it is used to collect, concentrate, and then wash mammalian cell product while continuously discarding centrate. The goal of this research was to determine optimum FBC conditions for recovery of live cells, and to develop a mathematical model that can assist with process scaleup. Cell losses can occur during bed formation via flow channels within the bed. Experimental results with the kSep400 centrifuge indicate that, for a given volume processed: the bed height (a bed compactness indicator) is affected by RPM and flowrate, and dead cells are selectively removed during operation. To explain these results, two modelling approaches were employed: (1) equating the centrifugal and inertial forces on the cells (i.e. a Force balance model or FBM model) and (2) a two-phase computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict liquid flow patterns and cell retention in the bowl. Both models predicted bed height versus time reasonably well, though the CFD model proved more accurate. The flow patterns predicted by CFD indicate a Coriolis-driven flow that enhances uniformity of cells in the bed and may lead to cell losses in the outflow over time. The CFD-predicted loss of viable cells and selective removal of the dead cells generally agreed with experimental trends, but did over-predict dead cell loss by up to 3 fold for some of the conditions.

685,Impact of the specific mutation in KRAS codon 12 mutated tumors on treatment efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab-based first-line therapy: a pooled analysis of three trials.,"This study investigated the impact of specific mutations in codon 12 of the Kirsten-ras (KRAS) gene on treatment efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). Overall, 119 patients bearing a KRAS mutation in codon 12 were evaluated. All patients received cetuximab-based first-line chemotherapy within the Central European Cooperative Oncology Group (CECOG), AIO KRK-0104 or AIO KRK-0306 trials. Patients with KRAS codon 12 mutant mCRC showed a broad range of outcome when treated with cetuximab-based first-line regimens. Patients with tumors bearing a KRAS p.G12D mutation showed a strong trend to a more favorable outcome compared to other mutations (overall survival 23.3 vs. 14-18 months; hazard ratio 0.66, range 0.43-1.03). An interaction model illustrated that KRAS p.G12C was associated with unfavorable outcome when treated with oxaliplatin plus cetuximab. The present analysis suggests that KRAS codon 12 mutation may not represent a homogeneous entity in mCRC when treated with cetuximab-based first-line therapy.",cancer
2000,New structures of bilayer germanium nanosheets predicted by a particle swarm optimization method.,"A global search for the stable structures of bilayer Ge (BLG) is performed, and the most stable and meta-stable BLG structures are predicted for the first time. Phonon-spectrum calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations confirm their dynamical and thermal stability. The computed electronic structures suggest that the most stable structure is metal while the meta-stable structure of BLG is a semiconductor with an indirect band gap (0.32 eV at the level of PBE functional and 0.81 eV at the level of HSE06). By straining the layer plane of the meta-stable BLG, we observe a phase transition from semiconductor to metal. Furthermore, the adsorption of gas molecules of CO, CO2, NH3, NO and NO2 on the meta-stable structure is also studied. Our results show that the predicted meta-stable BLG also possesses a good feature in gas sensors.",nonCancer
324,Prognostic impact of programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) and PD-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in cancer cells and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in ovarian high grade serous carcinoma.,"Antibodies targeting the checkpoint molecules programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and its ligand PD-L1 are emerging cancer therapeutics. We systematically investigated PD-1 and PD-L1 expression patterns in the poor-prognosis tumor entity high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma. PD-1 and PD-L1 protein expression was determined by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays from 215 primary cancers both in cancer cells and in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). mRNA expression was measured by quantitative reverse transcription PCR. An in silico validation of mRNA data was performed in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. PD-1 and PD-L1 expression in cancer cells, CD3+, PD-1+, and PD-L1+ TILs densities as well as PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA levels were positive prognostic factors for progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), with all factors being significant for PFS (p < 0.035 each), and most being significant for OS. Most factors also had prognostic value that was independent from age, stage, and residual tumor. Moreover, high PD-1+ TILs as well as PD-L1+ TILs densities added prognostic value to CD3+TILs (PD-1+: p = 0.002,; PD-L1+: p = 0.002). The significant positive prognostic impact of PD-1 and PD-L1 mRNA expression could be reproduced in the TCGA gene expression datasets (p = 0.02 and p < 0.0001, respectively). Despite their reported immune-modulatory function, high PD-1 and PD-L1 levels are indicators of a favorable prognosis in ovarian cancer. Our data indicate that PD-1 and PD-L1 molecules are biologically relevant regulators of the immune response in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma, which is an argument for the evaluation of immune checkpoint inhibiting drugs in this tumor entity.",cancer
892,Pharmacologic inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 arrests the growth of glioblastoma multiforme intracranial xenografts.,"Activation of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (cdk4/6) occurs in the majority of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tumors, and represents a promising molecular target for the development of small molecule inhibitors. In the current study, we investigated the molecular determinants and in vivo response of diverse GBM cell lines and xenografts to PD-0332991, a cdk4/6-specific inhibitor. In vitro testing of PD-0332991 against a panel of GBM cell lines revealed a potent G(1) cell cycle arrest and induction of senescence in each of 16 retinoblastoma protein (Rb)-proficient cell lines regardless of other genetic lesions, whereas 5 cell lines with homozygous inactivation of Rb were completely resistant to treatment. Short hairpin RNA depletion of Rb expression conferred resistance of GBM cells to PD-0332991, further demonstrating a requirement of Rb for sensitivity to cdk4/6 inhibition. PD-0332991 was found to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier and proved highly effective in suppressing the growth of intracranial GBM xenograft tumors, including those that had recurred after initial therapy with temozolomide. Remarkably, no mice receiving PD-0332991 died as a result of disease progression while on therapy. Additionally, the combination of PD-0332991 and radiation therapy resulted in significantly increased survival benefit compared with either therapy alone. In total, our results support clinical trial evaluation of PD-0332991 against newly diagnosed as well as recurrent GBM, and indicate that Rb status is the primary determinant of potential benefit from this therapy.",cancer
1868,Low Prevalence of Conjunctival Infection with Chlamydia trachomatis in a Treatment-Naïve Trachoma-Endemic Region of the Solomon Islands.,"Trachoma is endemic in several Pacific Island states. Recent surveys across the Solomon Islands indicated that whilst trachomatous inflammation-follicular (TF) was present at levels warranting intervention, the prevalence of trachomatous trichiasis (TT) was low. We set out to determine the relationship between chlamydial infection and trachoma in this population.|We conducted a population-based trachoma prevalence survey of 3674 individuals from two Solomon Islands provinces. Participants were examined for clinical signs of trachoma. Conjunctival swabs were collected from all children aged 1-9 years. We tested swabs for Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) DNA using droplet digital PCR. Chlamydial DNA from positive swabs was enriched and sequenced for use in phylogenetic analysis.|We observed a moderate prevalence of TF in children aged 1-9 years (n = 296/1135, 26.1%) but low prevalence of trachomatous inflammation-intense (TI) (n = 2/1135, 0.2%) and current Ct infection (n = 13/1002, 1.3%) in children aged 1-9 years, and TT in those aged 15+ years (n = 2/2061, 0.1%). Ten of 13 (76.9%) cases of infection were in persons with TF or TI (p = 0.0005). Sequence analysis of the Ct-positive samples yielded 5/13 (38%) complete (>95% coverage of reference) genome sequences, and 8/13 complete plasmid sequences. Complete sequences all aligned most closely to ocular serovar reference strains.|The low prevalence of TT, TI and Ct infection that we observed are incongruent with the high proportion of children exhibiting signs of TF. TF is present at levels that apparently warrant intervention, but the scarcity of other signs of trachoma indicates the phenotype is mild and may not pose a significant public health threat. Our data suggest that, whilst conjunctival Ct infection appears to be present in the region, it is present at levels that are unlikely to be the dominant driving force for TF in the population. This could be one reason for the low prevalence of TT observed during the study.",nonCancer
1128,Activation of N-ras and K-ras induced by interleukin-6 in a myeloma cell line: implications for disease progression and therapeutic response.,"Ras is a major signaling molecule activated by interleukin-6. There have been no published reports, however, that specifically examine the kinetics and percentage of Ras activation in response to IL-6. Model cell lines were used to study activation of N- and K-ras induced by IL-6. All of the myeloma cell lines we tested express both N-ras and K-ras, but not H-ras. GTP-bound Ras was measured and the percentage of the total Ras pool that was activated in response to IL-6 was calculated. IL-6 is able to transiently activate both N- and K-ras in the ANBL6 cell line. In addition, increasing concentrations of IL-6 are able to activate increasing levels of both N- and K-ras. One ng/ml of IL-6 is able to activate approximately 10% of the N-ras pool and 18% of the K-ras pool. The amount of Ras-GTP in the cells correlates with the level of proliferation at low levels, but proliferation plateaus when higher levels of Ras-GTP are present. Protection from dexamethasone-induced apoptosis correlates with IL-6 concentration and Ras activation. However, IL-6 enhances apoptosis induced by doxorubicin. Interestingly, the ANBL6 cell line transfected with an N-ras12 or a K-ras12 gene is protected from doxorubicin-induced apoptosis.",cancer
945,Comprehensive mutation profiling of mucinous gastric carcinoma.,"Mucinous gastric carcinoma (MGC) is a unique subtype of gastric cancer with a poor survival outcome. Comprehensive molecular profiles and putative therapeutic targets of MGC remain undetermined. We subjected 16 tumour-normal tissue pairs to whole-exome sequencing (WES) and an expanded set of 52 tumour-normal tissue pairs to subsequent targeted sequencing. The latter focused on 114 genes identified by WES. Twenty-two histologically differentiated MGCs (D-MGCs) and 46 undifferentiated MGCs (U-MGCs) were analysed. Chromatin modifier genes, including ARID1A (21%), MLL2 (19%), MLL3 (15%), and KDM6A (7%), were frequently mutated (47%) in MGC. We also identified mutations in potential therapeutic target genes, including MTOR (9%), BRCA2 (9%), BRCA1 (7%), and ERBB3 (6%). RHOA mutation was detected only in 4% of U-MGCs and in no D-MGCs. MYH9 was recurrently (13%) mutated in MGC, with all these being of the U-MGC subtype (p = 0.023). Three U-MGCs harboured MYH9 nonsense mutations. MYH9 knockdown enhanced cell migration and induced intracytoplasmic mucin and cellular elongation. BCOR mutation was associated with improved survival. In U-MGCs, the MLH1 expression status and combined mutation status (TP53/BCL11B or TP53/MLL2) were prognostic factors. A comparative analysis of driver genes revealed that the mutation profile of D-MGC was similar to that of intestinal-type gastric cancer, whereas U-MGC was a distinct entity, harbouring a different mutational profile to intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancers.

1162,BRAF(V600E) mutation and outcome of patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma: a 15-year median follow-up study.,"The BRAF(V600E) mutation is the most frequent genetic alteration in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). The role of BRAF(V600E) mutation as a poor prognostic factor has been controversially reported in series with short-term follow-ups. In this study we verified the prognostic value of the BRAF(V600E) mutation in PTC patients with a long-term follow-up. We studied 102 PTC patients with a median follow-up of 15 yr. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was analyzed by PCR-single-strand conformational polymorphism and sequencing. The correlation between the presence/absence of the BRAF(V600E) mutation, clinicopathological features, and outcome of PTC patients were evaluated. The BRAF(V600E) mutation was found in 38 of 102 (37.3%) PTC patients, and was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 yr (P = 0.02), in advanced stages (P = 0.03), and in cases with vascular invasion (P = 0.02). At univariate analysis the worst outcome for PTC patients was significantly correlated with clinicopathological features (i.e. age, tumor size, extrathyroid extension, lymph node and distant metastases, advanced stage, vascular endothelial growth factor expression, and vascular invasion) and the BRAF(V600E) mutation (P < 0.002). However, at multivariate analysis only the BRAF(V600E) mutation showed an independent correlation with the worst outcome (P = 0.03). Moreover, the survival curves of PTC patients showed a lower percentage of survivors in the BRAF(V600E)-mutated group (P = 0.015). In this study the BRAF(V600E) mutation correlated with the worst outcome for PTC patients, who were not only at a higher risk not to be cured but also for death. In particular, the BRAF(V600E) mutation was demonstrated to be a poor prognostic factor independent from other clinicopathological features.",cancer
2230,In vivo (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 PET imaging of 18kDa translocator protein in recent onset psychosis.,"Evidence is accumulating that immune dysfunction is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. It has been hypothesized that microglia activation is present in patients with schizophrenia. Various in vivo and post-mortem studies have investigated this hypothesis, but as yet with inconclusive results. Microglia activation is associated with elevations in 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) levels, which can be measured with the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer (R)-[(11)C]PK11195. The purpose of the present study was to investigate microglia activation in psychosis in vivo at an early stage of the disease. (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 binding potential (BPND) was measured in 19 patients with recent onset psychosis and 17 age and gender-matched healthy controls. Total gray matter, as well as five gray matter regions of interest (frontal cortex, temporal cortex, parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus) were defined a priori. PET data were analysed using a reference tissue approach and a supervised cluster analysis algorithm to identify the reference region. No significant difference in (R)-[(11)C]PK11195 BPND between patients and controls was found in total gray matter, nor one of the regions of interest. These findings suggest that microglia activation is not present in recent onset psychosis or that it is a subtle phenomenon that could not be detected using the design of the present study.",nonCancer
920,Diagnostic and prognostic TERT promoter mutations in thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy.,"Two promoter mutations, chr5:1 295 228C>T and chr5:1 295 250C>T, in the gene for telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) have been recently identified in thyroid cancers and shown to be important in thyroid tumor pathogenesis. The diagnostic and prognostic potentials of testing for these mutations on thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) have not been investigated. Herein, we examined the two TERT promoter mutations along with the BRAF V600E mutation by direct DNA sequencing on 308 FNAB specimens preoperatively obtained from thyroid nodules with postoperatively confirmed pathological diagnoses. We found TERT promoter mutations in 0.0% (0/179) of benign thyroid nodules and 7.0% (9/129) of thyroid nodules of differentiated thyroid cancer, representing a 100% diagnostic specificity and 7.0% sensitivity, with the latter rising to 38.0% (49/129) when combined with BRAF V600E testing. Several TERT-promoter-mutation-positive thyroid nodules were cytologically indeterminate on FNAB. Approximately 80% of the TERT promoter mutation-positive thyroid nodules were thyroid cancers with aggressive clinicopathological behaviors, such as extrathyroidal invasion, lymph node metastases, distant metastases, disease recurrence or patient death. Thus, a positive TERT promoter mutation test not only definitively diagnoses a thyroid nodule as cancerous but also preoperatively identifies a cancer with aggressive potential. This is the first study, to our knowledge, of TERT promoter mutations on thyroid FNAB, demonstrating the value of this novel molecular testing in the diagnosis of thyroid nodules and preoperative risk stratification of thyroid cancer. Thus, testing of TERT promoter mutations on FNAB will enhance and improve the current molecular-based approaches to the management of thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer.",cancer
1456,High prevalence of constipation and reduced quality of life in opioid-dependent patients treated with opioid substitution treatments.,"To evaluate prevalence and severity of constipation and quality of life (QoL) in a cohort of opioid-addicted patients treated with opioid substitution treatments.|Multicenter observational study. A total of 1057 heroin-dependent patients treated with methadone or buprenorphine were enrolled. Constipation was assessed by Wexner Constipation Scoring System, QoL by General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12).|38.5% patients reported mild constipation, 33.3% reported moderate constipation, 14.8% severe constipation and 5.1% very severe constipation. Mean Wexner CSS score was 6.6 ± 4.8. 44.9% patients showed a GHQ-12 score ≥14; of these 18.3% patients showed a GHQ-12 score ≥20. Mean GHQ score was 13.8 ± 6.5. Mean Wexner CSS score was significantly higher in methadone patients (p=0.004), in those taking psychoactive drugs (p=0.0001) and in female (p<0.0001) with respect to counterparts. Similarly, GHQ-12 mean scores were higher methadone group (p=0.003), in those taking psychoactive drugs (p<0.0001), and in female (p=0.039) with respect to counterparts. ANOVA and ANCOVA showed a significant influence of methadone and female gender on Wexner CSS score while psychoactive drugs significantly influenced both tests.|The present study shows that patients affected by opioid-dependence in OST with methadone and buprenorphine have a high prevalence of constipation and reduced QoL.",nonCancer
897,"PIK3CA mutation, but not PTEN loss of function, determines the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to mTOR inhibitory drugs.","The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway is commonly activated in breast cancers due to frequent mutations in PIK3CA, loss of expression of PTEN or over-expression of receptor tyrosine kinases. PI3K pathway activation leads to stimulation of the key growth and proliferation regulatory kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which can be inhibited by rapamycin analogues and by kinase inhibitors; the effectiveness of these drugs in breast cancer treatment is currently being tested in clinical trials. To identify the molecular determinants of response to inhibitors that target mTOR via different mechanisms in breast cancer cells, we investigated the effects of pharmacological inhibition of mTOR using the allosteric mTORC1 inhibitor everolimus and the active-site mTORC1/mTORC2 kinase inhibitor PP242 on a panel of 31 breast cancer cell lines. We demonstrate here that breast cancer cells harbouring PIK3CA mutations are selectively sensitive to mTOR allosteric and kinase inhibitors. However, cells with PTEN loss of function are not sensitive to these drugs, suggesting that the functional consequences of these two mechanisms of activation of the mTOR pathway are quite distinct. In addition, a subset of HER2-amplified cell lines showed increased sensitivity to PP242, but not to everolimus, irrespective of the PIK3CA/PTEN status. These selective sensitivities were confirmed in more physiologically relevant three-dimensional cell culture models. Our findings provide a rationale to guide selection of breast cancer patients who may benefit from mTOR inhibitor therapy and highlight the importance of accurately assessing the expression of PTEN protein and not just its mutational status.",cancer
1033,Clinical implications of T790M mutation in patients with acquired resistance to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.,"Although T790M mutation is considered to be the major mechanism of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), its clinical implication remains undetermined. Post-progression tumor specimens were prospectively collected for T790M mutation analysis in NSCLC patients with acquired resistance to initial EGFR TKIs. Clinical features were compared between patients with and without T790M. Out of 70 cases, 36 (51%) were identified to have T790M mutation in the rebiopsy specimen. There was no difference in the pattern of disease progression, progression-free survival for initial TKIs (12.8 and 11.3 months), post-progression survival (14.7 and 14.1 months), or overall survival (43.5 and 36.8 months) in patients with and without T790M. In total, 34 patients received afatinib after post-progression biopsy as a subsequent treatment, and the response rate was 18%. The median progression-free survival for afatinib was 3.7 months for the entire group, and 3.2 and 4.6 months for the groups with and without T790M, respectively (P = 0.33). The identification of T790M as acquired resistance mechanism was clinically feasible. Although T790M had no prognostic or predictive role in the present study, further research is necessary to identify patients with T790M-mutant tumors who might benefit from newly developed T790M-specific TKIs.",cancer
768,I1171 missense mutation (particularly I1171N) is a common resistance mutation in ALK-positive NSCLC patients who have progressive disease while on alectinib and is sensitive to ceritinib.,"Acquired resistance mutations to anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors such as crizotinib and alectinib have been documented in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring ALK rearrangement (ALK+). Of note I1171T/N/S mutations in the ALK kinase domain have recently been described by several groups to confer resistance to alectinib, a second-generation ALK inhibitor. Additionally one of these reports demonstrated one ALK+ NSCLC patient harboring an I1171T acquired mutation has responded to ceritinib, another second-generation ALK inhibitor. We reported the presence of an ALK I1171N resistance mutation from comprehensive genomic profiling from a liver biopsy of a progressing metastatic lesion in an ALK+ patient on alectinib after an initial partial response. The patient then responded to ceritinib 750 mg orally once daily but required dose reduction to 600 mg once daily. She initially had grade 3 elevation of liver enzymes from crizotinib necessitating the original switch to alectinib but experienced no transaminase elevations with alectinib or ceritinib. This is the fifth patient case to date demonstrating that ALK I1171 mutation confers resistance to alectinib and the second reported case of ALK I1171 mutation being sensitivity to ceritinib. Substitutions of isoleucine at amino acid 1171 in the ALK kinase domain may distinguish which second generation ALK inhibitor will be effective after crizotinib failure. This case also provides evidence that transaminase elevations is likely a unique adverse event associated with crizotinib and unlikely a ""class"" effect involving all ALK inhibitors.",cancer
2370,Health-related quality of life in outpatients with primary central nervous system lymphoma after radiotherapy and high-dose methotrexate chemotherapy.,"Chemoradiotherapy for primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) is associated with a considerable risk of long-term neurotoxicity. The present study aimed to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) of outpatients with PCNSL who have received radiotherapy and high-dose methotrexate (HDMTX) chemotherapy, and to determine the factors that cause a decline in HRQOL and interfere with home living. A total of 37 patients were surveyed 0.9-14.2 years after their initial diagnosis and treatment. Each patient completed a multi-part HRQOL questionnaire that was used to examine the associations of HRQOL scores with leukoencephalopathy, Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores, age, history of recurrence and HDMTX-based chemoradiotherapy. The results demonstrated that the history of recurrence, number of cycles of MTX chemotherapy and age affected the development of leukoencephalopathy. Reductions in KPS score were associated with a history of recurrence (P=0.03), but not with leukoencephalopathy (P=0.8). KPS score, leukoencephalopathy and age were significantly associated with a decline in HRQOL score. A decline in the HRQOL associated with a reduction in KPS score was also observed by multivariate analyses. Deterioration of the HRQOL among outpatients with PCNSL post-chemoradiotherapy was significantly associated with older age (≥66 years) and decreased KPS score. Older patients with a history of recurrence had a higher risk for deteriorated QOL due to development of leukoencephalopathy. Therefore, it is recommended that clinicians monitor the KPS score among outpatients with PCNSL. QOL examination for older patients with a lower KPS score was found to be particularly important for identifying any obstacles for home living.",nonCancer
1706,Making Early Modern Medicine: Reproducing Swedish Bitters.,"Historians of science and medicine have rarely applied themselves to reproducing the experiments and practices of medicine and pharmacy. This paper delineates our efforts to reproduce ""Swedish Bitters,"" an early modern composite medicine in wide European use from the 1730s to the present. In its original formulation, it was made from seven medicinal simples: aloe, rhubarb, saffron, myrrh, gentian, zedoary and agarikon. These were mixed in alcohol together with some theriac, a composite medicine of classical origin. The paper delineates the compositional history of Swedish Bitters and the medical rationale underlying its composition. It also describes how we go about to reproduce the medicine in a laboratory using early modern pharmaceutical methods, and analyse it using contemporary methods of pharmaceutical chemistry. Our aim is twofold: first, to show how reproducing medicines may provide a path towards a deeper understanding of the role of sensual and practical knowledge in the wider context of early modern medical culture; and second, how it may yield interesting results from the point of view of contemporary pharmaceutical science.",nonCancer
463,EGFR exon-level biomarkers of the response to bevacizumab/erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations are recognized biomarkers for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). EGFR TKIs can also have activity against NSCLC without EGFR mutations, requiring the identification of additional relevant biomarkers. Previous studies on tumor EGFR protein levels and EGFR gene copy number revealed inconsistent results. The aim of the study was to identify novel biomarkers of the response to TKIs in NSCLC by investigating whole genome expression at the exon-level. We used exon arrays and clinical samples from a previous trial (SAKK19/05) to investigate the expression variations at the exon-level of 3 genes potentially playing a key role in modulating treatment response: EGFR, V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGFA). We identified the expression of EGFR exon 18 as a new predictive marker for patients with untreated metastatic NSCLC treated with bevacizumab and erlotinib in the first line setting. The overexpression of EGFR exon 18 in tumor was significantly associated with tumor shrinkage, independently of EGFR mutation status. A similar significant association could be found in blood samples. In conclusion, exonic EGFR expression particularly in exon 18 was found to be a relevant predictive biomarker for response to bevacizumab and erlotinib. Based on these results, we propose a new model of EGFR testing in tumor and blood.",cancer

Relevant articles on MDO were assessed and selected in 3 rounds for final review based on 5 predefined inclusion criteria and followed by a round of critical appraisal. Different types of distraction and their treatment outcomes of OSAS were recorded with standardized form and analyzed.|Twelve articles were included in the final review. A total of 256 patients aged 7 days to 60 years were treated with either external or internal MDO, with a mean follow-up period of 6 to 37 months. The average distraction distance of 12 to 29 mm was achieved with various distraction protocols. The success rate for adult patients was 100%, and cure rates were ranged from 82% to 100%. The definition of success or cure for OSAS in children or infants was not defined. Therefore, there were no clearly reported success or cure rates for children/infants in the included studies. However, all studies reported that these patients showed significant improvement in OSAS, with many of them who avoided tracheostomy or had the tracheostomy decannulated. The complication rates were ranged from 0% to 21.4%, with most being from local wound infections or neurosensory disturbances.|This systematic review showed that MDO was effective in resolving OSAS in adults with retrognathic mandible. MDO also showed promising results in infants or children with OSAS. From the results of this systematic review, we recommend to define the criteria of success or cure for OSAS surgery in children and infants. We also recommend setting up randomized controlled trials to compare MDO with traditional maxillomandibular advancement surgery for OSAS patients and to provide a better evidence on the success and complication rates of the techniques.",nonCancer
676,Clinical benefit of continuing ALK inhibition with crizotinib beyond initial disease progression in patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.,"Crizotinib is approved to treat advanced ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but most patients ultimately develop progressive disease (PD). We investigated whether continuing ALK inhibition with crizotinib beyond PD (CBPD) is clinically beneficial and attempted to identify clinicopathologic characteristics associated with patients who experience clinical benefit. Patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC enrolled in two ongoing multicenter, single-arm trials who developed RECIST-defined PD were allowed to continue crizotinib if they were deriving ongoing clinical benefit. In the present retrospective analysis, continuation of CBPD was defined as >3 weeks of crizotinib treatment after PD documentation. Patients who had PD as best response to initial crizotinib treatment were excluded. Baseline and post-progression characteristics, sites of PD, and overall survival (OS) were compared in patients who continued CBPD versus those who did not. The impact of continuing CBPD on OS after adjusting for potential confounding factors was assessed. Among 194 crizotinib-treated patients with RECIST-defined PD, 120 (62%) continued CBPD. A significantly higher proportion of patients who continued CBPD than patients who did not had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0/1 at PD (96% versus 82%; P=0.02). CBPD patients had significantly longer OS from the time of PD [median 16.4 versus 3.9 months; hazards ratio (HR) 0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.17-0.42; P<0.0001] and from the time of initial crizotinib treatment (median 29.6 versus 10.8 months; HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.19-0.46; P<0.0001). The multiple-covariate Cox regression analysis revealed that CBPD remained significantly associated with improved OS after adjusting for relevant factors. Patients who continued CBPD were more likely to have good ECOG PS (0/1) at the time of PD. Continuing ALK inhibition with crizotinib after PD may provide survival benefit to patients with advanced ALK-positive NSCLC.",cancer
627,A novel BRCA1 mutation in a patient with breast and ovarian cancer: A case report.,"Germline mutations in the human breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for a substantial proportion of familial, early-onset breast and ovarian cancers. The present study reports a novel disease-causing BRCA1 mutation, nucleotide 3020insCT/c.2901insCT, in a 55-year-old Spanish female with breast and ovarian cancer. This frameshift mutation creates a premature stop codon at amino acid 1000, leading to a truncated BRCA1 protein. To the best of our knowledge, this mutation has not been previously described in the Breast Cancer Information Core (BIC) database or the published literature.",cancer
1018,Mutations of the VHL gene in sporadic renal cell carcinoma: definition of a risk factor for VHL patients to develop an RCC.,"To investigate the nature of somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations, we analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas for mutations of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) of DNA. We detected abnormal SSCP pattern in 73 samples. After sequencing, we identified microdeletions in 58% of cases, microinsertions in 17%, nonsense mutations in 8%, and missense mutations in 17%. Among these mutations, 50% correspond to new mutations. VHL mutations were found only in the nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype, as previously reported. To compare somatic and germline mutations, we used the VHL database, which includes 507 mutations. The study of mutational events revealed a significant difference between somatic and germline mutations with mutations leading to truncated proteins observed in 78% of somatic mutations vs only 37% in germline mutations (P < 0.001). We postulated that a specific pattern of VHL mutations is associated with sporadic RCC. This pattern corresponds to mutations leading mainly to truncated proteins with few specific missense mutations. We then analyzed the occurrence of RCC in VHL families, based on the nature of mutations. We observed RCC in at least one member of the VHL families in 77% of cases with mutations leading to truncated proteins versus 55% in cases with missense mutations (P < 0.05). Thus, mutations resulting in truncated proteins may lead to a higher risk of RCC in VHL patients.",cancer
1657,Effects of depression and antidepressant medications on hip fracture: A population-based cohort study in Taiwan.,"This study was conducted to investigate the effects of depression and antidepressant medications on hip fracture. The database of the Taiwan National Health Insurance with medical records of more than 1,000,000 individuals was searched for patients who had hip fracture with or without depression from 1998 to 2009. Patients with the following conditions were excluded: hip fracture due to cancer or traffic accidents, hip fracture that occurred before the diagnosis of depression, and use of antidepressants before the diagnosis of depression. A matched cohort of 139,110 patients was investigated, including 27,822 (17,309 females; 10,513 males) with depression and 111,288 (69,236 females; 42,052 males) without depression (1:4 randomly matched with age, sex, and index date). Among these patients, 232 (158 females and 74 males) had both hip fracture and depression, and 690 (473 females and 217 males) had hip fracture only. The Cox proportional-hazards regression method was used to determine the effect of depression on hip fracture. The hazard ratio (HR) for each clinical parameter was calculated after adjusting for confounders including sex, age, Charlson comorbidity index, urbanization, osteoporosis, and antidepressants. Results showed that patients with major depressive disorder had a 61% higher incidence of hip fracture than those without depression (HR 1.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-2.18, P = 0.002). The risk of hip fracture for patients with less severe depressive disorder (dysthymia or depressive disorder, not otherwise specified) was not statistically higher than that of patients with no depression (HR 1.10, 95% CI = 0.91-1.34, P = 0.327). Among the patients with depression, females had a 49% higher incidence for hip fracture than males (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.30-1.72, P < 0.001). The incidence of hip fracture also increased with age and Charlson comorbidity index scores. Analyses of both all (139,110) patients and only patients (27,822) with depression revealed that antidepressants had no negative impact on the incidence of hip fracture. In conclusion, major depression was found to be a risk factor for hip fracture and that use of antidepressants had no adverse effect on hip fracture in the Taiwanese population.",nonCancer
1802,Graphane Nanostripes.,"Graphane, the hydrogenated counterpart of graphene, was shown to exhibit properties such as tunable band gaps through varied degrees of hydrogenation, fluorescence, or ferromagnetism. Graphane nanostripe properties have also been theoretically predicted. Herein, we show that graphane nanostripes can be prepared by opening carbon nanotubes using Birch reduction in liquid ammonia utilizing potassium as a reducing agent and water as a proton donor. The prepared graphane nanostripes exhibit several exceptional properties when coupled with trace metal dopants. The interplay of metallic nanoparticles and defects lead to a spin polarization and induction of ferromagnetic moment, as well as to enhanced electrocatalytic properties in the hydrogen evolution reaction when compared to non-hydrogenated carbon nanotubes.",nonCancer
2169,Heparins that block VEGF-A-mediated von Willebrand factor fiber generation are potent inhibitors of hematogenous but not lymphatic metastasis.,"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) serves as a nidus for platelet aggregation and thrombosis. We hypothesize that VWF fibers contribute to the development of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and to metastasis formation. Here, we show that vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells (ECs) express VWF in vitro and release VWF fibers after activation by tumor cell supernatants. In contrast, an ex vivo analysis of primary mouse tumors revealed the presence of VWF fibers in the blood microvasculature but not in lymphatic vessels. Unlike the anticoagulant Fondaparinux, an inhibitor of thrombin generation, the low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) Tinzaparin inhibited VWF fiber formation and vessel occlusion in tumor vessels by blocking thrombin-induced EC activation and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A)-mediated VWF release. Intradermal tumor cell inoculation in VWF- and ADAMTS13-deficient mice did not alter lymph node metastases compared with wild type animals. Interestingly, multiple tumor-free distal organs exhibited hallmarks of malignancy-related VTE, including luminal VWF fibers, platelet-rich thrombi and vessel occlusions. Furthermore, ADAMTS13 deficiency, characterized by prolonged intraluminal VWF network lifetimes, resulted in a severely increased number of metastatic foci in an experimental model of hematogenous lung seeding. Treatment with Tinzaparin inhibited tumor-induced release of VWF multimers, impeded platelet aggregation and decreased lung metastasis. Thus, our data strongly suggest a critical role of luminal VWF fibers in determining the occurrence of thrombosis and cancer metastasis. Moreover, the findings highlight LMWHs as therapeutic strategy to treat thrombotic complications while executing anti-metastatic activities.",nonCancer

110,EML4-ALK mutations in lung cancer that confer resistance to ALK inhibitors.,"The EML4 (echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4)-ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) fusion-type tyrosine kinase is an oncoprotein found in 4 to 5% of non-small-cell lung cancers, and clinical trials of specific inhibitors of ALK for the treatment of such tumors are currently under way. Here, we report the discovery of two secondary mutations within the kinase domain of EML4-ALK in tumor cells isolated from a patient during the relapse phase of treatment with an ALK inhibitor. Each mutation developed independently in subclones of the tumor and conferred marked resistance to two different ALK inhibitors.

136,Effective use of PI3K and MEK inhibitors to treat mutant Kras G12D and PIK3CA H1047R murine lung cancers.,"Somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit (encoded by PIK3CA). They are most frequently observed in two hotspots: the helical domain (E545K and E542K) and the kinase domain (H1047R). Although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro, their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models. Furthermore, clinical trials with PI3K inhibitors have recently been initiated, and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific, genetically defined malignancies. In this study, we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha H1047R. Treatment of these tumors with NVP-BEZ235, a dual pan-PI3K and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor in clinical development, led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination. In contrast, mouse lung cancers driven by mutant Kras did not substantially respond to single-agent NVP-BEZ235. However, when NVP-BEZ235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor, ARRY-142886, there was marked synergy in shrinking these Kras-mutant cancers. These in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the PI3K-mTOR pathway may be active in cancers with PIK3CA mutations and, when combined with MEK inhibitors, may effectively treat KRAS mutated lung cancers.",cancer
1969,Direct site endovascular repair (DSER): A novel approach to vascular trauma.,"Peripheral vascular injuries carry significant risk for permanent functional impairment, limb loss, and death. Definitive correction of these injuries requires significant operative time and has traditionally been resource and skill set intensive. In the initial surgical treatment of the physiologically depleted trauma patient, faster techniques may prove more appropriate. Damage control techniques, including vascular shunting, rapidly restore distal flow, but require additional vascular intervention and risk shunt thrombosis with prolonged use. To address these challenges, we present a technique, using an off-the-shelf endovascular device, for treatment of peripheral arterial injuries. Direct Site Endovascular Repair (DSER) is an open vascular surgical reconstruction technique using conventional endovascular stent grafts to create a ""sutureless"" anastomosis. We believe this technique to be a valuable adjunct to current repair options.The values of this technique are that it is 1) rapid, 2) of low technical complexity, 3) requires very little equipment, and 4) may offer extended durability in damage control scenarios.We describe three patients where this technique was employed. In the first case the technique was employed to provide a temporary arterial shunt in a patient with a local infection and arterial disruption. The second case DSER was used for definitive repair of an injured artery after penetrating trauma. The third case involves DSER for definitive of both an artery and vein after penetrating trauma.",nonCancer
2250,Analysis of Epstein Barr Virus Encoded RNA Expression in Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma in North-Eastern India: A Chromogenic in Situ Hybridization Based Study.,"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common cancer in the North-East region of India. Though the role of environmental contributors of NPC in the North-Eastern part of India is firmly established, EBV as an etiological agent in the region remains unexplored.|Fifty-one patients, who presented at the department of ENT, NEIGRIHMS and were confirmed as NPC upon histopathological examination, were included in the study. Chromogenic in-situ hybridization (CISH) was used for the evaluation of EBER (Epstein Barr Virus Encoded RNA). Presence of nuclear signals was taken as positive for EBER expression. EBER status was correlated with various clinicopathological parameters like age, sex, dietary habits, histological types of NPC, and ethnicity of the patients.|The age range of the study group was 25 to 70 years with a mean age of 44.64 years and a male:female ratio of 3:2. Non-keratinizing undifferentiated type of NPC was the most common histological type. EBV was positive in 59% (30/51) of our cases. It showed a statistically significant correlation with the Naga community (P=0.01), with consumption of smoked food (P=0.02), and cigarette smoking (P=0.02). There was no correlation of EBV with age, sex, lymph node metastasis, stage, and histology.|Our result indicates that EBV may be an additional risk factor in the pathogenesis of NPC in this region of India. So apart from lifestyle modification, a future study for a screening test for EBV viral load even in asymptomatic patients may be considered, for determination of disease susceptibility, early diagnosis, and proper management.",nonCancer

The overall incidence rate was 19.7 cases per 10,000 person-years (p-yrs); annual incidence rates ranged from 16.5 to 22.2 cases per 10,000 p-yrs. Rates overall increased monotonically with increasing age and were higher among Air Force and Army members, officers, and healthcare workers than their respective counterparts. During the surveillance period, the 27,276 service members who had incident diagnoses of hiatal hernia accounted for 44,092 hiatal hernia-related encounters overall (1.6 encounters per case). Among all incident cases, 235 (0.86%) had surgical repairs documented during the period. The frequency of surgical treatment of hiatal hernias among military members mirrored the low frequency in U.S. civilian practice. During 2010-2014, most surgical procedures (79%) were accomplished via laparoscopic approaches. The incidence rates of hiatal hernia diagnoses reported here likely greatly underestimate the true incidence in U.S. military populations. Reasons for the underestimates and comparisons with other populations are discussed.",nonCancer
2107,The Anti-sigma Factor RsiV Is a Bacterial Receptor for Lysozyme: Co-crystal Structure Determination and Demonstration That Binding of Lysozyme to RsiV Is Required for σV Activation.,"σ factors provide RNA polymerase with promoter specificity in bacteria. Some σ factors require activation in order to interact with RNA polymerase and transcribe target genes. The Extra-Cytoplasmic Function (ECF) σ factor, σV, is encoded by several Gram-positive bacteria and is specifically activated by lysozyme. This activation requires the proteolytic destruction of the anti-σ factor RsiV via a process of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP). In many cases proteases that cleave at site-1 are thought to directly sense a signal and initiate the RIP process. We previously suggested binding of lysozyme to RsiV initiated the proteolytic destruction of RsiV and activation of σV. Here we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the RsiV-lysozyme complex at 2.3 Å which revealed that RsiV and lysozyme make extensive contacts. We constructed RsiV mutants with altered abilities to bind lysozyme. We find that mutants that are unable to bind lysozyme block site-1 cleavage of RsiV and σV activation in response to lysozyme. Taken together these data demonstrate that RsiV is a receptor for lysozyme and binding of RsiV to lysozyme is required for σV activation. In addition, the co-structure revealed that RsiV binds to the lysozyme active site pocket. We provide evidence that in addition to acting as a sensor for the presence of lysozyme, RsiV also inhibits lysozyme activity. Thus we have demonstrated that RsiV is a protein with multiple functions. RsiV inhibits σV activity in the absence of lysozyme, RsiV binds lysozyme triggering σV activation and RsiV inhibits the enzymatic activity of lysozyme.",nonCancer
1952,Eccentric rule of the radiocapitellar line from radiographs of normal elbows in young children.,"The radiocapitellar line (RCL) has long been used for the radiographic evaluation of elbow injuries in children. However, the utility of the RCL remains limited because the RCL does not always intersect the ossified capitellum centrically. To explore the eccentric rule of the RCL in young children, this study sought to evaluate how the RCL eccentric distance (ED) relative to the center point of the ossific capitellum changes with age. In 1022 children with normal elbows, aged between 1 and 10 years, the RCLs were drawn along the radial neck on the elbow anteroposterior (AP) and lateral radiographs by two orthopedic surgeons blinded to the study. When the RCL intersects the ossified capitellum, the widest perpendicular distance from the edge of the ossified capitellum to the RCL is measured on both sides of RCL. A formula has been designed to calculate the value of the ED relative to the center point of the ossified capitellum. Linear correlation analysis was carried out to assess the impacts of patient sex and age on the ED. Of the 1022 measured EDs, we found that there was an eccentrical rule of the RCL with average 0.17-0.31 cm lateral offsets on the AP view and average 0.10-0.23 cm posterior offsets on the lateral view, except for the group aged 3 years on the lateral view. The sex difference of ED was not statistically significant among any of the age groups (P>0.05), except for the group aged 3 years on the lateral view (P=0.009). Among children aged 3-8 years, the RCL in older children tended to slope more laterally (r=0.212, P<0.001) and less posteriorly (r=0.111, P=0.002) than those of younger children. Our study suggests an eccentrical rule of the RCL with the lateral offset on the AP view and the posterior offset on the lateral view in young children's normal elbows. Therefore, we recommend taking this into consideration in the evaluation of children's radiocapitellar injuries when using the RCL.|Level IV.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

2411,Tauroursodeoxycholic acid reduces the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells by modulating matrix metalloproteinases 7 and 13.,"Tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) is a conjugated form of UDCA that modulates several signaling pathways and acts as a chemical chaperone to relieve endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The present study showed that TUDCA reduced the invasion of the MDA-MB-231 metastatic breast cancer cell line under normoxic and hypoxic conditions using an in vitro invasion assay. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay revealed that the reduced invasion following TUDCA treatment was associated with a decreased expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-7 and -13, which play important roles in invasion and metastasis. Inhibitors and short hairpin RNAs were used to show that the effect of TUDCA in the reduction of invasion appeared to be dependent on the protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase pathway, a downstream ER stress signaling pathway. Thus, TUDCA is a candidate anti-metastatic agent to target the ER stress pathway.",nonCancer
2295,Moderate evidence for a Lombard effect in a phylogenetically basal primate.,"When exposed to enhanced background noise, humans avoid signal masking by increasing the amplitude of the voice, a phenomenon termed the Lombard effect. This auditory feedback-mediated voice control has also been found in monkeys, bats, cetaceans, fish and some frogs and birds. We studied the Lombard effect for the first time in a phylogenetically basal primate, the grey mouse lemur, Microcebus murinus. When background noise was increased, mouse lemurs were able to raise the amplitude of the voice, comparable to monkeys, but they did not show this effect consistently across context/individuals. The Lombard effect, even if representing a generic vocal communication system property of mammals, may thus be affected by more complex mechanisms. The present findings emphasize an effect of context, and individual, and the need for further standardized approaches to disentangle the multiple system properties of mammalian vocal communication, important for understanding the evolution of the unique human faculty of speech and language.",nonCancer
129,Activating ESR1 mutations in hormone-resistant metastatic breast cancer.,"Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in women, and over two-thirds of cases express estrogen receptor-α (ER-α, encoded by ESR1). Through a prospective clinical sequencing program for advanced cancers, we enrolled 11 patients with ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. Whole-exome and transcriptome analysis showed that six cases harbored mutations of ESR1 affecting its ligand-binding domain (LBD), all of whom had been treated with anti-estrogens and estrogen deprivation therapies. A survey of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) identified four endometrial cancers with similar mutations of ESR1. The five new LBD-localized ESR1 mutations identified here (encoding p.Leu536Gln, p.Tyr537Ser, p.Tyr537Cys, p.Tyr537Asn and p.Asp538Gly) were shown to result in constitutive activity and continued responsiveness to anti-estrogen therapies in vitro. Taken together, these studies suggest that activating mutations in ESR1 are a key mechanism in acquired endocrine resistance in breast cancer therapy.",cancer

We postulated that broader inhibition of ErbB receptors with afatinib would improve clinical outcomes compared with HER2 inhibition alone in patients who had progressed on previous trastuzumab treatment. LUX-Breast 1 compared afatinib plus vinorelbine with trastuzumab plus vinorelbine for such patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We did this open-label trial at 350 hospitals in 41 countries worldwide. We enrolled female patients with HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on or following adjuvant trastuzumab or first-line treatment of metastatic disease with trastuzumab. Participants were randomly assigned (2:1) to receive oral afatinib (40 mg/day) plus intravenous vinorelbine (25 mg/m(2) per week) or intravenous trastuzumab (2 mg/kg per week after 4 mg/kg loading dose) plus vinorelbine. Randomisation was done centrally and stratified by previous trastuzumab treatment (adjuvant vs first-line treatment), hormone receptor status (oestrogen receptor and progesterone receptor positive vs others), and region. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival, assessed in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is closed to enrolment and is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01125566. Between Aug 26, 2010, and April 26, 2013, we enrolled 508 patients: 339 assigned to the afatinib group and 169 assigned to the trastuzumab group. Recruitment was stopped on April 26, 2013, after a benefit-risk assessment by the independent data monitoring committee was unfavourable for the afatinib group. Patients on afatinib plus vinorelbine had to switch to trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, afatinib monotherapy, vinorelbine monotherapy, or receive treatment outside of the trial. Median follow-up was 9·3 months (IQR 3·7-16·0). Median progression-free survival was 5·5 months (95% CI 5·4-5·6) in the afatinib group and 5·6 months (5·3-7·3) in the trastuzumab group (hazard ratio 1·10 95% CI 0·86-1·41; p=0·43). The most common drug-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher were neutropenia (190 [56%] of 337 patients in the afatinib group vs 102 [60%] of 169 patients in the trastuzumab group), leucopenia (64 [19%] vs 34 [20%]), and diarrhoea (60 [18%] vs none). Trastuzumab-based therapy remains the treatment of choice for patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had progressed on trastuzumab. Boehringer Ingelheim.",cancer
2080,Dedifferentiation Effects of Rabbit Regenerating Tissue on Partially Differentiated Cells.,"Cell Stemness can be achieved by various reprogramming techniques namely, somatic cell nuclear transfer, cell fusion, cell extracts, and introduction of transcription factors from which induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are obtained. iPSCs are valuable cell sources for drug screening and human disease modeling. Alternatives to virus-based introduction of transcription factors include application of DNA-free methods and introduction of chemically defined culturing conditions. However, the possibility of tumor development is still a hurdle. By taking advantage of NTERA-2 cells, a human embryonal carcinoma cell line, we obtained partially differentiated cells and examined the dedifferentiation capacity of regenerative tissue from rabbit ears. Results indicated that treatment of partially differentiated NTERA-2 cells with the regenerating tissue-conditioned medium (CM) induced expression of key pluripotency markers as examined by real-time polymerase chain reaction, flow cytometry, and immunocytochemistry techniques. In this study, it is reported for the first time that the CM obtained from rabbit regenerating tissue contains dedifferentiation factors, taking cells back to the pluripotency. This system could be a simple and efficient way to reprogram the differentiated cells and generate iPSCs for clinical applications as this system is not accompanied by any viral vector, and reprograms the cells within 10 days of treatment. The results may convince the genomic experts to study the unknown signaling pathways involved in the dedifferentiation by regenerating tissue-CM to authenticate the reprogramming model.",nonCancer
661,Meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy between KRAS G13D and other KRAS mutant metastatic colorectal cancer tumours.,"Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) tumours harbouring a RAS mutation are associated with a lack of treatment benefit from anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). However, observational evidence has led to speculation that mCRC patients with KRAS G13D mutant (MT) tumours may derive a benefit from treatment with anti-EGFR mAbs. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate whether the efficacy of anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC differs between tumours harbouring a KRAS G13D mutation (KRAS G13D) and KRAS mutations other than G13D (other KRAS MT). Eight RCTs (n = 5967) met the inclusion criteria for assessment of both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). For other KRAS MT the hazard ratio for OS benefit with addition of anti-EGFR mAb therapy was 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]; 0.96, 1.17), compared to 1.08 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.60) for KRAS G13D [test for interaction p=0.99]. In contrast, the hazard ratio for KRAS wild-type (WT) tumours was 0.85 (95% CI; 0.76, 0.95). Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard ratio was 1.07 (95% CI; 0.92, 1.26) for other KRAS MT, 0.96 (95% CI; 0.73, 1.27) for KRAS G13D, and 0.68 (95% CI; 0.54, 0.85) for KRAS WT. Again, the test for interaction (p=0.46) demonstrated no significant difference in PFS benefit for anti-EGFR mAb therapy between KRAS G13D and other KRAS MT. This meta-analysis demonstrates no significant difference between KRAS G13D and other KRAS MT tumours in terms of treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC.",cancer
336,Prediction of response to anti-EGFR antibody-based therapies by multigene sequencing in colorectal cancer patients.,"The anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (moAbs) cetuximab or panitumumab are administered to colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who harbor wild-type RAS proto-oncogenes. However, a percentage of patients do not respond to this treatment. In addition to mutations in the RAS genes, mutations in other genes, such as BRAF, PI3KCA, or PTEN, could be involved in the resistance to anti-EGFR moAb therapy. In order to develop a comprehensive approach for the detection of mutations and to eventually identify other genes responsible for resistance to anti-EGFR moAbs, we investigated a panel of 21 genes by parallel sequencing on the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine platform. We sequenced 65 CRCs that were treated with cetuximab or panitumumab. Among these, 37 samples were responsive and 28 were resistant. We confirmed that mutations in EGFR-pathway genes (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PI3KCA) were relevant for conferring resistance to therapy and could predict response (p = 0.001). After exclusion of KRAS, NRAS, BRAF and PI3KCA combined mutations could still significantly associate to resistant phenotype (p = 0.045, by Fisher exact test). In addition, mutations in FBXW7 and SMAD4 were prevalent in cases that were non-responsive to anti-EGFR moAb. After we combined the mutations of all genes (excluding KRAS), the ability to predict response to therapy improved significantly (p = 0.002, by Fisher exact test). The combination of mutations at KRAS and at the five gene panel demonstrates the usefulness and feasibility of multigene sequencing to assess response to anti-EGFR moAbs. The application of parallel sequencing technology in clinical practice, in addition to its innate ability to simultaneously examine the genetic status of several cancer genes, proved to be more accurate and sensitive than the presently in use traditional approaches.",cancer
2311,"Changes in segmentation and setation along the anterior/posterior axis of the homonomous trunk limbs of a remipede (Crustacea, Arthropoda).","This study describes the segmentation and setation at different developmental stages of the homonomous trunk limbs of the remipede Speleonectes tulumensis Yager, 1987 collected in anchialine caves of the Yucatan Peninsula. Most homonomous trunk limbs originate ventrolaterally and are composed of two protopodal segments, three exopodal segments and four endopodal segments; contralateral limb pairs are united by a sternal bar. However, the last few posterior limbs originate ventrally, are smaller sized, and have regressively fewer segments, suggesting that limb development passes through several intermediate steps beginning with a limb bud. A terminal stage of development is proposed for specimens on which the posterior somite bears a simple bilobate limb bud, and the adjacent somite bears a limb with a protopod comprised of a coxapod and basipod, and with three exopodal and four endopodal segments. On each trunk limb there are 20 serially homologous groups of setae, and the numbers of setae on different limbs usually varies. These groups of setae are arranged linearly and are identified based on the morphology of the setae and their position on the segments. The number of setae in these groups increases gradually from the anterior homonomous limb to a maximum between limbs 8-12; the number then decreases sharply on the more posterior limbs. Changes in the number of setae, which reach a maximum between trunk limbs 8-12, differ from changes in segmentation which vary only over the last few posterior trunk limbs. Following a vector analysis that identified a spatial pattern for these 20 groups of setae among the different homonomous limbs, the hypothesis was confirmed that the number of setae in any given group and any given limb is correlated with the group, with the position of the somite along the body axis, and with the number of somites present on the specimens. This is the first vector analysis used to analyze a pattern of developmental changes in serially homologs of an arthropod. Development of remipede limbs are compared and contrasted with similar copepod limbs. Architecture, particularly the sternal bar uniting contralateral limb pairs, proposed as homologous, and development of trunk limb segmentation of the remipede is generally similar to that of copepods, but the remipede limb differs in several ways including an additional endopodal segment, the proximal, that appears simultaneously with the protopod during development.",nonCancer
654,Correlation of TP53 and MDM2 genotypes and clinical outcome in platinum-treated head and neck cancer patients with more than 10 years' follow-up.,"Adequate biomarkers are still required to optimize therapy in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous carcinomas (HNSCC) treated with chemoradiotherapy (CRT). We updated the follow-up of 66 HNSCC patients treated with CRT we described more than 10 years ago, focusing on SNP Arg/Pro (R/P) at codon 72 and somatic mutations in TP53 and on SNP309 in the MDM2 gene. In wild-type TP53 cases, overall survival (OS) was longer in 72RR and less favorable in 72PP (p = 0.005); when TP53 was mutated, OS was longest in 72PP and less favorable in 72RR and 72RP (p = 0.058). Median OS was significantly shorter in patients with MDM2 SNP309 GG or GT genotypes compared with the TT genotype (p = 0.002). TP53 SNP72 may be useful in selecting patients for CRT, but has to be related to somatic TP53 mutations. The MDM2 SNP309, easily determined in peripheral blood, might be more convenient as a predictive biomarker.",cancer
1690,Sodium Deoxycholate for Submental Contouring.,"The chin and jaw line are integral parts of an individual's aesthetic profile, and the presence of submental fat detracts from this and can lead to displeasure with one's facial appearance. While liposuction and cosmetic surgery are regarded as the gold standard in treating submental fat, surgical intervention is not appealing to all patients and has potential surgical complications including longer recovery, and contour irregularities. Despite ample advances in aesthetic medicine to enhance the appearance of the face, very little is available in non-invasive options to reduce submental fat that has been supported by robust evidence. ATX-101, a proprietary formulation of deoxycholic acid that is synthetically derived, has been extensively explored in a vigorous clinical development program that has established the safety and efficacy of the injectable. It has recently received approval by regulatory authorities in Canada (Belkyra™) and the US (Kybella®) for the treatment of submental fat.",nonCancer
68,Mutation of the Wilms' tumor 1 gene is a poor prognostic factor associated with chemotherapy resistance in normal karyotype acute myeloid leukemia: the United Kingdom Medical Research Council Adult Leukaemia Working Party.,"To determine the clinical relevance of Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene mutations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with normal karyotype (NK). Exons 7 and 9 of WT1 were screened in samples from 470 young adult NK AMLs using a combination of direct sequencing and high-resolution capillary electrophoresis. Overall, 51 mutations were detected in 47 cases (10%): 46 frameshift mutations with insertion/deletion of one to 28 base pairs in exon 7 (n = 45) or exon 9 (n = 1), with a median mutant level of 45% (range, 8% to 86%), and five substitutions in exon 9: D396N (n = 3), H397Y (n = 1) and H397Q (n = 1). Patients with WT1 mutations had an inferior response to induction chemotherapy compared with wild-type cases (complete remission rate, 79% v 90%, odds ratio [OR] = 3.02; 95% CI, 1.17 to 7.82; P = .02), a higher rate of resistant disease (15% v 4%; OR = 9.33; 95% CI, 2.38 to 36.6; P = .001), an increased cumulative incidence of relapse (67% v 43%, hazard ratio [HR] = 3.02; 95% CI, 1.69 to 5.38; P = .0008), with a reduction in both relapse-free survival (22% v 44%; HR = 2.16; 95% CI, 1.32 to 3.55; P = .005) and overall survival (26% v 47%; HR = 1.91; 95% CI, 1.23 to 2.95; P = .007) at 5 years. In multivariate analysis, which included FLT3 internal tandem duplication and NPM1 mutation status, the presence of a WT1 mutation remained an independent adverse prognostic factor. WT1 mutations are a negative prognostic indicator in NK AML and may be suitable for the development of targeted therapy.",cancer
2528,RADIX: rhizoslide platform allowing high throughput digital image analysis of root system expansion.,"Phenotyping of genotype-by-environment interactions in the root-zone is of major importance for crop improvement as the spatial distribution of a plant's root system is crucial for a plant to access water and nutrient resources of the soil. However, so far it is unclear to what extent genetic variations in root system responses to spatially varying soil resources can be utilized for breeding applications. Among others, one limiting factor is the absence of phenotyping platforms allowing the analysis of such interactions.|We developed a system that is able to (a) monitor root and shoot growth synchronously, (b) investigate their dynamic responses and (c) analyse the effect of heterogeneous N distribution to parts of the root system in a split-nutrient setup with a throughput (200 individual maize plants at once) sufficient for mapping of quantitative trait loci or for screens of multiple environmental factors. In a test trial, 24 maize genotypes were grown under split nitrogen conditions and the response of shoot and root growth was investigated. An almost double elongation rate of crown and lateral roots was observed under high N for all genotypes. The intensity of genotype-specific responses varied strongly. For example, elongation of crown roots differed almost two times between the fastest and slowest growing genotype. A stronger selective root placement in the high-N compartment was related to an increased shoot development indicating that early vigour might be related to a more intense foraging behaviour.|To our knowledge, RADIX is the only system currently existing which allows studying the differential response of crown roots to split-nutrient application to quantify foraging behaviour in genome mapping or selection experiments. In doing so, changes in root and shoot development and the connection to plant performance can be investigated.",nonCancer
1178,Acquired resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to gefitinib or erlotinib is associated with a second mutation in the EGFR kinase domain.,"Lung adenocarcinomas from patients who respond to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa) or erlotinib (Tarceva) usually harbor somatic gain-of-function mutations in exons encoding the kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Despite initial responses, patients eventually progress by unknown mechanisms of ""acquired"" resistance. We show that in two of five patients with acquired resistance to gefitinib or erlotinib, progressing tumors contain, in addition to a primary drug-sensitive mutation in EGFR, a secondary mutation in exon 20, which leads to substitution of methionine for threonine at position 790 (T790M) in the kinase domain. Tumor cells from a sixth patient with a drug-sensitive EGFR mutation whose tumor progressed on adjuvant gefitinib after complete resection also contained the T790M mutation. This mutation was not detected in untreated tumor samples. Moreover, no tumors with acquired resistance had KRAS mutations, which have been associated with primary resistance to these drugs. Biochemical analyses of transfected cells and growth inhibition studies with lung cancer cell lines demonstrate that the T790M mutation confers resistance to EGFR mutants usually sensitive to either gefitinib or erlotinib. Interestingly, a mutation analogous to T790M has been observed in other kinases with acquired resistance to another kinase inhibitor, imatinib (Gleevec). In patients with tumors bearing gefitinib- or erlotinib-sensitive EGFR mutations, resistant subclones containing an additional EGFR mutation emerge in the presence of drug. This observation should help guide the search for more effective therapy against a specific subset of lung cancers.",cancer
1459,Quorum Quenching and Microbial Control through Phenolic Extract of Eugenia Uniflora Fruits.,"We describe the characterization of the centesimal composition, mineral and phenolic content of Eugenia uniflora fruit and the determination of the antioxidant, antimicrobial and quorum quenching activities of the pulp phenolic extract. Centesimal composition was determined according to standard methods; trace elements were measured by total reflection X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. The phenolic compounds were extracted by solid-phase chromatography and quantified by spectrophotometry. Antioxidant activity was determined by using 3 different methods. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated against a panel of foodborne microorganisms and antiquorum sensing activity in Chromobacterium violaceum was performed by measuring inhibition of quorum sensing dependent violacein production. The centesimal composition (per 100 g of pulp) was as follows: protein 3.68 ± 0.21 g, lipids 0.02 ± 0.03 g, carbohydrates 10.31 g and fiber 2.06 g. Trace elements (mg/g of pulp) were determined as: K 0.90, Ca 3.36, Fe 0.60, Zn 0.17, Cl 0.56, Cr 0.06, Ni 0.04, and Cu 0.07. The pulp is a source of phenolic compounds and presents antioxidant activity similar to other berries. The fruit phenolic extract inhibited all tested bacteria. We also found that the fruit phenolic extract at low subinhibitory concentrations inhibited up to 96% of violacein production in C. violaceum, likely due to the fruit's phenolic content. This study shows the contribution of E. uniflora phenolic compounds to the antioxidant, antimicrobial and the newly discovered quorum quenching activity, all of which could be used by the food and pharmaceutical industries to develop new functional products.",nonCancer
375,Neuregulin-1-mediated autocrine signaling underlies sensitivity to HER2 kinase inhibitors in a subset of human cancers.,"HER2 kinase inhibitors, such as lapatinib, have demonstrated clinical efficacy in HER2-amplified breast cancers. By profiling nearly 700 human cancer cell lines, we identified a subset of non-HER2 amplified cancer cells with striking sensitivity to HER2 kinase inhibition-particularly from head and neck tumors. These cells were found to depend on a neuregulin-1 (NRG1)-mediated autocrine loop driving HER3 activation, which can be disrupted by lapatinib. Elevated NRG1 expression and activated HER3 are strongly associated with lapatinib sensitivity in vitro, and these biomarkers were enriched in a subset of primary head and neck cancer samples. The findings suggest that patients with NRG1-driven tumors lacking HER2 amplification may derive significant clinical benefit from HER2:HER3-directed therapies.",cancer
2457,Hepatitis B virus X protein mediates yes-associated protein 1 upregulation in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is implicated in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is an important proto-oncogene, which is a downstream effector molecule in the Hippo signaling pathway. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between HBx expression in HCC samples and YAP expression in the Hippo pathway. A total of 20 pathologically confirmed HCC samples, 20 corresponding adjacent non-tumor liver tissues and 5 normal liver tissue samples were collected. The expression of HBx and YAP in the tissues was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The intensity and location of YAP expression were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. YAP mRNA and protein expression levels in HCC samples infected with HBV were significantly higher than those of normal liver tissues. Furthermore, YAP expression was positively correlated with HBx expression in HBV-positive HCC samples. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that YAP was predominantly expressed in the nuclei in HBV-positive HCC tissues. YAP expression was significantly decreased in the normal liver tissue and corresponding adjacent liver tissue when compared with the HCC tissues and by contrast to HCC tissues, YAP was predominantly located in the cytoplasm. In conclusion, these results indicate that the YAP gene is a key driver of HBx-induced liver cancer. Therefore, YAP may present a novel target in the treatment of HBV-associated HCC.",nonCancer
562,Oncogenic and drug-sensitive NTRK1 rearrangements in lung cancer.,We identified new gene fusions in patients with lung cancer harboring the kinase domain of the NTRK1 gene that encodes the high-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (TRKA protein). Both the MPRIP-NTRK1 and CD74-NTRK1 fusions lead to constitutive TRKA kinase activity and are oncogenic. Treatment of cells expressing NTRK1 fusions with inhibitors of TRKA kinase activity inhibited autophosphorylation of TRKA and cell growth. Tumor samples from 3 of 91 patients with lung cancer (3.3%) without known oncogenic alterations assayed by next-generation sequencing or fluorescence in situ hybridization demonstrated evidence of NTRK1 gene fusions.,cancer
1873,CLD1 Reverses the Ubiquinone Insufficiency of Mutant cat5/coq7 in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae Model System.,"Ubiquinone (Qn) functions as a mobile electron carrier in mitochondria. In humans, Q biosynthetic pathway mutations lead to Q10 deficiency, a life threatening disorder. We have used a Saccharomyces cerevisiae model of Q6 deficiency to screen for new modulators of ubiquinone biosynthesis. We generated several hypomorphic alleles of coq7/cat5 (clk-1 in Caenorhabditis elegans) encoding the penultimate enzyme in Q biosynthesis which converts 5-demethoxy Q6 (DMQ6) to 5-demethyl Q6, and screened for genes that, when overexpressed, suppressed their inability to grow on non-fermentable ethanol-implying recovery of lost mitochondrial function. Through this approach we identified Cardiolipin-specific Deacylase 1 (CLD1), a gene encoding a phospholipase A2 required for cardiolipin acyl remodeling. Interestingly, not all coq7 mutants were suppressed by Cld1p overexpression, and molecular modeling of the mutant Coq7p proteins that were suppressed showed they all contained disruptions in a hydrophobic α-helix that is predicted to mediate membrane-binding. CLD1 overexpression in the suppressible coq7 mutants restored the ratio of DMQ6 to Q6 toward wild type levels, suggesting recovery of lost Coq7p function. Identification of a spontaneous Cld1p loss-of-function mutation illustrated that Cld1p activity was required for coq7 suppression. This observation was further supported by HPLC-ESI-MS/MS profiling of monolysocardiolipin, the product of Cld1p. In summary, our results present a novel example of a lipid remodeling enzyme reversing a mitochondrial ubiquinone insufficiency by facilitating recovery of hypomorphic enzymatic function.",nonCancer
2332,Imaging Techniques for Clinical Burn Assessment with a Focus on Multispectral Imaging.,"Significance: Burn assessments, including extent and severity, are some of the most critical diagnoses in burn care, and many recently developed imaging techniques may have the potential to improve the accuracy of these evaluations. Recent Advances: Optical devices, telemedicine, and high-frequency ultrasound are among the highlights in recent burn imaging advancements. We present another promising technology, multispectral imaging (MSI), which also has the potential to impact current medical practice in burn care, among a variety of other specialties. Critical Issues: At this time, it is still a matter of debate as to why there is no consensus on the use of technology to assist burn assessments in the United States. Fortunately, the availability of techniques does not appear to be a limitation. However, the selection of appropriate imaging technology to augment the provision of burn care can be difficult for clinicians to navigate. There are many technologies available, but a comprehensive review summarizing the tissue characteristics measured by each technology in light of aiding clinicians in selecting the proper device is missing. This would be especially valuable for the nonburn specialists who encounter burn injuries. Future Directions: The questions of when burn assessment devices are useful to the burn team, how the various imaging devices work, and where the various burn imaging technologies fit into the spectrum of burn care will continue to be addressed. Technologies that can image a large surface area quickly, such as thermography or laser speckle imaging, may be suitable for initial burn assessment and triage. In the setting of presurgical planning, ultrasound or optical microscopy techniques, including optical coherence tomography, may prove useful. MSI, which actually has origins in burn care, may ultimately meet a high number of requirements for burn assessment in routine clinical use.",nonCancer
1106,The Hippo Coactivator YAP1 Mediates EGFR Overexpression and Confers Chemoresistance in Esophageal Cancer.,"Esophageal cancer is an aggressive malignancy and often resistant to therapy. Overexpression of EGFR has been associated with poor prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer. However, clinical trials using EGFR inhibitors have not provided benefit for patients with esophageal cancer. Failure of EGFR inhibition may be due to crosstalk with other oncogenic pathways. In this study, expression of YAP1 and EGFR were examined in EAC-resistant tumor tissues versus sensitive tissues by IHC. Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, real-time PCR, promoter analysis, site-directed mutagenesis, and in vitro and in vivo functional assays were performed to elucidate the YAP1-mediated EGFR expression and transcription and the relationship with chemoresistance in esophageal cancer. We demonstrate that Hippo pathway coactivator YAP1 can induce EGFR expression and transcription in multiple cell systems. Both YAP1 and EGFR are overexpressed in resistant esophageal cancer tissues compared with sensitive esophageal cancer tissues. Furthermore, we found that YAP1 increases EGFR expression at the level of transcription requiring an intact TEAD-binding site in the EGFR promoter. Most importantly, exogenous induction of YAP1 induces resistance to 5-fluorouracil and docetaxcel, whereas knockdown of YAP1 sensitizes esophageal cancer cells to these cytotoxics. Verteporfin, a YAP1 inhibitor, effectively inhibits both YAP1 and EGFR expression and sensitizes cells to cytotoxics. Our data provide evidence that YAP1 upregulation of EGFR plays an important role in conferring therapy resistance in esophageal cancer cells. Targeting YAP1-EGFR axis may be more efficacious than targeting EGFR alone in esophageal cancer.",cancer
1957,The impact of frailty on failure-to-rescue in geriatric trauma patients: A prospective study.,"Failure-to-rescue (FTR) (defined as death from a major complication) is considered as an index of hospital quality in trauma patients. However, the role of frailty in FTR events remains unclear. We hypothesized that FTR rate is higher in elderly frail trauma patients.|We performed a prospective cohort study of all elderly (age ≥ 65 yrs.) trauma patients presenting at our level one trauma center. Patient's frailty status was calculated utilizing the Trauma Specific Frailty Index (TSFI) within 24 hours of admission. Patients were stratified into: non-frail, pre-frail, and frail. FTR was defined as death from a major complication (respiratory, infectious, cardiac, and renal). Binary logistic regression analysis was performed after adjusting for age, gender, injury severity (ISS), and vital parameters to assess the relationship between frailty status and FTR.|A total of 368 elderly trauma patients were evaluated of which 25% (n=93) were non-frail, 38% (n=139) pre-frail, and 37% (n=136) frail. Overall 30% of the patients developed in-hospital complications of them mortality occurred in 26% of the patients (FTR group). In the FTR group 69% of the patients were frail compared to 17% pre-frail and 14% non-frail (p=0.002). On multivariate regression analysis for predictors of FTR, frail status was an independent predictor of FTR (OR, 95% [CI] = 2.67[1.37 - 5.20]; p=0.004). On sensitivity analysis, positive predictive value of TSFI for FTR was 69% and negative predictive value for FTR was 67%.|In elderly trauma patients, the presence of frailty increased the odds of FTR almost three-fold as compared to non-frail. Although FTR has been considered as an indicator of health care quality, the findings of this study suggest that frailty status independently contributes to FTR. This needs to be considered in the future development of quality metrics, particularly in the case of geriatric trauma patients.|Level II, Prognostic Studies - Investigating the Effect of a Patient Characteristic on the Outcome of Disease.",nonCancer
1850,A Model for the Departmental Quality Management Infrastructure Within an Academic Health System.,"As quality improvement and patient safety come to play a larger role in health care, academic medical centers and health systems are poised to take a leadership role in addressing these issues. Academic medical centers can leverage their large integrated footprint and have the ability to innovate in this field. However, a robust quality management infrastructure is needed to support these efforts. In this context, quality and safety are often described at the executive level and at the unit level. Yet, the role of individual departments, which are often the dominant functional unit within a hospital, in realizing health system quality and safety goals has not been addressed. Developing a departmental quality management infrastructure is challenging because departments are diverse in composition, size, resources, and needs.In this article, the authors describe the model of departmental quality management infrastructure that has been implemented at the Johns Hopkins Hospital. This model leverages the fractal approach, linking departments horizontally to support peer and organizational learning and connecting departments vertically to support accountability to the hospital, health system, and board of trustees. This model also provides both structure and flexibility to meet individual departmental needs, recognizing that independence and interdependence are needed for large academic medical centers. The authors describe the structure, function, and support system for this model as well as the practical and essential steps for its implementation. They also provide examples of its early success.",nonCancer

Targeting KIT has led to a new treatment paradigm in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). KIT is a cell surface receptor with tyrosine kinases that, upon binding of its ligand, stem cell factor, activates various signaling pathways. Imatinib and sunitinib, both tyrosine kinase inhibitors directed to KIT, were approved for first- and second-line treatment of metastatic and unresectable GISTs. In this article, we will review the molecular pathogenesis of GISTs followed by a discussion of imatinib and sunitinib's role in the treatment of GISTs. Finally, we will introduce novel therapeutic options for imatinib- and sunitinib-resistant GISTs.",cancer
1764,Femoral Neck Aspiration Aids in the Diagnosis of Osteomyelitis In Children With Septic Hip.,"The role of femoral aspiration (FA) in the treatment of septic arthritis of the hip is controversial. The purpose of this study was to determine if FA conducted concomitantly with irrigation and debridement (I&D) of the septic hip aids in microorganism and osteomyelitis identification and alters the treatment plan, or if the risks of the procedure outweigh its potential benefit. We also compare preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with FA for diagnosis of osteomyelitis cooccurring with septic arthritis.|Retrospective review was performed of all patients treated at a single institution between January 2003 and June 2014 for suspected septic hip arthritis. Eighty-three patients were identified with suspected or confirmed septic arthritis and 28 patients (33%) had cooccurring osteomyelitis. Demographic and clinical data were recorded for each patient. The sensitivity and specificity of FA and MRI for diagnosing osteomyelitis were determined.|Among the 83 patients with confirmed or suspected septic arthritis, 31 patients (37%) had a FA performed at the time of the hip I&D, resulting in positive cultures in 17 patients. All of these patients had other positive cultures (blood and/or joint fluid) that grew the same organism. 54 patients (65%) had a preoperative MRI. The MRI was falsely negative in 10 patients, 6 of whom had a positive FA resulting in appropriate management of osteomyelitis. Missed or delayed diagnosis of osteomyelitis resulted in significant morbidity in 3 patients (avascular necrosis and femoral neck fracture, extensive lower extremity osteomyelitis, and subtrochanteric fracture with malunion). No complications associated with FA were identified. FA and MRI were found to have sensitivity/specificity for osteomyelitis of 100%/100% and 38%/95%, respectively.|Although FA did not improve microorganism identification, it did aid in the diagnosis of cooccurring osteomyelitis when treating children with septic arthritis, especially in patients with false negative MRI findings for osteomyelitis. We recommend FA at the time of septic hip I&D as its benefits appear to far outweigh its risks.|Level III-diagnostic study.",nonCancer
2194,First evidence of HERV-H transcriptional activity reduction after methylphenidate treatment in a young boy with ADHD.,"Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs) have been associated with many complex diseases including neuropsychiatric diseases, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In ADHD an over-expression of HERV-H family in peripheral blood mononuclear cells has been documented. It has been hypothesized that HERVs may represent the link between genetic and environmental risk factors, contributing to the clinical onset and/or to the progression of the neurodevelopmental disease. The effect of pharmacological treatment on HERV transcriptional activity in psychiatric disorders has been attracting attention. Using a real-time RT-PCR we investigated the influence of methylphenidate on HERV transcription in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of a young patient with ADHD. In this clinical case we describe for the first time the reduction of HERV-H expression and the significant improvement of ADHD symptoms after 6 months of methylphenidate treatment.",nonCancer
1848,Improving the Medical Student Performance Evaluation to Facilitate Resident Selection.,"The Medical Student Performance Evaluation (MSPE) was introduced as a refinement of the prior ""dean's letter"" to provide residency program directors with a standardized comprehensive assessment of a medical student's performance throughout medical school. The author argues that, although the MSPE was created with good intentions, many have questioned its efficacy in predicting performance during residency. The author asserts that, despite decades of use and some acknowledged improvement, the MSPE remains a suboptimal tool for informing program directors' decisions about which applicants to interview and rank. In the current approach to MSPEs, there may even be some inherent conflicts of interest that cannot be overcome. In January 2015, an MSPE Task Force was created to review the MSPE over three years and recommend changes to its next iteration. The author believes, however, that expanding this collaborative effort between undergraduate and graduate medical education and other stakeholders could optimize the MSPE's standardization and transparency. The author offers six recommendations for achieving this goal: developing a truly standardized MSPE template; improving faculty accountability in student assessment; enhancing transparency in the MSPE; reconsidering the authorship responsibility of the MSPE; including assessment of compliance with administrative tasks and peer assessments in student evaluations; and embracing milestones for evaluation of medical student performance.",nonCancer
2338,Response of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation patients administered a combined quebracho/conker tree/M. balsamea Willd extract.,"The aim of this case series was to retrospectively examine the symptom response of irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) patients administered an herbal extract in a real-world setting. Twenty-four IBS-C patients in a community office practice were provided a combination over-the-counter dietary supplement composed of quebracho (150 mg), conker tree (470 mg) and M. balsamea Willd (0.2 mL) extracts (Atrantil™) and chose to take the formulation for a minimum of 2 wk in an attempt to manage their symptoms. Patient responses to the supplement were assessed by visual analogue scale (VAS) for abdominal pain, constipation and bloating at baseline and at 2 wk as part of standard-of-care. Patient scores from VAS assessments recorded in medical chart data were retrospectively compiled and assessed for the effects of the combined extract on symptoms. Sign tests were used to compare changes from baseline to 2 wk of taking the extract. Significance was defined as P < 0.05. Twenty-one of 24 patients (88%) responded to the dietary supplement as measured by individual improvements in VAS scores for abdominal pain, bloating and constipation symptoms comparing scores prior to administration of the extract against those reported after 2 wk. There were also significant improvements in individual as well as mean VAS scores after 2 wk of administration of the combined extract compared to baseline for abdominal pain [8.0 (6.5, 9.0) vs 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P < 0.001], bloating [8.0 (7.0, 9.0) vs 1.0 (1.0, 2.0), P < 0.001] and constipation [6.0 (3.0, 8.0) vs 2.0 (1.0, 3.0), P < 0.001], respectively. In addition, 21 of 24 patients expressed improved quality of life while taking the formulation. There were no reported side effects to administration of the dietary supplement in this practice population suggesting excellent tolerance of the formulation. This pilot retrospective analysis of symptom scores from patients before and after consuming a quebracho/conker tree/M. balsamea Willd extract may support the formulation's use in IBS-C.",nonCancer

A suppressed luteinising hormone (LH) response (LH peak ≤3 IU/l) to the gonadotrophin-releasing hormone test at 3 months (primary endpoint) occurred in 83.8 and 82.8% of the cases in the TP and the TA Study, respectively. At 6 months, a suppressed LH response occurred in 86.5 and 96.8% of the cases in the TP and the TA Study, respectively. Pubertal development was slowed in both studies. Adverse events were mild to moderate and resolved without sequelae in the TP Study.|Triptorelin pamoate 11.25 mg administered at 3-month intervals is an effective and well-tolerated treatment in patients with CPP.

926,Correlation of Aurora-A expression with the effect of chemoradiation therapy on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma.,"Chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is one of the most useful treatments for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). However, because some patients respond well to CRT and others do not, it is important to be able to predict response to CRT before beginning treatment by using markers. Aurora-A encodes a cell cycle regulated serine/threonine kinase that has essential functions in centrosome maturation and chromosome segregation. In this study, we investigated the relationship between the expression of Aurora-A and the response to CRT in patients with ESCC. We immunohistochemically investigated the expression of Aurora-A in biopsy specimens of untreated primary tumors of 78 patients with ESCC and determined the relationship between Aurora-A levels and patient responses to CRT, which consisted of 5-fluorouracil plus cisplatin and 40 Gy of radiation. Tumors were judged as Aurora-A positive when more than 10% of the cancer cells displayed a distinct positive nuclear anti-Aurora-A immunoreaction by immunohistochemical evaluation. The tumors of 46 of 78 patients (58.9%) displayed positive expression of Aurora-A. In terms of clinical response the percentage of patients showing complete response (CR), incomplete response/stable disease of primary lesion (IR/SD), and progressive disease (PD) was 19.2, 69.2, and 11.5%, respectively. In terms of histological response the tumor grade of the 41 patients who underwent surgery was as follows: grade 1, 48.8%; grade 2, 29.2%; grade 3, 22.0%. CRT was effective for patients who had Aurora-A (+) tumors (clinically: P = 0.0003, histologically: P = 0.036). Our results suggest that Aurora-A expression in biopsy specimens of primary tumors is associated with CRT efficacy in patients with ESCC. Assessment of Aurora-A expression in biopsy specimens maybe useful for regarding the potential utility of CRT therapy for patients with ESCC before treatment.",cancer

Significant treatment mean values were subjected to post-hoc Tukey's test.|Celecoxib showed marked cytotoxic effects on KB, Saos-2, and 1321N cells, which was significant in comparison with the control group. Celecoxib was not effective in killing U-87MG cell line. Mefenamic acid exerted cytotoxic effects on KB, Saos-2, and 1321N cells, where the viability was approximately 75%. U-87MG cells were resistant to mefenamic acid. Indometacin had the highest rate of activity on U-87MG cells, which was significant in comparison with the control group. Aspirin did not exhibit any activity on these cell lines and was not effective in killing U-87MG, KB, Saos-2, and 1321N cells.|This research showed that celecoxib, indometacin, and mefenamic acid have the cytotoxic effects on KB, Saos-2, 1321N and U-87MG cell lines. Therefore, it appears that these drugs can be considered as anti-neoplastic agents in the experimental phase.",nonCancer
309,Inhibitor-sensitive FGFR1 amplification in human non-small cell lung cancer.,"Squamous cell lung carcinomas account for approximately 25% of new lung carcinoma cases and 40,000 deaths per year in the United States. Although there are multiple genomically targeted therapies for lung adenocarcinoma, none has yet been reported in squamous cell lung carcinoma. Using SNP array analysis, we found that a region of chromosome segment 8p11-12 containing three genes-WHSC1L1, LETM2, and FGFR1-is amplified in 3% of lung adenocarcinomas and 21% of squamous cell lung carcinomas. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line harboring focal amplification of FGFR1 is dependent on FGFR1 activity for cell growth, as treatment of this cell line either with FGFR1-specific shRNAs or with FGFR small molecule enzymatic inhibitors leads to cell growth inhibition. These studies show that FGFR1 amplification is common in squamous cell lung cancer, and that FGFR1 may represent a promising therapeutic target in non-small cell lung cancer.",cancer
1457,Modelling the Dynamics of Post-Vaccination Immunity Rate in a Population of Sahelian Sheep after a Vaccination Campaign against Peste des Petits Ruminants Virus.,"Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) is an acute infectious viral disease affecting domestic small ruminants (sheep and goats) and some wild ruminant species in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. A global PPR control strategy based on mass vaccination-in regions where PPR is endemic-was recently designed and launched by international organizations. Sahelian Africa is one of the most challenging endemic regions for PPR control. Indeed, strong seasonal and annual variations in mating, mortality and offtake rates result in a complex population dynamics which might in turn alter the population post-vaccination immunity rate (PIR), and thus be important to consider for the implementation of vaccination campaigns.|In a context of preventive vaccination in epidemiological units without PPR virus transmission, we developed a predictive, dynamic model based on a seasonal matrix population model to simulate PIR dynamics. This model was mostly calibrated with demographic and epidemiological parameters estimated from a long-term follow-up survey of small ruminant herds. We used it to simulate the PIR dynamics following a single PPR vaccination campaign in a Sahelian sheep population, and to assess the effects of (i) changes in offtake rate related to the Tabaski (a Muslim feast following the lunar calendar), and (ii) the date of implementation of the vaccination campaigns.|The persistence of PIR was not influenced by the Tabaski date. Decreasing the vaccination coverage from 100 to 80% had limited effects on PIR. However, lower vaccination coverage did not provide sufficient immunity rates (PIR < 70%). As a trade-off between model predictions and other considerations like animal physiological status, and suitability for livestock farmers, we would suggest to implement vaccination campaigns in September-October. This model is a first step towards better decision support for animal health authorities. It might be adapted to other species, livestock farming systems or diseases.",nonCancer
1795,Record Low Thermal Conductivity of Polycrystalline Si Nanowire: Breaking the Casimir Limit by Severe Suppression of Propagons.,"Thermoelectrics offer an attractive pathway for addressing an important niche in the globally growing landscape of energy demand. Nanoengineering existing low-dimensional thermoelectric materials pertaining to realizing fundamentally low thermal conductivity has emerged as an efficient route to achieve high energy conversion performance for advanced thermoelectrics. In this paper, by performing nonequilibrium and Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations we report that the thermal conductivity of Si nanowires (NWs) in polycrystalline form can reach a record low value substantially below the Casimir limit, a theory of diffusive boundary limit that regards the direction-averaged mean free path is limited by the characteristic size of the nanostructures. The astonishingly low thermal conductivity of polycrystalline Si NW is 269 and 77 times lower with respect to that of bulk Si and pristine Si NW, respectively, and is even only about one-third of the value of the purely amorphous Si NW at room temperature. By examining the mode level phonon behaviors including phonon group velocities, lifetime, and so forth, we identify the mechanism of breaking the Casimir limit as the strong localization of the middle and high frequency phonon modes, which leads to a prominent decrease of effective mean free path of the heat carriers including both propagons and diffusons. The contribution of the propagons to the overall thermal transport is further quantitatively characterized and is found to be dramatically suppressed in polycrystalline Si NW form as compared with bulk Si, perfect Si NW, and pure amorphous Si NW. Consequently, the diffusons, which transport the heat through overlap with other vibrations, carry the majority of the heat in polycrystalline Si NWs. We also proposed approach of introducing ""disorder"" in the polycrystalline Si NWs that could eradicate the contribution of propagons to achieve an even lower thermal conductivity than that ever thought possible. Our investigation provides a deep insight into the thermal transport in polycrystalline NWs and offers a promising strategy to construct a new kind of semiconducting thermoelectric NW with high figure of merit.",nonCancer
769,"Prevalence, clinical profile, and prognosis of NPM mutations in AML with normal karyotype.","Mutation of the nucleophosmin (NPM) gene has been reported as the most frequent mutation in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), especially in the presence of a normal karyotype. In this subgroup of intermediate-risk AML, the identification of other gene mutations (eg, FLT3, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-alpha [CEBPA]) has helped to refine the prognosis. This study explored the prevalence and the prognostic impact of NPM mutations in a cohort of 106 patients with normal-karyotype AML. NPM exon 12 mutations were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and fragment analysis for the insertion/deletion globally resulting in a 4-bp insertion. NPM mutations were detected in 47% of patients and were associated with a high white blood cell count, involvement of the monocytic lineage (M4/M5), and a decreased prevalence of CEBPA mutations. Complete remission rate and long-term outcome did not differ between NPM-mutated and -nonmutated patients. Prospective studies are needed to confirm the definitive place of NPM mutation detection to predict AML response to therapy.",cancer
1421,The Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase Class III Complex Containing TcVps15 and TcVps34 Participates in Autophagy in Trypanosoma cruzi.,"Autophagy is a degradative process by which eukaryotic cells digest their own components to provide aminoacids that may function as energy source under nutritional stress conditions. There is experimental evidence for autophagy in parasitic protists belonging to the family Trypanosomatidae. However, few proteins implicated in this process have been characterized so far in these parasites. Moreover, it has been shown that autophagy is involved in Trypanosoma cruzi differentiation and thus might have a role in pathogenicity. Here we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of TcVps15. In addition, we demonstrate that TcVps15 interact with the PI3K TcVps34 and that both proteins associate with cellular membranes. Under nutritional stress conditions, TcVps15 and TcVps34 modify their subcellular distribution showing a partial co-localization in autophagosomes with TcAtg8.1 and by using an active site TcVps15 mutated version (TcVps15-K219D-HA) we demonstrated that this relocalization depends on the TcVps15 catalytic activity. Overexpression of TcVps15-HA and TcVps15-K219D-HA also leads to increased accumulation of monodansylcadaverine (MDC) in autophagic vacuoles under nutritional stress conditions compared to wild type cells. In addition, the MDC specific activity shows to be significantly higher in TcVps15-HA overexpressing cells when compared with TcVps15-K219D-HA. Our results reveal for the first time a role of TcVps15 as a key regulator of TcVps34 enzymatic activity and implicate the TcVps15-Vps34 complex in autophagy in T. cruzi, exposing a new key pathway to explore novel chemotherapeutic targets.

1077,"Gefitinib versus cisplatin plus docetaxel in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (WJTOG3405): an open label, randomised phase 3 trial.","Patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene respond well to the EGFR-specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib. However, whether gefitinib is better than standard platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients selected by EGFR mutation is uncertain. We did an open label, phase 3 study (WJTOG3405) with recruitment between March 31, 2006, and June 22, 2009, at 36 centres in Japan. 177 chemotherapy-naive patients aged 75 years or younger and diagnosed with stage IIIB/IV non-small-cell lung cancer or postoperative recurrence harbouring EGFR mutations (either the exon 19 deletion or L858R point mutation) were randomly assigned, using a minimisation technique, to receive either gefitinib (250 mg/day orally; n=88) or cisplatin (80 mg/m(2), intravenously) plus docetaxel (60 mg/m(2), intravenously; n=89), administered every 21 days for three to six cycles. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Survival analysis was done with the modified intention-to-treat population. This study is registered with UMIN (University Hospital Medical Information Network in Japan), number 000000539. Five patients were excluded (two patients were found to have thyroid and colon cancer after randomisation, one patient had an exon 18 mutation, one patient had insufficient consent, and one patient showed acute allergic reaction to docetaxel). Thus, 172 patients (86 in each group) were included in the survival analyses. The gefitinib group had significantly longer progression-free survival compared with the cisplatin plus docetaxel goup, with a median progression-free survival time of 9.2 months (95% CI 8.0-13.9) versus 6.3 months (5.8-7.8; HR 0.489, 95% CI 0.336-0.710, log-rank p<0.0001). Myelosuppression, alopecia, and fatigue were more frequent in the cisplatin plus docetaxel group, but skin toxicity, liver dysfunction, and diarrhoea were more frequent in the gefitinib group. Two patients in the gefitinib group developed interstitial lung disease (incidence 2.3%), one of whom died. Patients with lung cancer who are selected by EGFR mutations have longer progression-free survival if they are treated with gefitinib than if they are treated with cisplatin plus docetaxel.

443,A 3'-UTR KRAS-variant is associated with cisplatin resistance in patients with recurrent and/or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"A germline mutation in the 3'-untranslated region of KRAS (rs61764370, KRAS-variant: TG/GG) has previously been associated with altered patient outcome and drug resistance/sensitivity in various cancers. We examined the prognostic and predictive significance of this variant in recurrent/metastatic (R/M) head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). We conducted a retrospective study of 103 HNSCCs collected from three completed clinical trials. KRAS-variant genotyping was conducted for these samples and 8 HNSCC cell lines. p16 expression was determined in a subset of 26 oropharynx tumors by immunohistochemistry. Microarray analysis was also utilized to elucidate differentially expressed genes between KRAS-variant and non-variant tumors. Drug sensitivity in cell lines was evaluated to confirm clinical findings. KRAS-variant status was determined in 95/103 (92%) of the HNSCC tumor samples and the allelic frequency of TG/GG was 32% (30/95). Three of the HNSCC cell lines (3/8) studied had the KRAS-variant. No association between KRAS-variant status and p16 expression was observed in the oropharynx subset (Fisher's exact test, P = 1.0). With respect to patient outcome, patients with the KRAS-variant had poor progression-free survival when treated with cisplatin (log-rank P = 0.002). Conversely, KRAS-variant patients appeared to experience some improvement in disease control when cetuximab was added to their platinum-based regimen (log-rank P = 0.04). The TG/GG rs61764370 KRAS-variant is a potential predictive biomarker for poor platinum response in R/M HNSCC patients. NCT00503997, NCT00425750, NCT00003809.",cancer
1203,Correlation of kinase genotype and clinical outcome in the North American Intergroup Phase III Trial of imatinib mesylate for treatment of advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor: CALGB 150105 Study by Cancer and Leukemia Group B and Southwest Oncology Group.,"Imatinib mesylate is standard treatment for patients who have advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), but not all patients benefit equally. In previous studies, GIST genotype correlated with treatment outcome and optimal imatinib dosing. We examined the relationship between kinase genotype and treatment outcome for 428 patients enrolled on the North American phase III study SWOG S0033/CALGB 150105 and treated with either 400 mg or 800 mg daily doses of imatinib. The presence of KIT exon 11-mutant genotype (n = 283) correlated with improved treatment outcome when compared with KIT exon 9-mutant (n = 32) and wild-type (WT; n = 67) genotypes for objective response (complete response [CR]/partial response [PR], 71.7% v 44.4% [P = .007]; and 44.6% [P = .0002], respectively); time to tumor progression (TTP; median 24.7 months v 16.7 and 12.8 months, respectively); and overall survival (OS; median 60.0 months v 38.4 and 49.0 months, respectively). The survival outcomes for patients with exon 9-mutant, exon 11-mutant or WT GIST were not affected by imatinib dose. However, there was evidence of improved response rates for patients with exon 9-mutant tumors treated with imatinib 800 mg versus 400 mg (CR/PR, 67% v 17%; P = .02). Patients who had CD117-negative GIST had similar TTP but inferior OS compared with patients who had CD117-positive disease, which suggests that patients who have CD117-negative GIST may benefit from imatinib treatment. In addition, we identified novel but rare mutations of the KIT extracellular domain (exons 8 and 9). We confirmed the favorable impact of KIT exon 11 genotype when compared with KIT exon 9 and wild-type genotype for patients with advanced GIST who are treated with imatinib.",cancer
1255,MAP2K1 (MEK1) Mutations Define a Distinct Subset of Lung Adenocarcinoma Associated with Smoking.,"Genetic alterations affecting the MAPK/ERK pathway are common in lung adenocarcinoma (LAD). Early steps of the signaling pathway are most often affected with EGFR, KRAS, and BRAF mutations encompassing more than 70% of all alterations. Somatic mutations in MEK1, located downstream of BRAF, are rare and remain poorly defined as a distinct molecular subset. Tumors harboring MEK1 mutations were identified through targeted screening of a large LAD cohort concurrently interrogated for recurrent mutations in MEK1, EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2/HER2, NRAS, PIK3CA, and AKT. Additional cases were identified through a search of publically available cancer genomic datasets. Mutations were correlated with patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. Overall survival was compared with stage-matched patients with KRAS- and EGFR-mutant LADs. We identified 36 MEK1-mutated cases among 6,024 LAD (0.6%; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-0.85). The majority of patients were smokers (97%, n = 35/36). There was no association with age, sex, race, or stage. The most common mutations were K57N (64%, 23/36) followed by Q56P (19%, 7/36), all mutually exclusive with other driver mutations in the targeted panel. Transversions G:C>T:A were predominant (89%, 31/35), in keeping with smoking-associated DNA damage. Additional less common somatic mutations were identified in the kinase domain, all of which are predicted to converge into a single interaction area based on in silico 3D modeling. MEK1 mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Mutations are predominantly transversions, in keeping with a strong association with smoking.",cancer
2447,Rapid bone repair in a patient with lung cancer metastases to the spine using a novel herbal medicine: A case report.,"The prognosis of lung carcinoma with metastasis to the bone, particularly to the spine, is poor. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are established treatments for metastatic bone disease, but their effectiveness is unsatisfactory and bone repair following their use is slow and difficult. Medicine prepared from herbal extracts may be an alternative treatment option. The present study discusses the case of a 59-year-old patient diagnosed with squamous cell lung cancer (T2N3M1) in which first-line chemotherapy using docetaxel plus cisplatin failed. Heavy multiple bone metastases were detected in the T9 vertebra and sixth left rib, resulting in a high risk of pathological fracture. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and numerical rating scale (NRS) scores of pain were 2 and 4, respectively. A second-line treatment was chosen consisting of biological intracontrol treatment (BICT) plus bisphosphonates administered over 40 days. BICT is a therapy involving the use of herbal extracts (including ginseng, herba agrimoniae, hairyvein agrimonia herb, white flower patrinia herb and arginine) and palliative care. A partial positive response was reached following use of this regimen, particularly with regard to bone repair. A computed tomography scan revealed a 90% reduction in the broken area of the rib cage and T9 vertebra. The bone repair was rapid and almost complete. In addition, growth of the primary tumor in the right pulmonary hilar and metastasis in the mediastinal lymph nodes were stabilized following treatment. ECOG and NRS scores were decreased to 1 and 0, respectively, leading to an improved quality of life. Based on these results, the present study suggests that this herbal medicine-based regimen promotes bone repair and inhibits tumor growth, with low toxicity. However, the mechanism by which herbal medicine promotes rapid bone repair is unclear. Further studies are required to determine whether cells in the tumor microenvironment are stimulated to undergo re-differentiation by unidentified herbal substances.",nonCancer
2034,Inhibition of never in mitosis A (NIMA)-related kinase-4 reduces survivin expression and sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced cell death.,"The tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) preferentially induces apoptosis in cancer cells. However, many tumors are resistant to TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and resistance mechanisms are not fully understood. To identify novel regulatory molecules of TRAIL resistance, we screened a siRNA library targeting the human kinome, and NEK4 (NIMA-related kinase-4) was identified. Knockdown of NEK4 sensitized TRAIL-resistant cancer cells and in vivo xenografts to cell death. In contrast, over expression of NEK4 suppressed TRAIL-induced cell death in TRAIL-sensitive cancer cells. In addition, loss of NEK4 resulted in decrease of the anti-apoptotic protein survivin, but an increase in apoptotic cell death. Interestingly, NEK4 was highly upregulated in tumor tissues derived from patients with lung cancer and colon cancer. These results suggest that inhibition of NEK4 sensitizes cancer cells to TRAIL-induced apoptosis by regulation of survivin expression.",nonCancer

However, 10-15% TSC patients have no mutation identified with conventional molecular diagnostic studies. We used the ultra-deep pyrosequencing technique of 454 Sequencing to search for mosaicism in 38 TSC patients who had no TSC1 or TSC2 mutation identified by conventional methods. Two TSC2 mutations were identified, each at 5.3% read frequency in different patients, consistent with mosaicism. Both mosaic mutations were confirmed by several methods. Five of 38 samples were found to have heterozygous non-mosaic mutations, which had been missed in earlier analyses. Several other possible low-frequency mosaic mutations were identified by deep sequencing, but were discarded as artifacts by secondary studies. The low frequency of detection of mosaic mutations, two (6%) of 33, suggests that the majority of TSC patients who have no mutation identified are not due to mosaicism, but rather other causes, which remain to be determined. These findings indicate the ability of deep sequencing, coupled with secondary confirmatory analyses, to detect low-frequency mosaic mutations.",cancer

174,"The clinical value of somatic TP53 gene mutations in 1,794 patients with breast cancer.","To investigate the clinical value of somatic TP53 mutations in breast cancer, we assembled clinical and molecular data on 1,794 women with primary breast cancer with long-term follow-up and whose tumor has been screened for mutation in exons 5 to 8 of TP53 by gene sequencing. TP53 mutations were more frequent in tumors of ductal and medullar types, aggressive phenotype (high grade, large size, node positive cases, and low hormone receptor content) and in women <60 years old. TP53 mutations within exons 5 to 8 conferred an elevated risk of breast cancer-specific death of 2.27 (relative risk >10 years; P < 0.0001) compared with patients with no such mutation. The prognostic value of TP53 mutation was independent of tumor size, node status, and hormone receptor content, confirming and reconciling previous findings in smaller series. Moreover, an interaction between TP53 mutation and progesterone receptor (PR) status was revealed, TP53 mutation combined with the absence of progesterone receptor being associated with the worst prognosis. Whereas previous studies have emphasized the fact that missense mutations in the DNA-binding motifs have a worse prognosis than missense mutations outside these motifs, we show that non-missense mutations have prognostic value similar to missense mutations in DNA-binding motifs. Nonetheless, specific missense mutants (codon 179 and R248W) seem to be associated with an even worse prognosis. These results, obtained on the largest series analyzed thus far, show that TP53 mutations identified by gene sequencing have an independent prognostic value in breast cancer and could have potential uses in clinical practice.",cancer
572,HIF1A overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in a cohort of 731 colorectal cancers.,"Tissue hypoxia commonly occurs in tumors. Hypoxia- inducible factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2, which are essential mediators of cellular response to hypoxia, regulate gene expression for tumor angiogenesis, glucose metabolism, and resistance to oxidative stress. Their key regulatory subunits, HIF1A (HIF-1alpha) and endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1; HIF-2alpha), are overexpressed and associated with patient prognosis in a variety of cancers. However, prognostic or molecular features of colon cancer with HIF expression remain uncertain. Among 731 colorectal cancers in two prospective cohort studies, 142 (19%) tumors showed HIF1A overexpression, and 322 (46%) showed EPAS1 overexpression by immunohistochemistry. HIF1A overexpression was significantly associated with higher colorectal cancer-specific mortality in Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank test, P < 0.0001), univariate Cox regression (hazard ratio = 1.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.37 to 2.47; P < 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.72; 95% confidence interval, 1.26 to 2.36; P = 0.0007) that adjusted for clinical and tumoral features, including microsatellite instability, TP53 (p53), PTGS2 (cyclooxygenase-2), CpG island methylator phenotype, and KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and LINE-1 methylation. In contrast, EPAS1 expression was not significantly associated with patient survival. In addition, HIF1A expression was independently associated with PTGS2 expression (P = 0.0035), CpG island methylator phenotype-high (P = 0.013), and LINE-1 hypomethylation (P = 0.017). EPAS1 expression was inversely associated with high tumor grade (P = 0.0017) and obesity (body mass index > or = 30 kg/m2) (P = 0.039). In conclusion, HIF1A expression is independently associated with poor prognosis in colorectal cancer, suggesting HIF1A as a biomarker with potentially important therapeutic implications.",cancer
2035,Gemcitabine promotes immune escape of pancreatic cancer by down regulating the soluble ULBP2 protein.,"Due to early onset of local invasion and distant metastasis, pancreatic cancer is the most lethal human malignant tumor, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 5%. As a effective chemotherapy drug for pancreatic cancer patients, gemcitabine is reported to inhibit cell proliferation as a nucleotide analog. In this study, we investigated the role of gemcitabine in immune regulation of pancreatic cancer. Our data showed that the level of soluble ULBP2 (sULBP2), a ligand of NKG2D receptor, decreased in the supernatants of pancreatic cancer cell lines when gemcitabine was added, and sULBP2 level correlated with NK92 cells cytotoxicity to pancreatic cancer cell lines. Importantly, our data showed that gemcitabine promoted PANC-1 cells and MIA PaCa-2 immune evasion by reducing ADAM10 expression, a metalloproteinase involved in sULBP2 shedding from cell membrane. Knockdown of ADAM10 clearly downregulated sULBP2 levels in the culture supernatants and cells became more susceptible to NK92 cytotoxicity. Serum samples and tumor samples were obtained from 45 patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Statistical analysis showed a significant correlation between the serum level of sULBP2 with ADAM10 expression in PDAC tissues. In conclusion, our data demostrated that gemcitabine inhibits ULBP2 ectodomain shedding through the suppression of ADAM10 and enhance NK cells cytotoxicity by NKG2D-ULBP2 interaction. The results extends our understanding of gemcitabine in the treatment of pancreatic cancer from cell proliferation inhibition to immune regulation.",nonCancer
1098,ROS1 amplification mediates resistance to gefitinib in glioblastoma cells.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive brain tumor in adults and remains incurable despite multimodal intensive treatment regimens. The majority of GBM tumors show a mutated or overexpressed EGFR, however, tumors treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) will inevitably recur highlighting the need to identify signalling pathways involved in GBM resistance to these drugs. To this end, we treated GBM cells that overexpress EGFR with increasing concentrations of gefitinib and isolated resistant clones. These resistant clones were subject to RNAseq and the expression of several genes was found to be upregulated. These genes are mainly tyrosine kinase receptors and include ROS1, DDR1 and PDGFRA and are known to control several downstream targets of EGFR. The upregulation of ROS1 and DDR1 was confirmed at the protein level by western blot. Treatment with a potent and highly specific pyrazole ROS1 inhibitor in ROS1 overexpressing clones led to a sensitization of these cells to low concentrations of gefitinib. Combined treatment with gefitinib and ROS1 inhibitor induces massive cell death by apoptosis following a prolonged S phase cell cycle arrest. Our current study led to the discovery of alternative pathways used by GBM cells to evade cell death following treatment with gefitinib and identifies new therapeutic targets to prevent GBM cell resistance to the drug.",cancer
1723,Improved method for quantitative analysis of the cyclotide kalata B1 in plasma and brain homogenate.,"This study provides a new method for quantifying the cyclotide kalata B1 in both plasma and brain homogenate. Cyclotides are ultra-stable peptides with three disulfide bonds that are interesting from a drug development perspective as they can be used as scaffolds. In this study we describe a new validated LC-MS/MS method with high sensitivity and specificity for kalata B1. The limit of quantification was 2 ng/mL in plasma and 5 ng/gmL in brain homogenate. The method was linear in the range 2 - 10 000 ng/mL for plasma and 5 - 2000 ng/g for brain. Liquid Chromatographic separation was performed on a HyPurity C18 column, 50 × 4.6 mm, 3 µm particle size. The method had inter- and intra-day precision and accuracy levels <15% and 12% respectively. Applying the method to in vivo plasma samples and brain homogenate samples from equilibrium dialysis yielded satisfying results and was able to describe the plasma pharmacokinetics and brain tissue binding of kalata B1. The described method is quick, reproducible and well suited to quantifying kalata B1 in biological matrices. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer

MEN 2 is caused predominantly by germ-line mutations of the RET proto-oncogene. This study aimed to clarify the genotype-phenotype correlation in MEN 2 patients in Japan in order to modify the clinical management according to the genotype. Constitutive DNA of 64 MEN 2 patients (48 kindreds) were searched for mutations at exons 10, 11, 13, 14 and 16 of the RET proto-oncogene using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP), direct sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. The clinical characteristics of the patients were obtained from a previous nationwide questionnaire survey. Overall, 62 (96.9%) out of 64 patients had a germ-line point mutation at the hot spots. MTC and pheochromocytoma occurred equally in every genotype except C630S. Specific genotype had a correlation between tumor size and age at the operation for MTC or extent of MTC, i.e. C618S developed late onset type of MTC as compared with that of C634R, C634Y and M918T. Small MTC in C634R may be less aggressive than those in C634Y and M918T. DNA testing has good clinical implications for the management of patients with MEN 2 and the timing and operative procedures of thyroidectomy can be modified according to the genotype.",cancer
496,BRCA1 is an essential mediator of vinorelbine-induced apoptosis in mesothelioma.,"Therapeutic options for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) are limited despite the increasing incidence globally. The vinca alkaloid vinorelbine exhibits clinical activity; however, to date, treatment optimization has not been achieved using biomarkers. BRCA1 regulates sensitivity to microtubule poisons; however, its role in regulating vinorelbine-induced apoptosis in mesothelioma is unknown. Here we demonstrate that BRCA1 plays an essential role in mediating vinorelbine-induced apoptosis, as evidenced by (1) the strong correlation between vinorelbine sensitivity and BRCA1 expression level; (2) induction of resistance to vinorelbine by BRCA1 using siRNA oligonucleotides; (3) dramatic down-regulation of BRCA1 following selection for vinorelbine resistance; and (4) the re-activation of vinorelbine-induced apoptosis following re-expression of BRCA1 in resistant cells. To determine whether loss of BRCA1 expression in mesothelioma was potentially relevant in vivo, BRCA1 immunohistochemistry was subsequently performed on 144 primary mesothelioma specimens. Loss of BRCA1 protein expression was identified in 38.9% of samples. Together, these data suggest that BRCA1 plays a critical role in mediating apoptosis by vinorelbine in mesothelioma, warranting its clinical evaluation as a predictive biomarker.",cancer

Insight into their genesis came from identification of mutations in the PATCHED gene (PTCH) in patients with the basal-cell nevus syndrome, a hereditary disease characterized by multiple BCCs and by developmental abnormalities. The binding of Sonic hedgehog (SHH) to its receptor, PTCH, is thought to prevent normal inhibition by PTCH of Smoothened (SMO), a seven-span transmembrane protein. According to this model, the inhibition of SMO signalling is relieved following mutational inactivation of PTCH in basal-cell nevus syndrome. We report here the identification of activating somatic missense mutations in the SMO gene itself in sporadic BCCs from three patients. Mutant SMO, unlike wild type, can cooperate with adenovirus E1A to transform rat embryonic fibroblast cells in culture. Furthermore, skin abnormalities similar to BCCs developed in transgenic murine skin overexpressing mutant SMO. These findings support the role of SMO as a signalling component of the SHH-receptor complex and provide direct evidence that mutated SMO can function as an oncogene in BCCs.",cancer
128,A systematic profile of clinical inhibitors responsive to EGFR somatic amino acid mutations in lung cancer: implication for the molecular mechanism of drug resistance and sensitivity.,"Human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has become a well-established target for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, a large number of somatic mutations in such protein have been observed to cause drug resistance or sensitivity during pathological progression, limiting the application of reversible EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy in NSCLC. In the current work, we describe an integration of in silico analysis and in vitro assay to profile six representative EGFR inhibitors against a panel of 71 observed somatic mutations in EGFR tyrosine kinase domain. In the procedure, the changes in interaction free energy of inhibitors with EGFR upon various mutations were calculated one by one using a rigorous computational scheme, which was preoptimized based on a set of structure-solved, affinity-known samples to improve its performance in characterizing the EGFR-inhibitor system. This method was later demonstrated to be effective in inferring drug response to the classical L858R and G719S mutations that confer constitutive activation for the EGFR kinase. It is found that the Staurosporine, a natural product isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces staurosporeus, exhibits selective inhibitory activity on the T790M and T790M/L858R mutants. This finding was subsequently solidified by in vitro kinase assay experiment; the inhibitory IC50 values of Staurosporine against wild-type, T790M and T790M/L858R mutant EGFR were measured to be 937, 12 and 3 nM, respectively.",cancer
90,Minimal residual disease levels assessed by NPM1 mutation-specific RQ-PCR provide important prognostic information in AML.,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1)-mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is recognized as a provisional entity in the World Health Organization 2008 classification of myeloid neoplasms, accounts for 30% of AML. We analyzed 1227 diagnostic and follow-up samples in 252 NPM1-mutated AML patients with 17 different NPM1 mutation-specific real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCR) assays. Paired diagnostic/relapse samples of 84 patients revealed stable NPM1 mutations in all cases, suggesting that they are pathogenetically early events and thus applicable for minimal residual disease detection. A total of 47 relapses were predictable because of an NPM1 mutation level (%NPM1/ABL1) increase of at least 1 log or in 15 cases because of NPM1 mutation levels not decreasing less than 3 log ranges. A high prognostic value of NPM1 levels was shown for 4 different intervals after therapy was initiated. Furthermore, thresholds of 0.1 and 0.01%NPM1/ABL1 during/after treatment discriminated between prognostic subgroups. Univariate analyses, including age, white blood cell count, blast count, CD34 positivity, FLT3 mutations status, FAB type, karyotype, NPM1 mutation type, and pretreatment NPM1 mutational level, showed that, besides NPM1 mutation level, only age and FLT3-LM mutation status were prognostically significant for EFS. Multivariate analysis, including age, FLT3-LM status, and NPM1 mutation level at different time points, demonstrated that NPM1 level was the most relevant prognostic factor during first-line treatment. Similar results were obtained in patients undergoing second-line chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation.",cancer
2191,Intralesional and Systemic Immunotherapy for Metastatic Melanoma.,"Immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment of metastatic melanoma and dramatically improved patient outcomes. Ipilimumab, an inhibitor of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), was the first immunotherapeutic agent to demonstrate improved survival in advanced melanoma. More recently, other immune checkpoint inhibitors, including the programmed death-1 (PD-1) inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab, have demonstrated efficacy in locally advanced unresectable and metastatic melanoma. In addition to systemically delivered immunotherapies, intralesional therapies such as talimogene laherparepvec (TVEC) play an important role in the treatment of locoregionally advanced and metastatic melanoma.|This review provides an overview of the mechanisms behind immune checkpoint inhibitors. Clinical evidence of their efficacy is presented and discussion of new patterns of response and associated immune related adverse events associated with immunotherapy are provided.|Treatment options for locally advanced and metastatic melanoma are expanding with new developments in immunotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors. The utility of these novel therapies in the adjuvant setting is currently being explored.

1365,[Gastrointestinal and hepatic diseases].,"Diet is considered an important triggering factor for gastrointestinal symptoms whose physiopathology includes not only measurable, inflammatory reactions, but also functional disorders, where no organic effects may be measured or demonstrated. Moreover, the prevalence of the perceived intolerance to certain foods ranges from 20-25% (within the general population) to 50-70% in diseases like irritable bowel syndrome. This intolerance has been observed particularly after the consumption of milk and dairy products, which are frequently considered as causative of gastrointestinal symptoms, thus limiting their ingestion. However, this behavior reduces the dietary sources of calcium and consequently may lead to malnutrition and bone decalcification, amongst other complications. The true dairy intolerance (intestinal lactase deficiency) explains most of the symptoms ensuing their consumption, but the frequency of such alteration on the different gastrointestinal diseases has not been determined. This review focuses on the most frequent gastrointestinal diseases and the existing evidence regarding the alterations and symptoms related to the consumption of milk or dairy products.",nonCancer
731,"Phase IIB trial of oral Midostaurin (PKC412), the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3) and multi-targeted kinase inhibitor, in patients with acute myeloid leukemia and high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome with either wild-type or mutated FLT3.","Mutations leading to constitutive activation of the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 receptor (FLT3) occur in blasts of 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Midostaurin (PKC412; N-benzoylstaurosporin) is a multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor, with demonstrated activity in patients with AML/myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with FLT3 mutations. Ninety-five patients with AML or MDS with either wild-type (n = 60) or mutated (n = 35) FLT3 were randomly assigned to receive oral midostaurin at 50 or 100 mg twice daily. The drug was discontinued in the absence of response at 2 months, disease progression, or unacceptable toxicity. Response was defined as complete response, partial response (PR), hematologic improvement, or reduction in peripheral blood or bone marrow blasts by ≥ 50% (BR). The rate of BR for the population in whom efficacy could be assessed (n = 92) was 71% in patients with FLT3-mutant and 42% in patients with FLT3 wild-type. One PR occurred in a patient with FLT3-mutant receiving the 100-mg dose regimen. Both doses were well-tolerated; there were no differences in toxicity or response rate according to the dose of midostaurin. These results suggest that midostaurin has hematologic activity in both patients with FLT3-mutant and wild-type. The degree of clinical activity observed supports additional studies that combine midostaurin and other agents such as chemotherapy especially in FLT3-mutant AML.",cancer
924,Aurora Kinase A expression predicts platinum-resistance and adverse outcome in high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma patients.,"High-Grade Serous Ovarian Carcinoma (HGSOC) is the predominant histotype of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), characterized by advanced stage at diagnosis, frequent TP53 mutation, rapid progression, and high responsiveness to platinum-based-chemotherapy. To date, standard first-line-chemotherapy in advanced EOC includes platinum salts and paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab. The major prognostic factor is the response duration from the end of the platinum-based treatment (platinum-free interval) and about 10-0 % of EOC patients bear a platinum-refractory disease or develop early resistance (platinum-free interval shorter than 6 months). On these bases, a careful selection of patients who could benefit from chemotherapy is recommended to avoid unnecessary side effects and for a better disease outcome. In this retrospective study, an immunohistochemical evaluation of Aurora Kinase A (AURKA) was performed on 41 cases of HGSOC according to platinum-status. Taking into account the number and intensity of AURKA positive cells we built a predictive score able to discriminate with high accuracy platinum-sensitive patients from platinum-resistant patients (p < 0.001). Furthermore, we observed that AURKA overexpression correlates to worse overall survival (p = 0.001; HR 0.14). We here suggest AURKA as new effective tool to predict the biological behavior of HGSOC. Particularly, our results indicate that AURKA has a role both as predictor of platinum-resistance and as prognostic factor, that deserves further investigation in prospective clinical trials. Indeed, in the era of personalized medicine, AURKA could assist the clinicians in selecting the best treatment and represent, at the same time, a promising new therapeutic target in EOC treatment.",cancer
225,FGFR3 mutational status and protein expression in patients with bladder cancer in a Jordanian population.,"Bladder cancer accounts for nearly 5% of all newly diagnosed cancers in Jordan, with a much higher frequency in males. Recent studies have shown that activating mutations in FGFR3 are the most common findings in non-invasive low grade bladder tumors. In this study, we, retrospectively, investigated a cohort of 121 bladder cancer patients with various grades and stages of the tumor for molecular changes in FGFR3. Overexpression of FGFR3 was observed in 49%, 34%, 15%, and 2% of pTa, pT1, pT2, and pT3 cases, respectively. Further, FGFR3 expression was positive in 45%, 26%, and 30% of G1, G2 and G3 cases, respectively. Mutational analysis of exons 7, 10 and 15 of FGFR3 identified four previously reported mutations, namely R248C (n=4; 10%), S249C (n=23; 59%), Y375C (n=7; 18%), G382R (n=4; 10%), and one novel mutation, G382E (n=1; 3%). Our results indicate that both mutations and overexpression of FGFR3 are correlated together, and are more prevalent in early stage (pTa and pT1) and low grade (G1 and G2) bladder tumors. Survival analysis showed no contribution of changes in FGFR3 on the patient's survival. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards model analysis of overall survival for the following variables: age, gender, stage and grade of tumor, and FGFR3 (expression and mutation) revealed that age, stage and grade of tumor are independent predictors of overall survival in patients with bladder cancer. Our work is the first to address the molecular status of FGFR3 in Jordanian patients with bladder cancer, and provides further support for FGFR3 as a key player in the initiation of bladder tumors.",cancer
521,"Afatinib, an Irreversible EGFR Family Inhibitor, Shows Activity Toward Pancreatic Cancer Cells, Alone and in Combination with Radiotherapy, Independent of KRAS Status.","Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is characterized by a high frequency of KRAS mutations and frequent deregulation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and other EGFR family members such as HER2/ErbB2. The EGFR inhibitor erlotinib is approved for treatment of pancreatic cancer, but has shown modest activity in most patients. Here we investigated the activity of afatinib, a second-generation irreversible pan-EGFR family kinase inhibitor, alone or in combination with ionizing radiation, toward pancreatic cancer cells. The influence of afatinib on cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, clonogenic survival, nuclear fragmentation, ploidy, and centrosome amplification following irradiation was determined. Expression and phosphorylation of HER receptors, Akt, DNA-PKcs, and ERK1/2 was characterized by Western blot analysis. Afatinib was growth-inhibitory for all three cell lines but cytotoxic only toward BxPC3 (KRAS (wt)) and Capan-2 (KRAS (mut)) cells, both of which express high levels of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 receptors. Afatinib increased the radiosensitivity of BxPC3 and Capan-2 cells, prevented the radio-induced phosphorylation of Akt, and induced mitotic catastrophe following irradiation. In comparison, Panc-1 cells (KRAS (mut)) expressing low levels of EGFR family receptors were resistant to afatinib-induced radiosensitization. These results must be confirmed in vivo. Afatinib showed cytotoxic and radiosensitizing effects toward a subset of pancreatic cancer cells which was closely correlated with expression of EGFR, HER2, and HER3 receptors, but not with KRAS status.",cancer
732,Molecular Alterations and Everolimus Efficacy in Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2-Overexpressing Metastatic Breast Cancers: Combined Exploratory Biomarker Analysis From BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3.,"Two recent phase III trials, BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 (Breast Cancer Trials of Oral Everolimus), evaluated the addition of everolimus to trastuzumab and chemotherapy in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-overexpressing advanced breast cancer. The current analysis aimed to identify biomarkers to predict the clinical efficacy of everolimus treatment. Archival tumor samples from patients in BOLERO-1 and BOLERO-3 were analyzed using next-generation sequencing, immunohistochemistry, and Sanger sequencing. Biomarker data were available for 549 patients. PIK3CA activating mutations and PTEN loss were reported in 30% and 16% of BOLERO-1 samples and in 32% and 12% of BOLERO-3 samples, respectively. PI3K pathway was hyperactive (PIK3CA mutations and/or PTEN loss and/or AKT1 mutation) in 47% of BOLERO-1 and 41% of BOLERO-3 samples. In both studies, differential progression-free survival (PFS) benefits of everolimus were consistently observed in patient subgroups defined by their PI3K pathway status. When analyzing combined data sets of both studies, everolimus was associated with a decreased hazard of progression in patients with PIK3CA mutations (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.45 to 1.00), PTEN loss (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.96), or hyperactive PI3K pathway (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48 to 0.93). Patients with wild-type PIK3CA (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.83 to 1.46), normal PTEN (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.80 to 1.26), or normal PI3K pathway activity (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.87 to 1.62) did not derive PFS benefit from everolimus. This analysis, although exploratory, suggests that patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive advanced breast cancer having tumors with PIK3CA mutations, PTEN loss, or hyperactive PI3K pathway could derive PFS benefit from everolimus.",cancer
2110,Francisella tularensis IglG Belongs to a Novel Family of PAAR-Like T6SS Proteins and Harbors a Unique N-terminal Extension Required for Virulence.,"The virulence of Francisella tularensis, the etiological agent of tularemia, relies on an atypical type VI secretion system (T6SS) encoded by a genomic island termed the Francisella Pathogenicity Island (FPI). While the importance of the FPI in F. tularensis virulence is clearly established, the precise role of most of the FPI-encoded proteins remains to be deciphered. In this study, using highly virulent F. tularensis strains and the closely related species F. novicida, IglG was characterized as a protein featuring a unique α-helical N-terminal extension and a domain of unknown function (DUF4280), present in more than 250 bacterial species. Three dimensional modeling of IglG and of the DUF4280 consensus protein sequence indicates that these proteins adopt a PAAR-like fold, suggesting they could cap the T6SS in a similar way as the recently described PAAR proteins. The newly identified PAAR-like motif is characterized by four conserved cysteine residues, also present in IglG, which may bind a metal atom. We demonstrate that IglG binds metal ions and that each individual cysteine is required for T6SS-dependent secretion of IglG and of the Hcp homologue, IglC and for the F. novicida intracellular life cycle. In contrast, the Francisella-specific N-terminal α-helical extension is not required for IglG secretion, but is critical for F. novicida virulence and for the interaction of IglG with another FPI-encoded protein, IglF. Altogether, our data suggest that IglG is a PAAR-like protein acting as a bi-modal protein that may connect the tip of the Francisella T6SS with a putative T6SS effector, IglF.",nonCancer
1395,Molecular Engineering of Mechanochromic Materials by Programmed C-H Arylation: Making a Counterpoint in Chromism Trend.,"The development of facile accesses for screening organic functional molecules through the C-H bond activation is a revolutionary trend in material research. The prediction of mechanochromism as well as mechanochromic trend of luminogens is an appealing, yet challenging puzzle. Here, we present the design strategy of mechanochromic luminogens on the basis of the dipole moment of donor-acceptor (D-A) molecules. For this purpose, a highly efficient route to 2,7-diaryl [1,2,4]triazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidines (2,7-diaryl TAPs) has been established through the programmed C-H arylation, which unlocks a great opportunity to rapidly assemble a library of fluorophores for the discovery of the mechanochromic regularity. The molecular dipole moment can be employed to explain and further predict the mechanochromic trend. The 2,7-diaryl TAPs with electron-donating groups (EDGs) on 2-aryl and electron-withdrawing groups (EWGs) on 7-aryl possess a relatively small dipole moment and exhibit a red-shifted mechanochromism. While the two aryls are interchanged, the resulting luminogens have a relatively large dipole moment and display a blue-shifted mechanochromism. Seven pairs of isomers with an opposite mechanochromic trend have been given as illustrative examples. The aryl-interchanged congeners with a bidirectional emission shift are structurally similar, which would provide an avenue for deeply understanding the mechanochromic mechanism.",nonCancer
829,Reversing melanoma cross-resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibitors by co-targeting the AKT/mTOR pathway.,"The sustained clinical activity of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib (PLX4032/RG7204) in patients with BRAF(V600) mutant melanoma is limited primarily by the development of acquired resistance leading to tumor progression. Clinical trials are in progress using MEK inhibitors following disease progression in patients receiving BRAF inhibitors. However, the PI3K/AKT pathway can also induce resistance to the inhibitors of MAPK pathway. The sensitivity to vemurafenib or the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 was tested in sensitive and resistant human melanoma cell lines exploring differences in activation-associated phosphorylation levels of major signaling molecules, leading to the testing of co-inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway genetically and pharmacologically. There was a high degree of cross-resistance to vemurafenib and AZD6244, except in two vemurafenib-resistant cell lines that acquired a secondary mutation in NRAS. In other cell lines, acquired resistance to both drugs was associated with persistence or increase in activity of AKT pathway. siRNA-mediated gene silencing and combination therapy with an AKT inhibitor or rapamycin partially or completely reversed the resistance. Primary and acquired resistance to vemurafenib in these in vitro models results in frequent cross resistance to MEK inhibitors, except when the resistance is the result of a secondary NRAS mutation. Resistance to BRAF or MEK inhibitors is associated with the induction or persistence of activity within the AKT pathway in the presence of these drugs. This resistance can be potentially reversed by the combination of a RAF or MEK inhibitor with an AKT or mTOR inhibitor. These combinations should be available for clinical testing in patients progressing on BRAF inhibitors.",cancer

Generally, activation of neutrophils in lesions depends on the interaction of Fcγ receptors (FcγRs) with immunoglobulin G antibodies in immune complexes. However, altered FcγR expression on neutrophils of patients with ACS is unknown. We aimed to evaluate changes in FcγR expression on neutrophils of patients with ACS.|We enrolled 106 patients who were divided into four groups: acute myocardial infarction (AMI), unstable angina (UA), stable angina, and normal coronary arteries. The expressions of FcγRI, FcγRII, and FcγRIII on neutrophils and related upstream ligand and downstream molecules were measured by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.|The expression of unbound FcγRI was significantly decreased in AMI and UA patients and that of unbound FcγRIII was significantly decreased in AMI patients, with no difference in the expression of unbound FcγRII among the four groups. In contrast, plasma levels of antioxidized LDL antibody, myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase-9, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin were significantly greater in AMI and UA than in stable angina and normal coronary arteries patients.|Unbound FcγRI and FcγRIII expression was decreased on neutrophils of patients with ACS, which reflects a potential role of disturbed FcγRI and FcγRIII expression in the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaque. Our findings may provide insight into the mechanism underlying culprit plaque-relevant activation of neutrophil FcγRs in ACS patients.",nonCancer

We present an extended follow-up analysis of the total population and in the BRAF(V600E) and BRAF(V600K) mutation subgroups. Patients older than 18 years, with treatment-naive metastatic melanoma and whose tumour tissue was positive for BRAF(V600) mutations were eligible. Patients also had to have a life expectancy of at least 3 months, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate haematological, hepatic, and renal function. Patients were randomly assigned by interactive voice recognition system to receive either vemurafenib (960 mg orally twice daily) or dacarbazine (1000 mg/m(2) of body surface area intravenously every 3 weeks). Coprimary endpoints were overall survival and progression-free survival, analysed in the intention-to-treat population (n=675), with data censored at crossover. A sensitivity analysis was done. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01006980. 675 eligible patients were enrolled from 104 centres in 12 countries between Jan 4, 2010, and Dec 16, 2010. 337 patients were randomly assigned to receive vemurafenib and 338 to receive dacarbazine. Median follow-up was 12·5 months (IQR 7·7-16·0) on vemurafenib and 9·5 months (3·1-14·7) on dacarbazine. 83 (25%) of the 338 patients initially randomly assigned to dacarbazine crossed over from dacarbazine to vemurafenib. Median overall survival was significantly longer in the vemurafenib group than in the dacarbazine group (13·6 months [95% CI 12·0-15·2] vs 9·7 months [7·9-12·8]; hazard ratio [HR] 0·70 [95% CI 0·57-0·87]; p=0·0008), as was median progression-free survival (6·9 months [95% CI 6·1-7·0] vs 1·6 months [1·6-2·1]; HR 0·38 [95% CI 0·32-0·46]; p<0·0001). For the 598 (91%) patients with BRAF(V600E) disease, median overall survival in the vemurafenib group was 13·3 months (95% CI 11·9-14·9) compared with 10·0 months (8·0-14·0) in the dacarbazine group (HR 0·75 [95% CI 0·60-0·93]; p=0·0085); median progression-free survival was 6·9 months (95% CI 6·2-7·0) and 1·6 months (1·6-2·1), respectively (HR 0·39 [95% CI 0·33-0·47]; p<0·0001). For the 57 (9%) patients with BRAF(V600K) disease, median overall survival in the vemurafenib group was 14·5 months (95% CI 11·2-not estimable) compared with 7·6 months (6·1-16·6) in the dacarbazine group (HR 0·43 [95% CI 0·21-0·90]; p=0·024); median progression-free survival was 5·9 months (95% CI 4·4-9·0) and 1·7 months (1·4-2·9), respectively (HR 0·30 [95% CI 0·16-0·56]; p<0·0001). The most frequent grade 3-4 events were cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (65 [19%] of 337 patients) and keratoacanthomas (34 [10%]), rash (30 [9%]), and abnormal liver function tests (38 [11%]) in the vemurafenib group and neutropenia (26 [9%] of 287 patients) in the dacarbazine group. Eight (2%) patients in the vemurafenib group and seven (2%) in the dacarbazine group had grade 5 events. Inhibition of BRAF with vemurafenib improves survival in patients with the most common BRAF(V600E) mutation and in patients with the less common BRAF(V600K) mutation.

2347,Intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B: A still little known diagnosis for organic causes of intestinal chronic constipation.,"Intestinal neuronal dysplasia type B (IND-B) is a controversial entity among the gastrointestinal neuromuscular disorders. It may occur alone or associated with other neuropathies, such as Hirschsprung's disease (HD). Chronic constipation is the most common clinical manifestation of patients. IND-B primarily affects young children and mimics HD, but has its own histopathologic features characterized mainly by hyperplasia of the submucosal nerve plexus. Thus, IND-B should be included in the differential diagnoses of organic causes of constipation. In recent years, an increasing number of cases of IND-B in adults have also been described, some presenting severe constipation since childhood and others with the onset of symptoms at adulthood. Despite the intense scientific research in the last decades, there are still knowledge gaps regarding definition, pathogenesis, diagnostic criteria and therapeutic possibilities for IND-B. However, in medical practice, we continue to encounter patients with severe constipation or intestinal obstruction who undergo to diagnostic investigation for HD and their rectal biopsies present hyperganglionosis in the submucosal nerve plexus and other features, consistent with the diagnosis of IND-B. This review critically discusses aspects related to the disease definitions, pathophysiology and genetics, epidemiology distribution, clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria and therapeutic possibilities of this still little-known organic cause of intestinal chronic constipation.",nonCancer
1730,The prevalence and genotypes of GBV-C and its associations with HIV infection among persons who inject drugs in Eastern Europe.,"We aimed to determine the rate of GBV-C viremia, seropositivity, and genotypes among people who inject drugs (PWID) and healthy volunteers in Estonia and to evaluate associations between GBV-C and sociodemographic factors, intravenous drug use, co-infections.|The study included 345 Caucasian PWID and 118 healthy volunteers. The presence of GBV-C RNA (viremia) was determined by reverse transcriptase-nested PCR in 5' long terminal repeat. PCR products were sequenced and genotyped by phylogenetic analysis. GBV-C seropositivity was determined by ELISA.|One third of PWID (114/345) and 6% (7/118) of healthy volunteers (OR = 7.8, 95% CI = 3.5-20.5, P < 0.001) were GBV-C viremic. In PWID group, 79% of sequences belonged to subtype 2a, 19% to subtype 2b, and two remained unclassified. In healthy volunteers, six out of seven sequences belonged to subtype 2a and one to subtype 2b. We found HIV+ PWID to have two times increased odds of being GBV-C viremic compared to HIV- PWID (62% vs 38%; OR = 2.13, 95% CI = 1.34-3.36, P = 0.001). In addition, odds of being GBV-C viremic decreased with increasing age (OR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.90-0.98, P = 0.001). HIV positivity remained associated with GBV-C viremia in multivariate analysis after adjustment for age (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.39-3.58, P = 0.001). GBV-C seropositivity was similar among PWID and healthy volunteers (2.3% vs 1.7%, respectively; OR = 1.4, 95% C =0.3-13.5, P = 1).|In an Eastern European country we demonstrated that GBV-C viremia is common among PWID, but uncommon among healthy volunteers, and GBV-C seropositivity is infrequent among both groups.

1238,Progressive low-grade oligodendrogliomas: response to temozolomide and correlation between genetic profile and O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase protein expression.,"Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) on chromosomes 1p and 19q has been associated with chemosensitivity and improved prognosis in patients with oligodendrogliomas. The DNA repair enzyme O6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) may induce resistance to DNA-alkylating agents. Recent studies demonstrated that temozolomide (TMZ), an oral alkylating agent, has efficacy in the treatment of patients with progressive, low-grade oligodendroglioma (LGO). However, to the authors' knowledge, limited data are available regarding the 1p/19q profile and its correlation with MGMT protein expression and response to treatment with DNA-alkylating drugs. Adult patients with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and/or clinical deterioration compatible with progressive LGO were eligible for the study if they were radiotherapy-naive. TMZ cycles were repeated every 28 days at a dose of 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 consecutive days. Clinical and MRI data were used to evaluate outcomes, and Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to assess the median time to tumor progression (TTP). The 1p/19q status was analyzed from paired tumor-blood DNA samples using polymerase chain reaction-based microsatellite analysis. MGMT protein expression was estimated semiquantitatively by immunohistochemistry using paraffin embedded tumor sections. There were 28 patients who received treatment, and the median time from diagnosis to tumor progression was 33.5 months. The median number of TMZ cycles per patient was 12.5. Marked clinical improvements were recorded in 15 patients (54%), and objective responses were recorded in 17 patients (61%). The median TTP was 31 months, and the progression-free survival rate was 70% at 24 months. Loss of chromosome 1p and low MGMT protein expression were associated with objective response (P < .003 and P < .04, respectively).

2252,Facial Nerve Monitoring During Parotidectomy:A Two-Center Retrospective Study.,"We present a retrospective two-center study series and discussion of the current literature to assess the benefits of facial nerve monitoring during parotidectomy.|From 2007 to 2012, 128 parotidectomies were performed in 125 patients. Of these, 47 procedures were performed without facial nerve monitoring (group 1) and 81 with facial nerve monitoring (group 2). The primary endpoint was the House-Brackmann classification at 1 month and 6 months. Facial palsy was determined when the House-Brackmann grade was 3 or higher.|In group 1, 15 facial palsies were noted; 8 were transient and 7 were definitive. In group 2, 19 facial palsies were noted; 12 were transient and 7 were definitive. At both one and six months after parotidectomy, the rate of facial palsy in reoperation cases was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2.|Facial nerve monitoring is a simple, effective adjunct method that is available to surgeons to assist with the functional preservation of the facial nerve during parotid surgery. Although it does not improve the facial prognosis in first-line surgery, it does improve the facial prognosis in reoperations.",nonCancer
971,Cyclin-dependent kinase 2 is an ideal target for ovary tumors with elevated cyclin E1 expression.,"CCNE1 gene amplification is present in 15-20% ovary tumor specimens. Here, we showed that Cyclin E1 (CCNE1) was overexpressed in 30% of established ovarian cancer cell lines. We also showed that CCNE1 was stained positive in over 40% of primary ovary tumor specimens regardless of their histological types while CCNE1 staining was either negative or low in normal ovary and benign ovary tumor tissues. However, the status of CCNE1 overexpression was not associated with the tumorigenic potential of ovarian cancer cell lines and also did not correlate with pathological grades of ovary tumor specimens. Subsequent experiments with CCNE1 siRNAs showed that knockdown of CCNE1 reduced cell growth only in cells with inherent CCNE1 overexpression, indicating that these cells may have developed an addiction to CCNE1 for growth/survival. As CCNE1 is a regulatory factor of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2), we investigated the effect of Cdk2 inhibitor on ovary tumorigenecity. Ovarian cancer cells with elevated CCNE1 expression were 40 times more sensitive to Cdk2 inhibitorSNS-032 than those without inherent CCNE1 overexpression. Moreover, SNS-032 greatly prolonged the survival of mice bearing ovary tumors with inherent CCNE1 overexpression. This study suggests that ovary tumors with elevated CCNE1 expression may be staged for Cdk2-targeted therapy.",cancer
728,Two novel ALK mutations mediate acquired resistance to the next-generation ALK inhibitor alectinib.,"The first-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib is a standard therapy for patients with ALK-rearranged non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several next-generation ALK-TKIs have entered the clinic and have shown promising activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. As patients still relapse even on these next-generation ALK-TKIs, we examined mechanisms of resistance to the next-generation ALK-TKI alectinib and potential strategies to overcome this resistance. We established a cell line model of alectinib resistance, and analyzed a resistant tumor specimen from a patient who had relapsed on alectinib. We developed Ba/F3 models harboring alectinib-resistant ALK mutations and evaluated the potency of other next-generation ALK-TKIs in these models. We tested the antitumor activity of the next-generation ALK-TKI ceritinib in the patient with acquired resistance to alectinib. To elucidate structure-activity relationships of ALK mutations, we performed computational thermodynamic simulation with MP-CAFEE. We identified a novel V1180L gatekeeper mutation from the cell line model and a second novel I1171T mutation from the patient who developed resistance to alectinib. Both ALK mutations conferred resistance to alectinib as well as to crizotinib, but were sensitive to ceritinib and other next-generation ALK-TKIs. Treatment of the patient with ceritinib led to a marked response. Thermodynamics simulation suggests that both mutations lead to distinct structural alterations that decrease the binding affinity with alectinib. We have identified two novel ALK mutations arising after alectinib exposure that are sensitive to other next-generation ALK-TKIs. The ability of ceritinib to overcome alectinib-resistance mutations suggests a potential role for sequential therapy with multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs.",cancer
1523,nifDK clusters located on the chromosome and megaplasmid of Bradyrhizobium sp. DOA9 contribute differently to nitrogenase activity during symbiosis and free-living growth.,"Bradyrhizobium sp. strain DOA9 contains two copies of the nifDK genes, nifDKc, located on the chromosome, and nifDKp, located on a symbiotic megaplasmid. Unlike most rhizobia, this bacterium displays nitrogenase activity under both free-living and symbiotic conditions. Transcriptional analysis using gusA reporter strains showed that both nifDK operons were highly expressed under symbiosis, whereas nifDKc was the most abundantly expressed under free-living conditions. During free-living growth, the nifDKp mutation did not affect nitrogenase activity, whereas nitrogenase activity was drastically reduced with the nifDKc mutant. This led us to suppose that nifDKc is the main contributor of nitrogenase activity in the free-living state. In contrast, during symbiosis, no effect of the nifDKc mutation was observed and the nitrogen fixation efficiency of plants inoculated with the nifDKp mutant was reduced. This suggests that nifDKp plays the main role in nitrogenase enzyme activity during symbiosis. Together, these data suggest that the Bradyrhizobium sp. strain DOA9 contains two functional copies of nifDK genes that are regulated differently and that, depending on their lifestyle, contribute differently to nitrogenase activity.",nonCancer
469,Gene expression profiling identifies EPHB4 as a potential predictive biomarker in colorectal cancer patients treated with bevacizumab.,"The anti-VEGF monoclonal antibody bevacizumab was approved in 2004 as a first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in combination with chemotherapy and provided proof of principle for antiangiogenic therapy. However, there is no biomarker that can help to select patients who may benefit from bevacizumab in order to improve cost-effectiveness and therapeutic outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare gene expression profiles in CRC patients treated with bevacizumab who responded to the treatment with those that did not respond, in an effort to identify potential predictive biomarkers. RNA isolated from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumor specimens of patients treated with bevacizumab was subjected to gene expression analysis with quantitative RT-PCR arrays profiling 84 genes implicated in the angiogenic process. Data were validated at the protein level using immunohistochemistry. We identified a gene, EPHB4, whose expression was significantly increased in nonresponders (p = 0.048, Mann-Whitney test). Furthermore, high EPHB4 tumor levels were associated with decreased median overall survival (16 months vs 48, Log-rank p = 0.012). This was not observed in a control group of CRC patients treated only with chemotherapy, suggesting that EPHB4 constitutes a potential predictive biomarker and not a mere prognostic one. These data support the notion of a potential synergy between EPHB4-EFNB2 and VEGF-VEGFR pathways, making patients with high EPHB4 expression more resistant to VEGF blocking. Therefore, determination of EPHB4 levels in CRC samples could be useful for the prediction of response to bevacizumab.",cancer
1013,"Effects of UGT1A1 genotype on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicities of belinostat administered by 48-hour continuous infusion in patients with cancer.","The histone deacetylase inhibitor belinostat is eliminated through glucuronidation by UGT1A1. Polymorphisms that reduce UGT1A1 function could result in increased belinostat exposure and toxicities. We wanted to determine which single-nucleotide polymorphisms alter belinostat exposure and toxicity. In a phase 1 trial (belinostat over 48 hours in combination with cisplatin and etoposide), belinostat (400, 500, 600, or 800 mg/m(2) /24 h, 48-hour continuous infusion) was administered to patients with cancer in combination with cisplatin and etoposide (n = 25). Patients were genotyped for UGT1A1 variants associated with reduced function: UGT1A1*6, UGT1A1*28, and UGT1A1*60. End points were associations between UGT1A1 genotype and belinostat pharmacokinetics (PK), toxicities, and global protein lysine acetylation (AcK). Belinostat AUC was increased (P = .003), and t1/2 increased (P = .0009) in UGT1A1*28 and UGT1A1*60 carriers who received more than 400 mg/m(2) /24 h. The incidence of grades 3-4 thrombocytopenia (P = .0081) was associated with UGT1A1 polymorphisms. The US Food and Drug Administration-approved package insert recommends dose adjustment of belinostat for UGT1A1*28. However, our data suggest dose adjustment is also necessary for UGT1A1*60. UGT1A1 polymorphisms were associated with increased systemic belinostat exposure, increased AcK, and increased incidence of toxicities, particularly at doses > 400 mg/m(2) /24 h.",cancer
593,Fusions of the SYT and SSX genes in synovial sarcoma.,"Synovial sarcomas are high grade spindle cell tumors that are divided into two major histologic subtypes, biphasic and monophasic, according to the respective presence or absence of a well-developed glandular epithelial component. They contain in essentially all cases a t(X;18) representing the fusion of SYT (at 18q11) with either SSX1 or SSX2 (both at Xp11). Neither SYT, nor the SSX proteins contain DNA-binding domains. Instead, they appear to be transcriptional regulators whose actions are mediated primarily through protein-protein interactions, with BRM in the case of SYT, and with Polycomb group repressors in the case of SSX. Ongoing work on the SYT-SSX fusion and synovial sarcoma should yield a variety of data of broader biological interest, in areas such as BRM and Polycomb group function and dysfunction, transcriptional targets of SYT-SSX proteins and their native counterparts, differential gene regulation by SYT-SSX1 and SYT-SSX2, control of glandular morphogenesis, among others.",cancer

We explored the therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting ALK in such tumors in an early-phase clinical trial of crizotinib (PF-02341066), an orally available small-molecule inhibitor of the ALK tyrosine kinase. After screening tumor samples from approximately 1500 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer for the presence of ALK rearrangements, we identified 82 patients with advanced ALK-positive disease who were eligible for the clinical trial. Most of the patients had received previous treatment. These patients were enrolled in an expanded cohort study instituted after phase 1 dose escalation had established a recommended crizotinib dose of 250 mg twice daily in 28-day cycles. Patients were assessed for adverse events and response to therapy. Patients with ALK rearrangements tended to be younger than those without the rearrangements, and most of the patients had little or no exposure to tobacco and had adenocarcinomas. At a mean treatment duration of 6.4 months, the overall response rate was 57% (47 of 82 patients, with 46 confirmed partial responses and 1 confirmed complete response); 27 patients (33%) had stable disease. A total of 63 of 82 patients (77%) were continuing to receive crizotinib at the time of data cutoff, and the estimated probability of 6-month progression-free survival was 72%, with no median for the study reached. The drug resulted in grade 1 or 2 (mild) gastrointestinal side effects. The inhibition of ALK in lung tumors with the ALK rearrangement resulted in tumor shrinkage or stable disease in most patients.

2288,Evaluation of outbreak response immunization in the control of pertussis using agent-based modeling.,"Pertussis control remains a challenge due to recently observed effects of waning immunity to acellular vaccine and suboptimal vaccine coverage. Multiple outbreaks have been reported in different ages worldwide. For certain outbreaks, public health authorities can launch an outbreak response immunization (ORI) campaign to control pertussis spread. We investigated effects of an outbreak response immunization targeting young adolescents in averting pertussis cases.|We developed an agent-based model for pertussis transmission representing disease mechanism, waning immunity, vaccination schedule and pathogen transmission in a spatially-explicit 500,000-person contact network representing a typical Canadian Public Health district. Parameters were derived from literature and calibration. We used published cumulative incidence and dose-specific vaccine coverage to calibrate the model's epidemiological curves. We endogenized outbreak response by defining thresholds to trigger simulated immunization campaigns in the 10-14 age group offering 80% coverage. We ran paired simulations with and without outbreak response immunization and included those resulting in a single ORI within a 10-year span. We calculated the number of cases averted attributable to outbreak immunization campaign in all ages, in the 10-14 age group and in infants. The count of cases averted were tested using Mann-Whitney U test to determine statistical significance. Numbers needed to vaccinate during immunization campaign to prevent a single case in respective age groups were derived from the model. We varied adult vaccine coverage, waning immunity parameters, immunization campaign eligibility and tested stronger vaccination boosting effect in sensitivity analyses.|189 qualified paired-runs were analyzed. On average, ORI was triggered every 26 years. On a per-run basis, there were an average of 124, 243 and 429 pertussis cases averted across all age groups within 1, 3 and 10 years of a campaign, respectively. During the same time periods, 53, 96, and 163 cases were averted in the 10-14 age group, and 6, 11, 20 in infants under 1 (p < 0.001, all groups). Numbers needed to vaccinate ranged from 49 to 221, from 130 to 519 and from 1,031 to 4,903 for all ages, the 10-14 age group and for infants, respectively. Most sensitivity analyses resulted in minimal impact on a number of cases averted.|Our model generated 30 years of longitudinal data to evaluate effects of outbreak response immunization in a controlled study. Immunization campaign implemented as an outbreak response measure among adolescents may confer benefits across all ages accruing over a 10-year period. Our inference is dependent on having an outbreak of significant magnitude affecting predominantly the selected age and achieving a comprehensive vaccine coverage during the campaign. Economic evaluations and comparisons with other control measures can add to conclusions generated by our work.",nonCancer
1528,"A fluorescence study on the complexation of Sm(iii), Eu(iii) and Tb(iii) with tetraalkyldiglycolamides (TRDGA) in aqueous solution, in solid state, and in solvent extraction.","Tetraalkyldiglycolamide (TRDGA) ligands have potential utilization for the separation of actinide and lanthanide ions in the nuclear industry as chelates in aqueous solution if water-soluble or as extractants in organic solvents if water-insoluble. Here, a spectral titration method is extensively applied to investigating the complexation of fluorescent Sm(iii), Eu(iii), and Tb(iii) with TRDGA ligands in aqueous solutions and a solvent extraction system. In aqueous solutions using N,N,N',N'-tetramethyldiglycolamide (TMDGA, L(I)) as chelate, three successive complex species of Ln(iii), including [LnL(I)](3+), [LnL](3+), and [LnL](3+), are identified for each Ln(iii) (Ln = Sm, Eu, and Tb), and their stability constants are determined with fluorescence spectral titration method at 25 °C in 1 M NaNO3. The coordination mode in [LnL](3+) is illustrated by single-crystal structures of the solid compounds LnL(ClO4)3 (Ln = Sm, Eu, Tb, and L(I) = TMDGA) grown from aqueous solutions by slow evaporation. The crystal structures show that in the complexes Ln(iii) ions are coordinated by nine oxygen atoms from three tridentate L(I) ligands in a distorted tricapped trigonal prism geometry. To provide parallels to solvent extraction chemistry, the extracted Ln(iii) complexes with N,N'-dimethyl-N,N'-dioctyldiglycolamide (DMDODGA, L(II), a lipophilic analogue of TMDGA) are prepared, and the fluorescence spectra are collected as well for comparison. The fluorescence spectra of the extracted Ln(iii) complexes with L(II) in an organic phase of 40-60% (v/v) n-octanol-kerosene are nearly identical to the corresponding deconvoluted spectra of [LnL](3+) in aqueous solution. The similarity in fluorescence spectra suggests that Ln(iii) ion in the extracted complexes is also coordinated by three tridentate L(II) ligands and that the nitrate anions acting just as counterions do not directly bond to Ln(iii) in the organic phase of solvent extraction.",nonCancer
1851,The Importance of the Premedical Experience in Diversifying the Health Care Workforce.,"In light of national calls for increased diversity in medicine, it is critical for academic medicine to remain actively engaged in the conversation about the value of diversity in higher education, specifically for students from underrepresented backgrounds. Too often, the undergraduate premedical experience is excluded from conversations about diversity in medicine. The undergraduate premedical experience, however, is a critical junction for many students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine, especially for those who enter college underprepared for the academic rigor of the premedical experience.In this Commentary, the authors describe the data that currently exist about the premedical experience for underrepresented students. They posit that academic medicine needs to be involved in promoting success for undergraduate students from underrepresented backgrounds, especially given the known societal and educational benefits of a diverse physician workforce. The authors reference the University of Michigan Health Sciences Scholars Program (HSSP) as an example of a partnership between the medical school and the undergraduate campus. HSSP uses higher education best practices known to promote success for underprepared college students. Innovative collaborations between academic medicine and higher education such as HSSP have the potential to increase the diversity of students who are able to matriculate into the health professions. Finally, the authors review issues related to the programming needed to support success for these students.",nonCancer
2294,A resource-based game theoretical approach for the paradox of the plankton.,"The maintenance of species diversity is a central focus in ecology. It is not rare to observe more species than the number of limiting resources, especially in plankton communities. However, such high species diversity is hard to achieve in theory under the competitive exclusion principles, known as the plankton paradox. Previous studies often focus on the coexistence of predefined species and ignore the fact that species can evolve. We model multi-resource competitions using evolutionary games, where the number of species fluctuates under extinction and the appearance of new species. The interspecific and intraspecific competitions are captured by a dynamical payoff matrix, which has a size of the number of species. The competition strength (payoff entries) is obtained from comparing the capability of species in consuming resources, which can change over time. This allows for the robust coexistence of a large number of species, providing a possible solution to the plankton paradox.",nonCancer

Translocations involving the NPM gene cause cytoplasmic dislocation of the NPM protein. We used immunohistochemical methods to study the subcellular localization of NPM in bone marrow-biopsy specimens from 591 patients with primary acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). We then correlated the presence of cytoplasmic NPM with clinical and biologic features of the disease. Cytoplasmic NPM was detected in 208 (35.2 percent) of the 591 specimens from patients with primary AML but not in 135 secondary AML specimens or in 980 hematopoietic or extrahematopoietic neoplasms other than AML. It was associated with a wide spectrum of morphologic subtypes of the disease, a normal karyotype, and responsiveness to induction chemotherapy, but not with recurrent genetic abnormalities. There was a high frequency of FLT3 internal tandem duplications and absence of CD34 and CD133 in AML specimens with a normal karyotype and cytoplasmic dislocation of NPM, but not in those in which the protein was restricted to the nucleus. AML specimens with cytoplasmic NPM carried mutations of the NPM gene that were predicted to alter the protein at its C-terminal; this mutant gene caused cytoplasmic localization of NPM in transfected cells. Cytoplasmic NPM is a characteristic feature of a large subgroup of patients with AML who have a normal karyotype, NPM gene mutations, and responsiveness to induction chemotherapy.",cancer

An identical defect was created in the medial condyle of the contralateral stifle joint and left untreated as a control (empty defect, ED). The ewes were divided into 5 groups. Four sheep each were euthanized at 1, 2, 6, and 12 months from surgery, and 6 ewes were euthanized 24 months post-implantation. To study the effect of varying loads on the long-term regeneration process, an identical defect was also created and ESL cell engraftment performed in the lateral condyle (ESL-L) of the left stifle joint of the animals in the 12- and 24-month groups. The evaluation of regenerated tissue was performed by biomechanical, macroscopic, histological, immunohistochemical (collagen type II) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) assays.|no significant differences were found between treated and control sites in the biomechanical assays at any time point. ESL cell grafts showed significantly greater macroscopic evidence of regeneration as compared to controls at 24 months after surgery; significantly better histological evidence of repair in ESL-M samples versus controls was found throughout the considered period. At 24 months from surgery there was significantly improved integration of graft edges with the host tissue in the ESL-M as compared to the ESL-L samples, demonstrating that load bearing positively affects the long-term regeneration process.|ESL cells enhanced the regeneration of hyaline cartilage. FISH confirmed that the regenerative tissue originated from ESL cells.|ESL cells are able to self-renew for prolonged periods without differentiation and, most importantly, to differentiate into a large variety of tissues.",nonCancer

1219,Activating NOTCH1 mutations predict favorable early treatment response and long-term outcome in childhood precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Activating mutations of the transmembrane receptor NOTCH1 are common in precursor T-cell lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). We systematically analyzed the impact of activating NOTCH1 mutations on early treatment response and long-term outcome in 157 patients with T-ALL of the pediatric ALL-Berlin-Frankfurt-Munster (BFM) 2000 study. We confirm previous results that NOTCH1 mutations occur in more than 50% of T-ALL in children. In 82 patients (82/157; 52.2%), activating NOTCH1 mutations were identified either in the heterodimerization (55/82; 67.1%), in the PEST (13/82; 15.9%), or in both domains (14/82; 17.0%). The presence of NOTCH1 mutations was significantly correlated with a good prednisone response and favorable minimal residual disease (MRD) kinetics, which was independent from sex, age, white blood cell count, and T-cell immunophenotype at the time of diagnosis. Furthermore, activating NOTCH1 mutations specified a large subgroup of patients with an excellent prognosis. These findings indicate that in the context of the ALL-BFM 2000 treatment strategy, NOTCH1 mutations predict a more rapid early treatment response and a favorable long-term outcome in children with T-ALL.",cancer
804,Primary and secondary kinase genotypes correlate with the biological and clinical activity of sunitinib in imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor.,"Most gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) harbor mutant KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are imatinib targets. Sunitinib, which targets KIT, PDGFRs, and several other kinases, has demonstrated efficacy in patients with GIST after they experience imatinib failure. We evaluated the impact of primary and secondary kinase genotype on sunitinib activity. Tumor responses were assessed radiologically in a phase I/II trial of sunitinib in 97 patients with metastatic, imatinib-resistant/intolerant GIST. KIT/PDGFRA mutational status was determined for 78 patients by using tumor specimens obtained before and after prior imatinib therapy. Kinase mutants were biochemically profiled for sunitinib and imatinib sensitivity. Clinical benefit (partial response or stable disease for > or = 6 months) with sunitinib was observed for the three most common primary GIST genotypes: KIT exon 9 (58%), KIT exon 11 (34%), and wild-type KIT/PDGFRA (56%). Progression-free survival (PFS) was significantly longer for patients with primary KIT exon 9 mutations (P = .0005) or with a wild-type genotype (P = .0356) than for those with KIT exon 11 mutations. The same pattern was observed for overall survival (OS). PFS and OS were longer for patients with secondary KIT exon 13 or 14 mutations (which involve the KIT-adenosine triphosphate binding pocket) than for those with exon 17 or 18 mutations (which involve the KIT activation loop). Biochemical profiling studies confirmed the clinical results. The clinical activity of sunitinib after imatinib failure is significantly influenced by both primary and secondary mutations in the predominant pathogenic kinases, which has implications for optimization of the treatment of patients with GIST.",cancer
2175,Renal tubular epithelium-targeted peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ maintains the epithelial phenotype and antagonizes renal fibrogenesis.,"Accumulating evidence suggests that loss of the renal tubular epithelial phenotype plays an important role in the pathogenesis of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Systemic activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) has been shown to be protective against renal fibrosis, although the mechanisms are poorly understood. The present study aimed to define the role of renal tubular epithelium-targeted PPAR-γ in protection of the epithelial phenotype and the antagonism of renal fibrosis and to define the underlying mechanisms. In response to TGF-β1 challenge, PPAR-γ expression and activity in the renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTECs) were significantly reduced, and the reduction was accompanied by decreased E-cadherin and elevated α-SMA, indicating a loss of the epithelial phenotype. Oxidative stress induced by TGF-β1 was shown to be attributed to the alteration of the epithelial phenotype and PPAR-γ inhibition. Activation of PPAR-γ by its agonists of rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2 or genetic overexpression of PPAR-γ prevented the loss of the epithelial phenotype induced by TGF-β1 in line with the inhibition of oxidative stress. To explore the role of PPAR-γ in renal tubular epithelial in antagonizing fibrogenesis, PPAR-γ was specifically deleted from RPTECs in mice. Following unilateral ureteral obstruction, the fibrosis was markedly deteriorated in mice with PPAR-γ invalidation in RPTECs. Treatment with rosiglitazone attenuated tubulointerstitial fibrosis and epithelial phenotype transition in WT but not proximal tubule PPAR-γ KO mice. Taken together, these findings identified an important role of renal tubular epithelium-targeted PPAR-γ in maintaining the normal epithelial phenotype and opposing fibrogenesis, possibly via antagonizing oxidative stress.",nonCancer
2418,Spheres from cervical cancer cells display stemness and cancer drug resistance.,"Cervical cancer is one of the most common gynecological malignant tumors and is the cause of a serious health problem worldwide. An increasing amount of evidence has shown that cancer stem cells (CSCs) are present in tumors, and that these CSCs may be responsible for tumor metastasis and relapse. The present study aimed to identify and characterize a CSC population from the CaSki cell line. First, a stem cell culture medium was used to selectively expand the cancer stem-like cell spheres, and the putative stemness markers, Oct4 and Sox2, were identified. These markers were all highly expressed in the CaSki sphere-forming cells. Next, target region amplified polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction was performed and the CaSki sphere-forming cells were found to exhibit higher telomerase activity than the CaSki control cells cultured in non-stem cell medium. Using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium assay, it was found that the CaSki sphere-forming cells were more resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs than the control CaSki cells. Using the tumor invasive assay, it was shown that the CaSki sphere-forming cells were more invasive than the control CaSki cells. These characteristics all suggested that the tumor sphere-forming cells mirrored the acknowledged CSC phenotypes. Overall, the use of a suspended sphere culture of CaSki cells may be an easy and feasible approach for enriching cancer stem-like cells in cervical cancer research.",nonCancer

A total of 196 vitrified-warmed cleavage-stage embryos (from 49 patients, four sister embryos per patient) were used in the study, i.e., four sister embryos from each patient were randomly assigned to four groups: a control group of embryos that were not zona-manipulated (zona intact, group A); one experimental group of embryos in which a quarter of the zona pellucida was thinned using laser-assisted ZP thinning (group B); a second experimental group of embryos in which half of ZP was thinned (group C); and a third group in which two-thirds of the ZP was thinned (group D). Subsequent blastocyst development was assessed. Microscopy was performed to study the hatching process of the embryos after zona thinning. The blastocyst formation rates were 71.43% in group A, 67.35% in group B, 65.31% in group C, and 51.02% in group D (groups B-D vs. group A, P=0.661, P=0.515, P=0.038, respectively). The rates of complete hatching were 30.61% in group A, 38.78% in group B, 61.22% in group C, and 48.98% in group D (groups B-D vs. group A, P=0.396, P=0.002, P=0.063, respectively). For a subgroup of patients, there was a significant difference in the complete hatching in all the groups for women aged <35 years (P=0.011), and there was a significant difference in the complete hatching in all the groups for secondary infertility women (P=0.022). There was no significant difference in the blastocyst formation rates in the different groups of women aged ≥35 years (P=0.340). In addition, there was no significant difference in the complete hatching in the different groups among women aged ≥35 years (P=0.492). The results of the present study showed that in vitrified-warmed embryo transfers at the cleavage-stage, and the two-thirds zona pellucida thinning group demonstrated a significantly decreased blastocyst formation rate compared with the control group, while the half zona pellucida thinning group demonstrated a significantly increased complete hatching rate compared with the control group, which may have a high value in clinical application.",nonCancer
44,Loss of NF1 in cutaneous melanoma is associated with RAS activation and MEK dependence.,"Melanoma is a disease characterized by lesions that activate ERK. Although 70% of cutaneous melanomas harbor activating mutations in the BRAF and NRAS genes, the alterations that drive tumor progression in the remaining 30% are largely undefined. Vemurafenib, a selective inhibitor of RAF kinases, has clinical utility restricted to BRAF-mutant tumors. MEK inhibitors, which have shown clinical activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma, may be effective in other ERK pathway-dependent settings. Here, we investigated a panel of melanoma cell lines wild type for BRAF and NRAS to determine the genetic alteration driving their transformation and their dependence on ERK signaling in order to elucidate a candidate set for MEK inhibitor treatment. A cohort of the BRAF/RAS wild type cell lines with high levels of RAS-GTP had loss of NF1, a RAS GTPase activating protein. In these cell lines, the MEK inhibitor PD0325901 inhibited ERK phosphorylation, but also relieved feedback inhibition of RAS, resulting in induction of pMEK and a rapid rebound in ERK signaling. In contrast, the MEK inhibitor trametinib impaired the adaptive response of cells to ERK inhibition, leading to sustained suppression of ERK signaling and significant antitumor effects. Notably, alterations in NF1 frequently co-occurred with RAS and BRAF alterations in melanoma. In the setting of BRAF(V600E), NF1 loss abrogated negative feedback on RAS activation, resulting in elevated activation of RAS-GTP and resistance to RAF, but not MEK, inhibitors. We conclude that loss of NF1 is common in cutaneous melanoma and is associated with RAS activation, MEK-dependence, and resistance to RAF inhibition.",cancer
2012,A novel method for RNA extraction from FFPE samples reveals significant differences in biomarker expression between orthotopic and subcutaneous pancreatic cancer patient-derived xenografts.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) can identify and validate new biomarkers of cancer onset, progression and therapy resistance. Substantial archives of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) cancer samples from patients represent a rich resource for linking molecular signatures to clinical data. However, performing NGS on FFPE samples is limited by poor RNA purification methods. To address this hurdle, we developed an improved methodology for extracting high-quality RNA from FFPE samples. By briefly integrating a newly-designed micro-homogenizing (mH) tool with commercially available FFPE RNA extraction protocols, RNA recovery is increased by approximately 3-fold while maintaining standard A260/A280 ratios and RNA quality index (RQI) values. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the mH-purified FFPE RNAs are longer and of higher integrity. Previous studies have suggested that pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) gene expression signatures vary significantly under in vitro versus in vivo and in vivo subcutaneous versus orthotopic conditions. By using our improved mH-based method, we were able to preserve established expression patterns of KRas-dependency genes within these three unique microenvironments. Finally, expression analysis of novel biomarkers in KRas mutant PDAC samples revealed that PEAK1 decreases and MST1R increases by over 100-fold in orthotopic versus subcutaneous microenvironments. Interestingly, however, only PEAK1 levels remain elevated in orthotopically grown KRas wild-type PDAC cells. These results demonstrate the critical nature of the orthotopic tumor microenvironment when evaluating the clinical relevance of new biomarkers in cells or patient-derived samples. Furthermore, this new mH-based FFPE RNA extraction method has the potential to enhance and expand future FFPE-RNA-NGS cancer biomarker studies.",nonCancer
919,LRP1B deletion is associated with poor outcome for glioblastoma patients.,"Deletion of the tumor suppressor gene LRP1B has been reported in glioblastoma, the most aggressive primary brain tumor in adults. Our objective was to analyze frequency and prognostic impact of LRP1B deletion and expression levels. We retrospectively included all the primary IDH1/2 wild-type GBM patients with available clinical follow-up, DNA and RNA from our database. Deletions were analyzed by SNP-array. LRP1B mRNA expression was analyzed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. 178 patients were included with a median age of 62.36 years. LRP1B deletions were observed for 10.1% of patients (complete: 2.8%, partial: 7.3%). LRP1B deletions were associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS) (p=0.004) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.001). By multivariate analysis, LRP1B deletions remained significant for both PFS (p=0.003, hazard ratio (HR): 2.261) and OS (p=0.001, HR: 2.609). LRP1B was down expressed with a mean relative expression of 46% comparatively to normal tissue. No association between LRP1B mRNA and patient outcome was observed. No correlation was found between the deletions and the mRNA down-expression. These results were validated using GBM TCGA data. LRP1B presents with frequent molecular alterations which impact patient outcome, highlighting the potential interest of this gene for glioblastoma patients.",cancer
1563,Toward an implicit measure of emotions: ratings of abstract images reveal distinct emotional states.,"Although implicit tests of positive and negative affect exist, implicit measures of distinct emotional states are scarce. Three experiments examined whether a novel implicit emotion-assessment task, the rating of emotion expressed in abstract images, would reveal distinct emotional states. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to a sadness-inducing story inferred more sadness, and less happiness, in abstract images. In Experiment 2, an anger-provoking interaction increased anger ratings. In Experiment 3, compared to neutral images, spider images increased fear ratings in spider-fearful participants but not in controls. In each experiment, the implicit task indicated elevated levels of the target emotion and did not indicate elevated levels of non-target negative emotions; the task thus differentiated among emotional states of the same valence. Correlations also supported the convergent and discriminant validity of the implicit task. Supporting the possibility that heuristic processes underlie the ratings, group differences were stronger among those who responded relatively quickly.",nonCancer
2300,"Arktocara yakataga, a new fossil odontocete (Mammalia, Cetacea) from the Oligocene of Alaska and the antiquity of Platanistoidea.","The diversification of crown cetacean lineages (i.e., crown Odontoceti and crown Mysticeti) occurred throughout the Oligocene, but it remains an ongoing challenge to resolve the phylogenetic pattern of their origins, especially with respect to stem lineages. One extant monotypic lineage, Platanista gangetica (the Ganges and Indus river dolphin), is the sole surviving member of the broader group Platanistoidea, with many fossil relatives that range from Oligocene to Miocene in age. Curiously, the highly threatened Platanista is restricted today to freshwater river systems of South Asia, yet nearly all fossil platanistoids are known globally from marine rocks, suggesting a marine ancestry for this group. In recent years, studies on the phylogenetic relationships in Platanistoidea have reached a general consensus about the membership of different sub-clades and putative extinct groups, although the position of some platanistoid groups (e.g., Waipatiidae) has been contested. Here we describe a new genus and species of fossil platanistoid, Arktocara yakataga, gen. et sp. nov. from the Oligocene of Alaska, USA. The type and only known specimen was collected from the marine Poul Creek Formation, a unit known to include Oligocene strata, exposed in the Yakutat City and Borough of Southeast Alaska. In our phylogenetic analysis of stem and node-based Platanistoidea, Arktocara falls within the node-based sub-clade Allodelphinidae as the sister taxon to Allodelphis pratti. With a geochronologic age between ∼29-24 million years old, Arktocara is among the oldest crown Odontoceti, reinforcing the long-standing view that the diversification for crown lineages must have occurred no later than the early Oligocene.",nonCancer
1600,Succession of Alkane Conformational Motifs Bound within Hydrophobic Supramolecular Capsular Assemblies.,"n-Alkane encapsulation experiments within dimeric octa-acid cavitand capsules in water reveal a succession of packing motifs from extended, to helical, to hairpin, to spinning top structures with increasing chain length. Here, we report a molecular simulation study of alkane conformational preferences within these host-guest assemblies to uncover the factors stabilizing distinct conformers. The simulated alkane conformers follow the trends inferred from 1H-NMR experiments, while guest proton chemical shifts evaluated from Gauge Invariant Atomic Orbital calculations provide further evidence our simulations capture guest packing within these assemblies. Analysis of chain length and dihedral distributions indicates that packing under confinement to minimize non-polar guest and host interior contact with water largely drives the transitions. Mean intramolecular distance maps and transfer free energy differences suggest the extended and helical motifs are members of a larger family of linear guest structures, for which the guest gauche population increases with increasing chain length to accommodation the chains within the complex. Breaks observed between the helical/hairpin and hairpin/spinning top motifs, on the other hand, indicate the hairpin and spinning top conformations are distinct from the linear family. Our results represent the first bridging of empirical and simulation data for flexible guests encapsulated within confined nano-spaces, and constitute an effective strategy by which guest packing motifs within artificial or natural compartments can be rationalized and/or predicted a priori.",nonCancer
574,Hypoxia-inducible factor determines sensitivity to inhibitors of mTOR in kidney cancer.,"Inhibitors of the kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) have shown sporadic activity in cancer trials, leading to confusion about the appropriate clinical setting for their use. Here we show that loss of the Von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor gene (VHL) sensitizes kidney cancer cells to the mTOR inhibitor CCI-779 in vitro and in mouse models. Growth arrest caused by CCI-779 correlates with a block in translation of mRNA encoding hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF1A), and is rescued by expression of a VHL-resistant HIF1A cDNA lacking the 5' untranslated region. VHL-deficient tumors show increased uptake of the positron emission tomography (PET) tracer fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) in an mTOR-dependent manner. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for prospective, biomarker-driven clinical studies of mTOR inhibitors in kidney cancer and suggest that FDG-PET scans may have use as a pharmacodynamic marker in this setting.",cancer
1160,COT drives resistance to RAF inhibition through MAP kinase pathway reactivation.,"Oncogenic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase B-RAF (also known as BRAF) are found in 50-70% of malignant melanomas. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the B-RAF(V600E) mutation predicts a dependency on the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signalling cascade in melanoma-an observation that has been validated by the success of RAF and MEK inhibitors in clinical trials. However, clinical responses to targeted anticancer therapeutics are frequently confounded by de novo or acquired resistance. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative 'druggable' targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies. Here we expressed ∼600 kinase and kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to interrogate resistance to a selective RAF kinase inhibitor. We identified MAP3K8 (the gene encoding COT/Tpl2) as a MAPK pathway agonist that drives resistance to RAF inhibition in B-RAF(V600E) cell lines. COT activates ERK primarily through MEK-dependent mechanisms that do not require RAF signalling. Moreover, COT expression is associated with de novo resistance in B-RAF(V600E) cultured cell lines and acquired resistance in melanoma cells and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with MEK or RAF inhibitors. We further identify combinatorial MAPK pathway inhibition or targeting of COT kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing MAPK pathway activation in this setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the MAPK pathway and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",cancer

We present a cross-sectional analysis of 193 patients derived from their baseline clinical and functional assessments.|There is a high degree of variability in disease onset, pattern of weakness, and rate of progression. No factor, such as mutation class, protein expression, or age at onset, accounted for this variability. Among patients with clinical diagnoses of Miyoshi myopathy or limb-girdle muscular dystrophy, clinical presentation and examination was not strikingly different. Respiratory impairment and cardiac dysfunction were observed in a minority of patients. A substantial delay in diagnosis was previously common but has been steadily reducing, suggesting increasing awareness of dysferlinopathies.|These findings highlight crucial issues to be addressed for both optimizing clinical care and planning therapeutic trials in dysferlinopathy. This ongoing longitudinal study will provide an opportunity to further understand patterns and variability in disease progression and form the basis for trial design.",nonCancer
987,Chromosomes in Ewing's sarcoma. I. An evaluation of 85 cases of remarkable consistency of t(11;22)(q24;q12).,"Since our initial reports on chromosomal studies in eight Ewing's sarcomas (ES), we have carried out similar investigations on 23 additional ES specimens following short-term culture of tumor cells (16 cases), and established in vitro cell lines (three cases) and on xenografted tumors in nude mice (four cases). We demonstrated the presence of the reciprocal t(11;22)(q24;q12) in every case except one that exhibited a complex t(11;22;14)(q24;q12;q11). On the basis of results from these additional 23 cases, we confirm the consistency of the t(11;22)(q24;q12) in ES. Moreover, we reviewed 54 ES cases reported by other investigators; when added to our 31 cases, this brings the total number to 85 unrelated cases of ES available for an evaluation of the frequency of involvement of bands 11q24 and 22q12 in translocations in ES. The standard t(11;22)(q24;q12) proved to be a remarkably consistent event, present in 83% of the cases. Five percent of the cases exhibited complex translocations involving a third chromosome in addition to chromosomes #11 and #22. In 4% of the cases variant translocations involved 22q12 but with a chromosome(s) other than #11. The breakpoint on chromosome 22q12 appears to be the most consistently observed event in 92% of the cases, whereas, the breakpoint at chromosome 11q24 was observed in 88% of the cases.",cancer
2471,Alternative splicing of spleen tyrosine kinase differentially regulates colorectal cancer progression.,"Spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) has been reported as a potential tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the role of alternative splicing of SYK in carcinogenesis remains unclear. In the present study, SYK isoforms were overexpressed in the human CRC HCT 116 cell line using lentiviral expression vectors to investigate the biological functions of full length SYK [SYK(L)] and short form SYK [SYK(S)] in CRC. Real-time cellular analysis and the 5-ethynyl-2-deoxyuridine assay were used to detect the effects of SYK(L) and SYK(S) on cell proliferation. Cell cycle progression and migration were assessed via flow cytometry and Transwell assays, respectively. The results revealed that the recombinant lentivirus with SYK(L) overexpression significantly suppressed the proliferation and metastasis of CRC cells, while SYK(S) overexpression did not. In addition, MTS assays demonstrated that SYK(L) and SYK(S) increased the cellular sensitivity to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), suggesting that SYK(L) and 5-FU produce a significant synergistic effect on CRC cell proliferation, while SYK(S) has an effect on modulating CRC 5-FU sensitivity. Furthermore, quantitative polymerase chain reaction results revealed that SYK(L) was downregulated in 69% of 26 pairs of CRC and adjacent non-cancerous tissues, whereas SYK(S) exhibited no significant differences between tumor and normal tissues. Overall, the present data provides evidence that SYK(L) is a tumor suppressor in CRC, and both SYK(L) and SYK(S) may serve as important predictors in the chemotherapeutic treatment of CRC.",nonCancer

Twenty-five proven cases of VHLD occurring in four generations of a large kindred have been followed since 1964, and pheochromocytoma has occurred in 17. Symptoms of pheochromocytoma developed at an early age, on average at 12.5 +/- 1.3 yr, and definitive diagnosis and treatment of pheochromocytoma occurred at 19.9 +/- 2.6 yr. Significantly higher urine catecholamine concentrations were observed in younger patients than in older ones. Mutation analysis was performed in 14 family members, and a new mutation in the VHLD gene was identified in 11; this mutation is a G to T change at nucleotide 658 that results in the substitution of a serine for an alanine residue at position 149 of the polypeptide chain. Seven of the 11 patients with the mutation have VHLD; four, all 10 yr old or less, are asymptomatic and have no evidence of disease, but are at high risk for developing VHLD. These children are being followed closely for clinical and biochemical manifestations. The characterization of this new mutation has permitted identification of family members who are likely to develop VHLD.",cancer
199,A novel tankyrase small-molecule inhibitor suppresses APC mutation-driven colorectal tumor growth.,"Most colorectal cancers (CRC) are initiated by mutations of APC, leading to increased β-catenin-mediated signaling. However, continued requirement of Wnt/β-catenin signaling for tumor progression in the context of acquired KRAS and other mutations is less well-established. To attenuate Wnt/β-catenin signaling in tumors, we have developed potent and specific small-molecule tankyrase inhibitors, G007-LK and G244-LM, that reduce Wnt/β-catenin signaling by preventing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation-dependent AXIN degradation, thereby promoting β-catenin destabilization. We show that novel tankyrase inhibitors completely block ligand-driven Wnt/β-catenin signaling in cell culture and display approximately 50% inhibition of APC mutation-driven signaling in most CRC cell lines. It was previously unknown whether the level of AXIN protein stabilization by tankyrase inhibition is sufficient to impact tumor growth in the absence of normal APC activity. Compound G007-LK displays favorable pharmacokinetic properties and inhibits in vivo tumor growth in a subset of APC-mutant CRC xenograft models. In the xenograft model most sensitive to tankyrase inhibitor, COLO-320DM, G007-LK inhibits cell-cycle progression, reduces colony formation, and induces differentiation, suggesting that β-catenin-dependent maintenance of an undifferentiated state may be blocked by tankyrase inhibition. The full potential of the antitumor activity of G007-LK may be limited by intestinal toxicity associated with inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and cell proliferation in intestinal crypts. These results establish proof-of-concept antitumor efficacy for tankyrase inhibitors in APC-mutant CRC models and uncover potential diagnostic and safety concerns to be overcome as tankyrase inhibitors are advanced into the clinic.",cancer
780,Oncogenic CSF3R mutations in chronic neutrophilic leukemia and atypical CML.,"The molecular causes of many hematologic cancers remain unclear. Among these cancers are chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and atypical (BCR-ABL1-negative) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), both of which are diagnosed on the basis of neoplastic expansion of granulocytic cells and exclusion of genetic drivers that are known to occur in other myeloproliferative neoplasms and myeloproliferative-myelodysplastic overlap neoplasms. To identify potential genetic drivers in these disorders, we used an integrated approach of deep sequencing coupled with the screening of primary leukemia cells obtained from patients with CNL or atypical CML against panels of tyrosine kinase-specific small interfering RNAs or small-molecule kinase inhibitors. We validated candidate oncogenes using in vitro transformation assays, and drug sensitivities were validated with the use of assays of primary-cell colonies. We identified activating mutations in the gene encoding the receptor for colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3R) in 16 of 27 patients (59%) with CNL or atypical CML. These mutations segregate within two distinct regions of CSF3R and lead to preferential downstream kinase signaling through SRC family-TNK2 or JAK kinases and differential sensitivity to kinase inhibitors. A patient with CNL carrying a JAK-activating CSF3R mutation had marked clinical improvement after the administration of the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib. Mutations in CSF3R are common in patients with CNL or atypical CML and represent a potentially useful criterion for diagnosing these neoplasms.

They had a significantly greater right heart pressure by ECHO and mean pulmonary arterial pressure (MPAP) from right heart catheterization (RHC) than those with normal RV function. A reduced 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) did not predict RV dysfunction (OR 0.995; 95% CI 0.980-1.001, p = 0.138). In addition, worsening restrictive physiology, heart rate at one-minute recovery and desaturation were not different between patients with and without RV dysfunction. However, there were inverse correlations between 6MWD and MPAP from RHC (r = -0.41,  p = 0.010), 6MWD and RV systolic pressure (r = -0.51, p < 0.001), and 6MWD and MPAP measured by ECHO (r = -0.46, p =0.013). We also found no significant correlation between 6MWD and pulmonary function test parameters.|Our single-center cohort of patients with PH secondary to DPLD, PH was found to have an impact on 6MWD. In contrast to our expectations, 6MWD was not useful to predict RV dysfunction.

2358,Sensory sacrifices when we mass-produce mass produce.,"Plant breeders have been extremely successful at driving genetic improvements in crops. However, 'improvements' are truly a question of perspective. Over the last one-hundred years most plant genetic innovations have been driven by industry demand. Larger fruits, heavier yields, uniformity, increased resistance to disease and better shipping quality are just a few of the traits that have ensured profits on the farm and affordable food for consumers. However, these milestones have come at the expense of sensory qualities, which have been sacrificed in exchange for practical production objectives. With a base of industry-sufficient genetics, today's breeders can now turn to the consumer for guidance in defining critical desires. New approaches to plant breeding start with the analysis of consumer preferences, and then merge them with modern genomics and analytical chemistry tools. The result is the next generation of crops that meet supply chain demands while presenting improvements in flavor, nutrition, color, aroma and texture. This review analyzes the approach of consumer-assisted selection as it has been applied to tomato and strawberry, two complementary annual crops that have been intensively bred to meet industry expectations.

A case-case study was conducted in order to explore maternal and child exposures to tobacco smoking associations with early age leukaemia (EAL). Covariables of reference were MLL rearrangements (MLL-r), RASmut and NQO1 rs1800566 (C609T). Samples from 150 acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and 85 AML were included. Maternal exposures were assessed using a structured questionnaire with demographic, personal habits and residence history information. Restriction fragment length polymorphism and denaturing high performance liquid chromatography were used to screen FLT3, KRAS, and NRAS mutations; direct sequencing was performed to validate the results. NQO1 polymorphism was detected by real-time allelic discrimination technique. Overall, RASmut were detected in 28.7% of EAL cases; BRAFmut was found only in one AML patient. Higher rate of KRASmut was found in ALL (30.3%) compared to AML (20.8%) with MLL-r; RASmut showed an association with second-hand tobacco smoking exposures (OR, 3.06, 95% CI, 1.03-9.07). A considerable increased risk for EAL with the combination of RASmut and NQO1 609CT (OR, 4.24, 95% CI, 1.24-14.50) was observed. Our data demonstrated the increased risk association between maternal smoking and EAL with MLL-r.

2095,Human cytomegalovirus encoded chemokine receptor US28 activates the HIF-1α/PKM2 axis in glioblastoma cells.,"The human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) encoded chemokine receptor US28 promotes tumorigenesis through activation of various proliferative and angiogenic signaling pathways. Upon infection, US28 displays constitutive activity and signals in a G protein-dependent manner, hijacking the host's cellular machinery. In tumor cells, the hypoxia inducible factor-1α/pyruvate kinase M2 (HIF-1α/PKM2) axis plays an important role by supporting proliferation, angiogenesis and reprogramming of energy metabolism. In this study we show that US28 signaling results in activation of the HIF-1α/PKM2 feedforward loop in fibroblasts and glioblastoma cells. The constitutive activity of US28 increases HIF-1 protein stability through a Gαq-, CaMKII- and Akt/mTOR-dependent mechanism. Furthermore, we found that VEGF and lactate secretion are increased and HIF-1 target genes, glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), involved in glucose metabolism, are upregulated in US28 expressing cells. In addition, PKM2 is phosphorylated and found to be in a tumor-associated dimeric state upon US28 expression. Also in HCMV-infected cells HIF-1 activity is enhanced, which in part is US28-dependent. Finally, increased proliferation of cells expressing US28 is abolished upon inhibition of the HIF-1α/PKM2 cascade. These data highlight the importance of HIF-1α and PKM2 in US28-induced proliferation, angiogenesis and metabolic reprogramming.",nonCancer
1287,States of emergence: Writing African female same-sex sexuality.,"Tracing a series of intertextually linked short stories from the 1990s to the present by women writers from Nigeria and its diaspora-Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Unoma Azuah, Chinelo Okparanta, and Lola Shoneyin-I suggest that although the figure of the African lesbian appears ""new"" in the context of heightened contemporary attention to the issue of homosexuality, this figure has a literary history. Ghanaian Ama Ata Aidoo's novel Our Sister Killjoy: Or, Reflections From A Black-Eyed Squint (1977) inaugurates this formation, in which the imagining of female same-sex desire is entangled with articulating the experience of migration under the shadow of imperial histories. In these short stories, the emphasis on the difficulties of love in puritanical times and transnational places produces the figure of the African lesbian as a symbol of appealingly human vulnerability, resilience, and complexity.",nonCancer
1628,Risk factors influencing the outcome of peptic ulcer bleeding in chronic kidney disease after initial endoscopic hemostasis: A nationwide cohort study.,"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who had peptic ulcer bleeding (PUB) may have more adverse outcomes. This population-based cohort study aimed to identify risk factors that may influence the outcomes of patients with CKD and PUB after initial endoscopic hemostasis. Data from 1997 to 2008 were extracted from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. We included a cohort dataset of 1 million randomly selected individuals and a dataset of patients with CKD who were alive in 2008. A total of 18,646 patients with PUB were screened, and 1229 patients admitted for PUB after endoscopic hemostasis were recruited. The subjects were divided into non-CKD (n = 1045) and CKD groups (n = 184). We analyzed the risks of peptic ulcer rebleeding, sepsis events, and mortality among in-hospital patients, and after discharge. Results showed that the rebleeding rates associated with repeat endoscopic therapy (11.96% vs 6.32%, P = 0.0062), death rates (8.7%, vs 2.3%, P < 0.0001), hospitalization cost (US$ 5595±7200 vs US$2408 ± 4703, P < 0.0001), and length of hospital stay (19.6 ± 18.3 vs 11.2 ± 13.1, P < 0.0001) in the CKD group were higher than those in the non-CKD group. The death rate in the CKD group was also higher than that in the non-CKD group after discharge. The independent risk factor for rebleeding during hospitalization was age (odds ratio [OR], 1.02; P = 0.0063), whereas risk factors for death were CKD (OR, 2.37; P = 0.0222), shock (OR, 2.99; P = 0.0098), and endotracheal intubation (OR, 5.31; P < 0.0001). The hazard ratio of rebleeding risk for aspirin users after discharge over a 10-year follow-up period was 0.68 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.45-0.95, P = 0.0223). On the other hand, old age (P < 0.0001), CKD (P = 0.0090), diabetes (P = 0.0470), and congestive heart failure (P = 0.0013) were the independent risk factors for death after discharge. In-hospital patients with CKD and PUB after endoscopic therapy had higher recurrent bleeding, infection, and mortality rates, and the need for second endoscopic therapy. Age was the independent risk factor for recurrent bleeding during hospitalization. After being discharged with a 10-year follow-up period, nonaspirin user was a significant factor for recurrent bleeding.",nonCancer

1658,New-onset ventricular arrhythmias post radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation.,"As a new complication, new-onset ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) post atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation have not been well defined. This prospective study aimed to describe the details of new-onset VAs post AF ablation in a large study cohort.One thousand fifty-three consecutive patients who underwent the first radiofrequency catheter ablation for AF were enrolled. All patients had no evidence of pre-ablation VAs. New-onset VAs were defined as new-onset ventricular tachycardia (VT) or premature ventricular contractions (PVC) ≥1000/24 h within 1 month post ablation.There were 46 patients (4.4%) who had 62 different new-onset VAs, among whom 42 were PVC alone, and 4 were PVC coexisting with nonsustained VT. Multivariate analysis showed that increased serum leukocyte counts ≥50% post ablation were independently associated with new-onset VAs (OR: 1.9; 95% CI: 1.0-3.5; P = 0.043). The median number of PVC was 3161 (1001-27,407) times/24 h. Outflow tract VAs were recorded in 35 (76.1%) patients. No significant differences were found in origin of VAs (P = 0.187). VAs disappeared without any treatment in 6 patients (13.0%). No VAs-related adverse cardiac event occurred.The study revealed a noticeable prevalence but relatively benign prognosis of new-onset VAs post AF ablation. Increased serum leukocyte counts ≥50% post ablation appeared to be associated with new-onset VAs, implying that inflammatory response caused by ablation might be the mechanism.",nonCancer

2438,Association of FGD1 polymorphisms with early-onset breast cancer.,"Recent cancer studies have suggested that the faciogenital dysplasia 1 (FGD1) gene may play a role in the development of tumor cells. Somatic alterations in the FGD1 gene and increased Fgd1 protein expression have been observed in many breast tumor cases. The present study sequenced the FGD1 gene in tumor DNA from 46 breast cancer patients using Ion Torrent sequencing. Three synonymous polymorphisms and one missense polymorphism were detected with next-generation sequencing; however, no somatic mutations were observed. The Thr697 variant was identified in 18 patients with an average age at diagnosis of 55 years, which was a lower average age than patients without the polymorphism. In addition, a higher frequency of Thr697 was observed in African-American patients. The Pro712 was observed in 15 breast cancer patients with an average age of 58 years, and was observed as a haplotype with the Thr697 variant in 28% of the breast cancer patients studied. The missense polymorphism (Ala226Thr) was identified in a 40-year-old female patient who had a recurrence of cancer. These polymorphisms (Ala226Thr, Thr697 and Pro712) may be associated with an earlier onset of breast cancer.",nonCancer
955,Association of KRAS and EGFR mutations with survival in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas.,"Lung adenocarcinomas can be distinguished by identifying mutated driver oncogenes, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and KRAS. Mutations in EGFR are associated with both improved survival as well as response to treatment with erlotinib and gefitinib. However, the prognostic significance of KRAS has not been evaluated in large numbers of patients and remains controversial. For the current report, the authors examined the association of EGFR and KRAS mutations with survival among patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas. Data were analyzed from patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas who had known EGFR and KRAS mutation status evaluated between 2002 and 2009. The collected clinical variables included age, sex, Karnofsky performance status, smoking history, and treatment history. Overall survival from the diagnosis of advanced disease was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods. In total, 1036 patients were evaluated, including 610 women (59%) and 344 never-smokers (33%). The median patient age was 65 years (range, 25-92 years), and the majority of patients (81%) had a Karnofsky performance status ≥80%. In multivariate analysis, EGFR mutations were associated with longer overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.6; P < .001), and KRAS mutations were associated with shorter survival (hazard ratio, 1.21; P = .048). KRAS mutations predicted shorter survival for patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas. The presence of EGFR and KRAS mutations define distinct subsets of patients with lung adenocarcinomas and should be determined in patients when they are diagnosed with advanced disease. Clinical trial reports should include EGFR and KRAS mutation status along with other prognostic factors.",cancer

1507,Conversion of Non-Proliferating Astrocytes into Neurogenic Neural Stem Cells: Control by FGF2 and IFN-Gamma.,"Conversion of astrocytes to neurons, via de-differentiation to neural stem cells (NSC), may be a new approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases and brain injuries. The signaling factors affecting such a cell conversion are poorly understood, and they are hard to identify in complex disease models or conventional cell cultures. To address this question, we developed a serum-free, strictly controlled culture system of pure and homogeneous 'astrocytes generated form murine embryonic stem cells (ESC)'. These stem cell derived astrocytes (mAGES), as well as standard primary astrocytes resumed proliferation upon addition of FGF. The signaling of FGF receptor tyrosine kinase converted GFAP-positive mAGES to nestin-positive NSC. ERK phosphorylation was necessary, but not sufficient, for cell cycle re-entry, as EGF triggered no de-differentiation. The NSC obtained by de-differentiation of mAGES were similar to those obtained directly by differentiation of ESC, as evidenced by standard phenotyping, and also by transcriptome mapping, metabolic profiling, and by differentiation to neurons or astrocytes. The de-differentiation was negatively affected by inflammatory mediators, and in particular, interferon gamma (IFNγ) strongly impaired the formation of NSC from mAGES by a pathway involving phosphorylation of STAT1, but not the generation of nitric oxide. Thus, two antagonistic signaling pathways were identified here that affect fate conversion of astrocytes independent of genetic manipulation. The complex interplay of the respective signaling molecules that promote/inhibit astrocyte de-differentiation may explain why astrocytes do not readily form neural stem cells in most diseases. Increased knowledge of such factors may provide therapeutic opportunities to favor such conversions. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.",nonCancer

MATERIAL AND METHODS Eight-four patients with acute and subacute thoracolumbar fractures who were treated with SSPSF from January 2013 to June 2014 at the Changzhou Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Changzhou, China) were retrospectively reviewed. The patients were divided into 4 groups: the OPSF with 4 basic screws (OPSF-4) group, the OPSF with 4 basic and 2 additional screws (OPSF-6) group, the PPSF with 4 basic screws (PPSF-4) group, and the PPSF with 4 basic and 2 additional screws (PPSF-6) group. The intraoperative, immediate postoperative, and over 1-year follow-up outcomes were evaluated and compared among these groups. RESULTS Blood loss in the PPSF-4 group and the PPSF-6 group was significantly less than in the OPSF-4 group and the OPSF-6 group (P<0.05). The OPSF-6 group exhibited significantly higher immediate postoperative correction percentage of anterior column height of fractured vertebra than the other 3 groups (P<0.05), and higher correction of sagittal regional Cobb angle and kyphotic angle of injured vertebra than in the PPSF-4 and -6 groups (P<0.05). In addition, there was no significant difference in the correction loss of percentage of anterior column height, and loss of sagittal Cobb angle and kyphotic angle of fractured vertebrae at final follow-up among the 4 groups (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS OPSF with 6 screws had an advantage in the correction of injured vertebral height and kyphosis, and PPSF reduced the intraoperative blood loss of patients.",nonCancer

In our study, a wide variety of tumors underwent comprehensive genomic profiling for hundreds of known cancer genes using the FoundationOne™ or FoundationOne Heme™ comprehensive genomic profiling assays. BRAF fusions involving the intact in-frame BRAF kinase domain were observed in 55 (0.3%) of 20,573 tumors, across 12 distinct tumor types, including 20 novel BRAF fusions. These comprised 29 unique 5' fusion partners, of which 31% (9) were known and 69% (20) were novel. BRAF fusions included 3% (14/531) of melanomas; 2% (15/701) of gliomas; 1.0% (3/294) of thyroid cancers; 0.3% (3/1,062) pancreatic carcinomas; 0.2% (8/4,013) nonsmall-cell lung cancers and 0.2% (4/2,154) of colorectal cancers, and were enriched in pilocytic (30%) vs. nonpilocytic gliomas (1%; p < 0.0001), Spitzoid (75%) vs. nonSpitzoid melanomas (1%; p = 0.0001), acinar (67%) vs. nonacinar pancreatic cancers (<1%; p < 0.0001) and papillary (3%) vs. nonpapillary thyroid cancers (0%; p < 0.03).

1988,ZIF-8 Membranes via Interfacial Microfluidic Processing in Polymeric Hollow Fibers: Efficient Propylene Separation at Elevated Pressures.,"Propylene/propane (C3H6/C3H8) separations are performed on a large scale by energy-intensive distillation processes. Membranes based on metal-organic framework (MOF) molecular sieves, such as zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), offer the potential to perform these separations at considerably lower cost. However, the fabrication of scalable ZIF-8 membranes with high performance at elevated pressures and temperatures is challenging. We report the fabrication of high quality ZIF-8 hollow fiber membranes in engineered polymeric hollow fibers via the interfacial microfluidic membrane processing (IMMP) technique. Control of fiber microstructure, as well as optimization of IMMP conditions, allow us to achieve a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 180 (at 1 bar and 25˚C), which remains high (60) at 120˚C. Furthermore, high-pressure operation of these membranes was investigated. Detailed permeation measurements indicate excellent suppression of defects at higher pressures up to 9.5 bar, allowing a C3H6/C3H8 separation factor of 90 at 9.5 bar. The membranes also display a fourfold increase in flux at 9.5 bar compared to operation at 1 bar. The long-term stability of the ZIF-8 hollow fiber membranes is demonstrated by continuous operation over a month without loss of C3H6 permeance or selectivity.",nonCancer

Ph-negative clones were analyzed in 14 patients who developed clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in Ph-negative cells during treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI). Mutations were detected in 6/14 patients (43%) affecting the genes DNMT3A, EZH2, RUNX1, TET2, TP53, U2AF1 and ZRSR2. In two patients, the mutations were also found in corresponding Ph-positive diagnostic samples. To further investigate Ph-positive clones, 15 randomly selected CML patients at diagnosis were analyzed. Somatic mutations additional to BCR-ABL were found in 5/15 patients (33%) affecting ASXL1, DNMT3A, RUNX1 and TET2. Analysis of individual hematopoietic colonies at diagnosis revealed that most mutations were part of the Ph-positive clone. In contrast, deep sequencing of subsequent samples during TKI treatment revealed one DNMT3A mutation in Ph-negative cells that was also present in Ph-positive cells at diagnosis, implying that the mutation preceded the BCR-ABL rearrangement. In summary, BCR-ABL-independent gene mutations were frequently found in Ph-negative and Ph-positive clones of CML patients and may be considered as important cofactors in the clonal evolution of CML.",cancer
2313,The core clock gene Per1 phases molecular and electrical circadian rhythms in SCN neurons.,"The brain's biological clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), exhibits endogenous 24-hour rhythms in gene expression and spontaneous firing rate; however, the functional relationship between these neuronal rhythms is not fully understood. Here, we used a Per1::GFP transgenic mouse line that allows for the simultaneous quantification of molecular clock state and firing rate in SCN neurons to examine the relationship between these key components of the circadian clock. We find that there is a stable, phased relationship between E-box-driven clock gene expression and spontaneous firing rate in SCN neurons and that these relationships are independent of light input onto the system or of GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic activity. Importantly, the concordant phasing of gene and neural rhythms is disrupted in the absence of the homologous clock gene Per1, but persists in the absence of the core clock gene Per2. These results suggest that Per1 plays a unique, non-redundant role in phasing gene expression and firing rate rhythms in SCN neurons to increase the robustness of cellular timekeeping.",nonCancer
821,"NVP-BEZ235, a dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, prevents PI3K signaling and inhibits the growth of cancer cells with activating PI3K mutations.","Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) pathway deregulation is a common event in human cancer, either through inactivation of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 or activating mutations of p110-alpha. These hotspot mutations result in oncogenic activity of the enzyme and contribute to therapeutic resistance to the anti-HER2 antibody trastuzumab. The PI3K pathway is, therefore, an attractive target for cancer therapy. We have studied NVP-BEZ235, a dual inhibitor of the PI3K and the downstream mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). NVP-BEZ235 inhibited the activation of the downstream effectors Akt, S6 ribosomal protein, and 4EBP1 in breast cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity of NVP-BEZ235 was superior to the allosteric selective mTOR complex inhibitor everolimus in a panel of 21 cancer cell lines of different origin and mutation status. The described Akt activation due to mTOR inhibition was prevented by higher doses of NVP-BEZ235. NVP-BEZ235 reversed the hyperactivation of the PI3K/mTOR pathway caused by the oncogenic mutations of p110-alpha, E545K, and H1047R, and inhibited the proliferation of HER2-amplified BT474 cells exogenously expressing these mutations that render them resistant to trastuzumab. In trastuzumab-resistant BT474 H1047R breast cancer xenografts, NVP-BEZ235 inhibited PI3K signaling and had potent antitumor activity. In treated animals, there was complete inhibition of PI3K signaling in the skin at pharmacologically active doses, suggesting that skin may serve as surrogate tissue for pharmacodynamic studies. In summary, NVP-BEZ235 inhibits the PI3K/mTOR axis and results in antiproliferative and antitumoral activity in cancer cells with both wild-type and mutated p110-alpha.",cancer
2216,Small molecule-driven direct conversion of human pluripotent stem cells into functional osteoblasts.,"The abilities of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to proliferate without phenotypic alteration and to differentiate into tissue-specific progeny make them a promising cell source for regenerative medicine and development of physiologically relevant in vitro platforms. Despite this potential, efficient conversion of hPSCs into tissue-specific cells still remains a challenge. Herein, we report direct conversion of hPSCs into functional osteoblasts through the use of adenosine, a naturally occurring nucleoside in the human body. The hPSCs treated with adenosine not only expressed the molecular signatures of osteoblasts but also produced calcified bone matrix. Our findings show that the adenosine-mediated osteogenesis of hPSCs involved the adenosine A2bR. When implanted in vivo, using macroporous synthetic matrices, the human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-derived donor cells participated in the repair of critical-sized bone defects through the formation of neobone tissue without teratoma formation. The newly formed bone tissues exhibited various attributes of the native tissue, including vascularization and bone resorption. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adenosine-induced differentiation of hPSCs into functional osteoblasts and their subsequent use to regenerate bone tissues in vivo. This approach that uses a physiologically relevant single small molecule to generate hPSC-derived progenitor cells is highly appealing because of its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, scalability, and impact in cell manufacturing, all of which are decisive factors for successful translational applications of hPSCs.",nonCancer

A rat model of chronic HF was established by partially banding abdominal aorta and the cardiomyocytes were isolated with collagenase II. The cardiomyocytes were then transfected with adenovirus type 5-ADRβ2-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) for 48 h to observe the changes of β2-AR protein expression using western blot analysis. The IL-10 level was detected by ELISA. The experiment was divided into seven groups: Control, HF, HF+EGFP, HF+β2, sham, sham+EGFP and sham+β2 groups. Compared with the sham-operated group, left ventricular diastolic dimension, and left ventricular systolic dimension were increased (P<0.05), whereas ejection fraction and fractional shortening were decreased (P<0.05) in the HF group. Compared with the sham group, the cardiomyocyte survival rate of the HF group was significantly reduced (P<0.05). Compared with the control or sham group, the β2-AR protein level of the HF group showed no significant differences (P>0.05).

519,HER2YVMA drives rapid development of adenosquamous lung tumors in mice that are sensitive to BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination therapy.,"Mutations in the HER2 kinase domain have been identified in human clinical lung cancer specimens. Here we demonstrate that inducible expression of the most common HER2 mutant (HER2(YVMA)) in mouse lung epithelium causes invasive adenosquamous carcinomas restricted to proximal and distal bronchioles. Continuous expression of HER2(YVMA) is essential for tumor maintenance, suggesting a key role for HER2 in lung adenosquamous tumorigenesis. Preclinical studies assessing the in vivo effect of erlotinib, trastuzumab, BIBW2992, and/or rapamycin on HER2(YVMA) transgenic mice or H1781 xenografts with documented tumor burden revealed that the combination of BIBW2992 and rapamycin is the most effective treatment paradigm causing significant tumor shrinkage. Immunohistochemical analysis of lung tumors treated with BIBW2992 and rapamycin combination revealed decreased phosphorylation levels for proteins in both upstream and downstream arms of MAPK and Akt/mTOR signaling axes, indicating inhibition of these pathways. Based on these findings, clinical testing of the BIBW2992/rapamycin combination in non-small cell lung cancer patients with tumors expressing HER2 mutations is warranted.",cancer
1164,BRAF mutation-selective inhibition of thyroid cancer cells by the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 and genetic-potentiated synergism with the mTOR inhibitor temsirolimus.,"We examined the therapeutic potential of a novel MEK inhibitor, RDEA119, and its synergism with the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, in thyroid cancer cell lines. RDEA119 potently inhibited the proliferation of the 4 cell lines that harbored BRAF mutation but had no or modest effects on the other 4 cells that harbored wild-type BRAF (IC(50) of 0.034-0.217 μM vs. 1.413-34.120 μM). This inhibitory effect of RDEA119 in selected cell lines OCUT1 (BRAF V600E(+), PIK3CA H1047R(+)) and SW1376 (BRAF V600E(+)) was enhanced by combination with the mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus. The PTEN-deficient cell FTC133 was highly sensitive to temsirolimus but insensitive to RDEA119, and simultaneous treatment with the latter enhanced the sensitivity of the cell to the former. The KAT18 (wild-type) cell was not sensitive to either drug alone but became sensitive to the combination of the 2 drugs. The drug synergy was confirmed by combination index and isobologram analyses. RDEA119 and temsirolimus also showed synergistic effects on autophagic death of OCUT1 and KAT18 cells selectively tested. Dramatic synergistic effects of the 2 drugs were also seen on the growth of FTC133 xenograft tumors in nude mice. Overall, the effects of the 2 drugs on cell proliferation or autophagic death, either alone or in combination, were more pronounced in cells that harbored genetic alterations in the MAP kinase and PI3K/Akt pathways. Thus, these results demonstrated the important therapeutic potential of the novel MEK inhibitor RDEA119 and its synergism with temsirolimus in thyroid cancer.",cancer
620,"Neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (ExteNET): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial.","Neratinib, an irreversible tyrosine-kinase inhibitor of HER1, HER2, and HER4, has clinical activity in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of 12 months of neratinib after trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy in patients with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer. We did this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial at 495 centres in Europe, Asia, Australia, New Zealand, and North and South America. Eligible women (aged ≥18 years, or ≥20 years in Japan) had stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer and had completed neoadjuvant and adjuvant trastuzumab therapy up to 2 years before randomisation. Inclusion criteria were amended on Feb 25, 2010, to include patients with stage 2-3 HER2-positive breast cancer who had completed trastuzumab therapy up to 1 year previously. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive oral neratinib 240 mg per day or matching placebo. The randomisation sequence was generated with permuted blocks stratified by hormone receptor status (hormone receptor-positive [oestrogen or progesterone receptor-positive or both] vs hormone receptor-negative [oestrogen and progesterone receptor-negative]), nodal status (0, 1-3, or ≥4), and trastuzumab adjuvant regimen (sequentially vs concurrently with chemotherapy), then implemented centrally via an interactive voice and web-response system. Patients, investigators, and trial sponsors were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was invasive disease-free survival, as defined in the original protocol, at 2 years after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00878709. Between July 9, 2009, and Oct 24, 2011, we randomly assigned 2840 women to receive neratinib (n=1420) or placebo (n=1420). Median follow-up time was 24 months (IQR 20-25) in the neratinib group and 24 months (22-25) in the placebo group. At 2 year follow-up, 70 invasive disease-free survival events had occurred in patients in the neratinib group versus 109 events in those in the placebo group (stratified hazard ratio 0·67, 95% CI 0·50-0·91; p=0·0091). The 2-year invasive disease-free survival rate was 93·9% (95% CI 92·4-95·2) in the neratinib group and 91·6% (90·0-93·0) in the placebo group. The most common grade 3-4 adverse events in patients in the neratinib group were diarrhoea (grade 3, n=561 [40%] and grade 4, n=1 [<1%] vs grade 3, n=23 [2%] in the placebo group), vomiting (grade 3, n=47 [3%] vs n=5 [<1%]), and nausea (grade 3, n=26 [2%] vs n=2 [<1%]). QT prolongation occurred in 49 (3%) patients given neratinib and 93 (7%) patients given placebo, and decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (≥grade 2) in 19 (1%) and 15 (1%) patients, respectively. We recorded serious adverse events in 103 (7%) patients in the neratinib group and 85 (6%) patients in the placebo group. Seven (<1%) deaths (four patients in the neratinib group and three patients in the placebo group) unrelated to disease progression occurred after study drug discontinuation. The causes of death in the neratinib group were unknown (n=2), a second primary brain tumour (n=1), and acute myeloid leukaemia (n=1), and in the placebo group were a brain haemorrhage (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=1), and gastric cancer (n=1). None of the deaths were attributed to study treatment in either group. Neratinib for 12 months significantly improved 2-year invasive disease-free survival when given after chemotherapy and trastuzumab-based adjuvant therapy to women with HER2-positive breast cancer. Longer follow-up is needed to ensure that the improvement in breast cancer outcome is maintained. Wyeth, Pfizer, Puma Biotechnology.",cancer

Immunological parameters, including anti-aquaporin 4, antinuclear, anti-ribonucleoprotein, anti-SM, anti-SSA/Ro, anti-SSB/La and anti-ribosomal P-protein autoantibodies were examined.|The NMOSD group exhibited a significantly higher percentage of anti-aquaporin 4 antibodies compared with the control group (76.9 vs. 0.0%, p = 0). The positive rates for antinuclear and anti-SSA antibodies in the NMOSD group were also higher than in the control group (35.2 vs. 11.8%, p = 0.001; 13.0 vs. 0.0%, p = 0.044). In total, 36.1% of the patients in the NMOSD group were seropositive for autoantibodies but only 8.3% were diagnosed with definite systemic autoimmune disorders.|NMOSD is closely associated with elevated autoantibodies, particularly antinuclear and anti-SSA/Ro antibodies.

1678,"Fecal immunochemical test for colorectal cancer from a prospective cohort with 513,283 individuals: Providing detailed number needed to scope (NNS) before colonoscopy.","The fecal immunochemical test (FIT) is underutilized, in part, because its benefits have not been fully understood. We assessed the relationship of FIT values with cancer incidence and mortality, and explored how repeated administrations of FIT could aid clinicians. A cohort with 513,283 adults in Taiwan participated in a screening program between 1994 and the end of 2007. Colorectal cancer was identified from National Cancer Registry and not from colonoscopy. Positive FIT was FIT ≥ 100 ng/mL. Number needed to scope (NNS) to identify 1 cancer by different FIT values was calculated for the study time. Only 4% of subjects had FIT ≥ 100 ng/mL but contributed 40% of cancer cases, leading to a NNS of 25 for finding 1 in this group. However, within the same FIT ≥ 100 ng/mL, NNS was different by age: 10 for age 60 to 69 years, 42 for age 40 to 49 years, and 156 for age 20 to 39 years. Furthermore, within the same age, NNS was different by FIT values, for instance, 66 for FIT 100 to 199 ng/mL and 12 for FIT 600 to 799 ng/mL, a difference of 5-fold for age 50 to 59 years. The dose-response relationship of FIT can facilitate consultation regarding the need for colonoscopy by providing a quantitative NNS for cancer risk, an index easily understood by patients. Our conclusion made use of (a) age-dependent and (b) quantitative interpretation of FIT values. This single cutpoint practice obliterates a large amount of valuable cancer risk information available to patients.",nonCancer
2096,Increased hepatic FDG uptake on PET/CT in hepatic sinusoidal obstructive syndrome.,"Imaging features of sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS), an increasingly common drawback of chemotherapy, were evaluated via 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET/CT).|This retrospective study was approved by our Institutional Review Board, with a waiver of informed consent. FDG PET/CT studies of 35 patients (male, 24; female, 11; median age, 53.2 years) obtained between January, 2005 and December, 2012 were analyzed before and after systemic chemotherapy. Diagnosis of SOS was based on histologic (n=13) or gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (n=22) findings. On PET/CT images, ROIs drawn on non-tumorous liver generated mean standardized uptake value (SUVliver). Total lesion glycolysis of liver (TLGliver) was calculated as: SUVliver × CT-derived hepatic volume. Paired t-test was applied to compare changes before and after SOS.|Mean (±standard error [SE]) values of hepatic volume (baseline, 1307.7±46.2 cm3; SOS, 1395.4±41.3 cm3; p=0.004), SUVliver (baseline, 2.08±0.06; SOS, 2.27±0.07; p=0.02), and TLGliver (baseline, 2697.5±114.5; SOS, 3170.2±134.2; p=0.001) significantly increased with development of SOS. In contrast, mean SUVaorta was unchanged (baseline, 1.53±0.04; SOS, 1.50±0.04; p=0.52).|Hepatic FDG uptake on PET/CT intensified after onset of SOS and thus may be an inappropriate reference in this setting, potentially skewing chemotherapeutic responses gauged by lesion-to-liver SUV ratio.",nonCancer
1722,In-depth analysis of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in HIV-infected individuals failing first-line regimens in West and Central Africa.,"In resource-limited countries (RLC), antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been scaled up, but individual monitoring is still sub-optimal. Here we studied whether or not ART had an impact on the frequency and selection of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) under these settings. We also examined whether differences exist between HIV-1 genetic variants.|A total of 3,736 sequences from individuals failing standard first-line ART (n = 1,599, AZT/d4T+3TC+NVP/EFV) were analyzed and compared to sequences from reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI)-naïve individuals (n = 2,137) from 10 West and Central Africa countries.|Fisher exact tests and corrections for multiple comparisons were used to assess the significance of associations.|All RTI-DRM from the 2015-IAS list, except F227C, and nine mutations from other expert lists were observed to confer extensive resistance and cross-resistance. Five additional independently-selected mutations (I94L, L109I, V111L, T139R, T165L) were statistically associated with treatment. The proportion of sequences with multiple mutations, and the frequency of all TAMs, M184V, certain NNRTIS, I94L and L109I showed substantial increase with time on ART. Only one nucleoside and two non-nucleoside RTI-DRMs differed by subtype/CRF.|This study validates the global robustness of the actual DRM repertoire, in particular for CRF-02 predominating in West and Central Africa, despite our finding of five additional selected mutations. However, long-term ART without virological monitoring clearly leads to the accumulation of mutations and the emergence of additional variations, which limit drug options for treatment and can be transmitted. Improved monitoring and optimization of ART are necessary for the long-term effectiveness of ART.",nonCancer
1832,Synthesis of bi-dimensional Prussian blue analogue using an inverted Langmuir-Schaefer method.,"One of the aspects of modern materials science that has been captivating scientific interest for the last decade is low-dimensional systems. This stems from the fact that the physical, chemical, and biological properties of such systems are often vastly different from their bulk counterparts. Additionally, low-dimensionality structures frequently serve as a convenient platform for device applications. However, such materials are typically constructed from building blocks that are inherently three-dimensional, and so, from a morphological point of view, these can still be categorized as bulk powders or crystals. To push the boundaries of reduced dimensionality, we synthesized truly two-dimensional films of Prussian blue analogues (mixed valence tetracyanides) by combining an air-water interface reaction and a novel inverted Langmuir-Schaefer technique. The methodology introduced in this study offers control and tailoring over the Prussian blue analogues' film characteristics, which is an important step towards their incorporation into tangible applications. Standard isotherms were collected as a function of the initial reactant volume and a number of characterization techniques such as X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), UV-Visible Spectroscopy (UV-Vis), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) were performed on films transferred on various substrates. The results indicated a collection of single crystalline and polycrystalline flakes possessing different thicknesses and having a structural coherence length of 11 +/- 3 nm.",nonCancer

The aims of the present study were to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency and to identify clinical and epidemiological variables associated with vitamin D deficiency in an outpatient population with IBD.|Participants were recruited from nine hospitals in the southeastern and western regions of Norway as part of an observational, multicentre study from March 2013 to April 2014. Clinical and epidemiological data were collected by interview and from medical records. All analyses of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OH-D) were performed in the same laboratory.|In total, 49% (200/408) of the patients had a 25-OH-D concentration < 50 nmol/l, including 53% (122/230) of the Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 44% (78/178) of the ulcerative colitis (UC) patients. In CD patients, disease activity, measured as the HBI, was inversely associated with vitamin D deficiency. No such association was observed with the Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index (SCCAI) scores in UC, but in UC patients, vitamin D deficiency was associated with elevated faecal calprotectin > 100 mg/kg. In patients with CD, there were significantly more relapses during the previous year in patients with vitamin D deficiency.|Vitamin D deficiency was common, especially in CD, and was associated with increased disease activity, a relapsing disease course, and higher inflammatory activity.",nonCancer

However, its detection has increased due to the use of ultrasound fetal monitoring in the antenatal care program. In this article, we present the case of a pregnant 27-year-old diagnosed with an adnexal germ cell carcinoma at six weeks of gestation, whose initial approach was local resection (suboptimal cytoreduction). Four weeks after surgery, the patient presented with grade IV peripheral neuropathy in the lower limbs; magnetic resonance imaging scan indicated an infiltrative lesion at D5. The local medical board decided on chemotherapy starting on the 19th week of gestation.

349,Vandetanib as a potential new treatment for estrogen receptor-negative breast cancers.,"The receptor tyrosine kinase RET is implicated in the progression of luminal breast cancers (BC) but its role in estrogen receptor (ER) negative tumors is unknown. Here we investigated the expression of RET in breast cancer patients tumors and patient-derived xenografts (PDX) and evaluated the therapeutic potential of Vandetanib, a tyrosin kinase inhibitor with strong activity against RET, EGFR and VEGFR2, in ER negative breast cancer PDX. The RT-PCR analysis of RET expression in breast tumors of 446 patients and 57 PDX, showed elevated levels of RET in ER+ and HER2+ subtypes and in a small subgroup of triple-negative breast cancers (TNBC). The activity of Vandetanib was tested in vivo in three PDX models of TNBC and one model of HER2+ BC with different expression levels of RET and EGFR. Vandetanib induced tumor regression in PDX models with high expression of RET or EGFR. The effect was associated with inhibition of RET/EGFR phosphorylation and MAP kinase pathway and increased necrosis. In a PDX model with no expression of RET nor EGFR, Vandetanib slowed tumor growth without inducing tumor regression. In addition, treatment by Vandetanib decreased expression of murine Vegf receptors and the endothelial marker Cd31 in the four PDX models tested, suggesting inhibition of tumor vascularization. In summary, these preclinical results suggest that Vandetanib treatment could be useful for patients with ER negative breast cancers overexpressing Vandetanib's main targets.",cancer
279,Personalized oncogenomics: clinical experience with malignant peritoneal mesothelioma using whole genome sequencing.,"Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare and sometimes lethal malignancy that presents a clinical challenge for both diagnosis and management. Recent studies have led to a better understanding of the molecular biology of peritoneal mesothelioma. Translation of the emerging data into better treatments and outcome is needed. From two patients with peritoneal mesothelioma, we derived whole genome sequences, RNA expression profiles, and targeted deep sequencing data. Molecular data were made available for translation into a clinical treatment plan. Treatment responses and outcomes were later examined in the context of molecular findings. Molecular studies presented here provide the first reported whole genome sequences of peritoneal mesothelioma. Mutations in known mesothelioma-related genes NF2, CDKN2A, LATS2, amongst others, were identified. Activation of MET-related signaling pathways was demonstrated in both cases. A hypermutated phenotype was observed in one case (434 vs. 18 single nucleotide variants) and was associated with a favourable outcome despite sarcomatoid histology and multifocal disease. This study represents the first report of whole genome analyses of peritoneal mesothelioma, a key step in the understanding and treatment of this disease.",cancer
953,Mutational landscape of aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.,"Aggressive cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is often a disfiguring and lethal disease. Very little is currently known about the mutations that drive aggressive cSCC. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on 39 cases of aggressive cSCC to identify driver genes and novel therapeutic targets. Significantly, mutated genes were identified with MutSig or complementary methods developed to specifically identify candidate tumor suppressors based upon their inactivating mutation bias. Despite the very high-mutational background caused by UV exposure, 23 candidate drivers were identified, including the well-known cancer-associated genes TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, AJUBA, HRAS, CASP8, FAT1, and KMT2C (MLL3). Three novel candidate tumor suppressors with putative links to cancer or differentiation, NOTCH2, PARD3, and RASA1, were also identified as possible drivers in cSCC. KMT2C mutations were associated with poor outcome and increased bone invasion. The mutational spectrum of cSCC is similar to that of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and dominated by tumor-suppressor genes. These results improve the foundation for understanding this disease and should aid in identifying and treating aggressive cSCC.",cancer
1591,Outcomes of patients with ureteral obstruction who achieved stent-free state following balloon dilatation.,"The aim of this study was to assess the therapeutic role of ureteral stent removal following balloon dilatation (BD) in patients with a stent implanted for unilateral ureteral obstruction and with normal contralateral renal function.|This retrospective cohort study consisted of 37 consecutive patients with unilateral ureteral obstruction whose stents were removed after BD. All patients satisfied the following criteria: normal contralateral renal function, no evidence of malignancy, and the patient was eager to obtain a stent-free state (SFS) without invasive treatment. The relative function of the affected kidney and total renal function before and after stent removal were analyzed using renal scans and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). A successful outcome was defined as SFS without pain or febrile urinary tract infection plus maintenance of eGFR.|The mean age of all patients was 58.2 years. The mean follow-up periods before and after stent removals were 15.7 and 23.6 months, respectively. The most common underlying cause of ureteral obstruction was pelvic or abdominal surgery (51.4%). Of the 37 patients, 32 (86.5%) achieved successful SFS at last follow-up. Overall in the 37 patients, the eGFR (from 77.1 to 69.8 ml/min/1.73 m(2); p = 0.017) and relative renal function of the affected kidney (from 35.5 to 30.2%; p = 0.002) were significantly compromised.

962,Exome sequencing identifies recurrent somatic mutations in EIF1AX and SF3B1 in uveal melanoma with disomy 3.,"Gene expression profiles and chromosome 3 copy number divide uveal melanomas into two distinct classes correlating with prognosis. Using exome sequencing, we identified recurrent somatic mutations in EIF1AX and SF3B1, specifically occurring in uveal melanomas with disomy 3, which rarely metastasize. Targeted resequencing showed that 24 of 31 tumors with disomy 3 (77%) had mutations in either EIF1AX (15; 48%) or SF3B1 (9; 29%). Mutations were infrequent (2/35; 5.7%) in uveal melanomas with monosomy 3, which are associated with poor prognosis. Resequencing of 13 uveal melanomas with partial monosomy 3 identified 8 tumors with a mutation in either SF3B1 (7; 54%) or EIF1AX (1; 8%). All EIF1AX mutations caused in-frame changes affecting the N terminus of the protein, whereas 17 of 19 SF3B1 mutations encoded an alteration of Arg625. Resequencing of ten uveal melanomas with disomy 3 that developed metastases identified SF3B1 mutations in three tumors, none of which targeted Arg625.",cancer

Variant complex translocations have been observed in 5-8% of CML patients, in which a third chromosome other than (9;22) is involved. Imatinib mesylate is the first line breakpoint cluster region-Abelson gene (BCR/ABL)-targeted oral therapy for CML, and may produce a complete response in 70-80% of CML patients in the chronic phase. In the present study, a bone marrow sample was used for conventional cytogenetic analysis, and the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) test was used for BCR/ABL gene detection. A hematological analysis was also performed to determine the white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, packed and mean cell volumes, mean corpuscular hemoglobin, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration and platelet values of the patient. The hematological analysis of the patient indicated the increased WBC of 186.5×10(3) cells/µl, and decreased hemoglobin levels of 11.1 g/dl. The FISH test revealed that 67% cells demonstrated BCR/ABL gene translocation.

198,A novel tankyrase inhibitor decreases canonical Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells and reduces tumor growth in conditional APC mutant mice.,"Increased nuclear accumulation of β-catenin, a mediator of canonical Wnt signaling, is found in numerous tumors and is frequently associated with tumor progression and metastasis. Inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin signaling therefore is an attractive strategy for anticancer drugs. In this study, we have identified a novel small molecule inhibitor of the β-catenin signaling pathway, JW55, that functions via inhibition of the PARP domain of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 (TNKS1/2), regulators of the β-catenin destruction complex. Inhibition of TNKS1/2 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation activity by JW55 led to stabilization of AXIN2, a member of the β-catenin destruction complex, followed by increased degradation of β-catenin. In a dose-dependent manner, JW55 inhibited canonical Wnt signaling in colon carcinoma cells that contained mutations in either the APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) locus or in an allele of β-catenin. In addition, JW55 reduced XWnt8-induced axis duplication in Xenopus embryos and tamoxifen-induced polyposis formation in conditional APC mutant mice. Together, our findings provide a novel chemotype for targeting canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling through inhibiting the PARP domain of TNKS1/2.",cancer

Patients with unresectable locally advanced gastric cancer were performed EOX regimen or XELOX regimen at the discretion of the investigators. They were assessed for response every 2 cycles by CT (computed tomography) scan. A multidisciplinary team reassessed resectability after 4 cycles. The primary endpoint was the response rate. Secondary end points included the R0 resection rate, survival and adverse events.Results From November 2008 to May 2015, 242 patients were enrolled; 112 of them were assigned to EOX regimen and 130 to XELOX regimen. The response rates were 33.0% and 33.8% respectively in EOX group and XELOX group (P = 0.997). After 4 cycles of chemotherapy, 63 patients (56.3%) in EOX group and 81 patients (62.3%) in XELOX group received radical operation (P = 0.408). There was no significant difference in progress-free survival (PFS, 12.0m vs. 15.4m, P = 0.925) and overall survival (OS, 25.7m vs. 29.0m, P = 0.783) in two groups.

1673,Exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement has good sensitivity and specificity to detect lower extremity arterial stenosis assessed by computed tomography angiography.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a highly prevalent disease diagnosed by the use of ankle-brachial index (ABI) at rest. In some clinical conditions (diabetes, renal insufficiency, advanced age), ABI can be falsely normal and other tests are required for the PAD diagnosis (American Heart Association statement). This study was conducted to determine the accuracy of exercise transcutaneous oxygen pressure measurement (exercise-TcPo2) in detection of arterial stenosis ≥50% using computed tomography angiography (CTA) as the gold standard.We retrospectively analyzed consecutive patients referred to our vascular unit (University Hospital, Rennes, France) for exercise-TcPo2 testing from 2014 to 2015. All included patients had a CTA performed within 3 months of the exercise-TcPo2 test. Exercise-TcPo2 was performed on treadmill (10% slope; 2 mph speed). We calculated the Delta from Resting Oxygen Pressure (DROP) index (expressed in mm Hg) at the proximal and distal levels. Two blinded physicians performed stenosis quantification on CTA. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to define a cutoff point to detect arterial stenosis ≥50%, stenosis ≥60%, and stenosis ≥70%.A total of 34 patients (mean age 64 ± 2 years old; 74% men) were analyzed. The highest areas under the curve (AUC) were found for 60% stenosis at both proximal and distal levels. For stenosis ≥50%, sensitivity and specificity of proximal minimal DROP were 80.9% [67.1-89.7], 81.0% [59.3-92.7] respectively. For stenosis ≥50%, sensitivity and specificity of distal minimal DROP were 73.2% [60.3-83.1], 83.3% [53.8-96.2], respectively. For stenosis ≥60%, sensitivity and specificity of proximal minimal DROP were 82.5% [67.6-91.5] and 85.7% [67.7-94.8] respectively. For stenosis ≥60%, sensitivity and specificity of distal minimal DROP were 80.4% [67.3-89.1] and 88.2% [64.2-97.7], respectively. For stenosis ≥70%, sensitivity and specificity of proximal minimal DROP were 85.7% [67.7-94.8] and 75.0% [59.6-85.9] respectively. For stenosis ≥70%, sensitivity and specificity of distal minimal DROP were 86.0% [72.2-93.7] and 76.0% [56.1-88.7], respectively.Exercise-TcPo2 using a proximal minimal DROP value ≤-15 mm Hg or a distal minimal DROP value ≤-16 mm Hg is accurate to diagnose arterial stenosis especially stenosis ≥60% on the lower limbs.

797,Extended Antitumor Response of a BRAF V600E Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma to Vemurafenib.,"For patients with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) refractory to radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment, systemic chemotherapy has limited efficacy. Such tumors frequently harbor BRAF V600E, and this alteration may predict responsiveness to vemurafenib treatment. We report a metastatic PTC patient refractory to RAI treatment that underwent genomic profiling by next-generation sequencing. The sole genomic alteration identified was BRAF V600E on a near diploid genome with trisomy 1q. With vemurafenib treatment, the patient experienced a dramatic radiographic and clinical improvement, with the duration of an ongoing antitumor response exceeding 23 months. Hybridization capture of 3,769 exons of 236 cancer-related genes and the introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in cancer was applied to >50 ng of DNA extracted from a formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded biopsy of a lymph node containing metastatic PTC and was sequenced to a high, uniform coverage of ×616. A BRAF V600E alteration was identified with no other somatic genomic alterations present within a near diploid tumor genome. The patient initially received vemurafenib at 960 mg twice daily that was reduced to 480 mg twice daily due to rash and diarrhea and has experienced an ongoing antitumor response exceeding 23 months by both PET-CT and dedicated CT imaging. Genomic profiling in metastatic, RAI-refractory PTC can reveal a targetable BRAF V600E alteration without compounding somatic alterations, and such patients may derive a more prolonged benefit from vemurafenib treatment. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to confirm our preliminary observation.",cancer
906,Circadian regulation of mTOR by the ubiquitin pathway in renal cell carcinoma.,"Circadian clock systems regulate many biologic functions, including cell division and hormone secretion in mammals. In this study, we explored the effects of circadian control on the pivot cell growth regulatory mTOR, the activity of which is deregulated in tumor cells compared with normal cells. Specifically, we investigated whether the antitumor effect of an mTOR inhibitor could be improved by changing its dosing schedule in RenCa tumor-bearing mice. Active, phosphorylated mTOR displayed a 24-hour rhythm, and levels of total mTOR protein (but not mRNA) also showed a circadian rhythm in RenCa tumor masses. Through investigations of the oscillation mechanism for mTOR expression, we identified the ubiquitination factor Fbxw7 as an mTOR regulator that oscillated in its expression in a manner opposite from mTOR. Fbxw7 transcription was regulated by the circadian regulator D-site-binding protein. Notably, administration of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus during periods of elevated mTOR improved survival in tumor-bearing mice. Our findings demonstrate that the circadian oscillation of mTOR activity is regulated by circadian clock systems, which influence the antitumor effect of mTOR inhibitors.",cancer
855,Feedback suppression of PI3Kα signaling in PTEN-mutated tumors is relieved by selective inhibition of PI3Kβ.,"In PTEN-mutated tumors, we show that PI3Kα activity is suppressed and PI3K signaling is driven by PI3Kβ. A selective inhibitor of PI3Kβ inhibits the Akt/mTOR pathway in these tumors but not in those driven by receptor tyrosine kinases. However, inhibition of PI3Kβ only transiently inhibits Akt/mTOR signaling because it relieves feedback inhibition of IGF1R and other receptors and thus causes activation of PI3Kα and a rebound in downstream signaling. This rebound is suppressed and tumor growth inhibition enhanced with combined inhibition of PI3Kα and PI3Kβ. In PTEN-deficient models of prostate cancer, this effective inhibition of PI3K causes marked activation of androgen receptor activity. Combined inhibition of both PI3K isoforms and androgen receptor results in major tumor regressions.",cancer
1267,"Results of the Phase I Trial of RG7112, a Small-Molecule MDM2 Antagonist in Leukemia.","RG7112 is a small-molecule MDM2 antagonist. MDM2 is a negative regulator of the tumor suppressor p53 and frequently overexpressed in leukemias. Thus, a phase I study of RG7112 in patients with hematologic malignancies was conducted. Primary study objectives included determination of the dose and safety profile of RG7112. Secondary objectives included evaluation of pharmacokinetics; pharmacodynamics, such as TP53-mutation status and MDM2 expression; and preliminary clinical activity. Patients were divided into two cohorts: Stratum A [relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML; except acute promyelocytic leukemia), acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic myelogenous leukemia] and Stratum B (relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small cell lymphocytic leukemia; CLL/sCLL). Some Stratum A patients were treated at the MTD to assess clinical activity. RG7112 was administered to 116 patients (96 patients in Stratum A and 20 patients in Stratum B). All patients experienced at least 1 adverse event, and 3 dose-limiting toxicities were reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that twice-daily dosing enhanced daily exposure. Antileukemia activity was observed in the 30 patients with AML assessed at the MTD, including 5 patients who met International Working Group (IWG) criteria for response. Exploratory analysis revealed TP53 mutations in 14% of Stratum A patients and in 40% of Stratum B patients. Two patients with TP53 mutations exhibited clinical activity. p53 target genes were induced only in TP53 wild-type leukemic cells. Baseline expression levels of MDM2 correlated positively with clinical response. RG7112 demonstrated clinical activity against relapsed/refractory AML and CLL/sCLL. MDM2 inhibition resulted in p53 stabilization and transcriptional activation of p53-target genes. We provide proof-of-concept that MDM2 inhibition restores p53 function and generates clinical responses in hematologic malignancies.",cancer
1089,Activity of Selumetinib in Neurofibromatosis Type 1-Related Plexiform Neurofibromas.,"Background Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of neurofibromatosis type 1-related plexiform neurofibromas, which are characterized by elevated RAS-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. Methods We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886), an oral selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1-related neurofibroma. Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma. Results A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5) with a median tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib. Patients were able to receive selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended adult dose). The most common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash, gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The results of pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial were similar to those published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor volume decreases from baseline of ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume increase from baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed. Conclusions Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term dose-adjusted treatment with selumetinib without having excess toxic effects.

1518,A Streptavidin Binding Site Mutation Yields an Unexpected Result: An Ionized Asp128 Residue is Not Essential for Strong Biotin Binding.,"We report a detailed study for a point mutation of the crucial binding site residue, D128, in the biotin-streptavidin complex. The conservative substitution, D128N, preserves the detailed structure observed for the wild type complex but has only minimal impact on biotin binding, even though previous experimental and computational studies suggested that a charged D128 residues was crucial for high-affinity binding. These results show clearly that the fundamental basis for streptavidin's extremely strong biotin binding affinity is more complex than assumed, and illustrate some of the challenges that may arise when analyzing extremely strong ligand-protein binding interactions.",nonCancer
1475,"Glorisa superba Hydroalcoholic Extract from Tubers Attenuates Experimental Arthritis by Downregulating Inflammatory Mediators, and Phosphorylation of ERK/JNK/p-38.","Glorisa superba (GS) is a medicinal plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The present study was carried out to investigate the antiarthritic activity of Glorisa superba hydroalcoholic extract (GSHE) in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. Arthritis was induced by sub-plantar administration of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and GSHE (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day) was administered orally for 21 consecutive days. Joint diameter was measured on Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21. GSHE dose dependently attenuates the increased joint diameter and serum tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α level following induction of arthritis by adjuvant. This attenuation was well substantiated with reduced mRNA expression of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and NF-κB. Additionally, GSHE inhibited phosphorylation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway as there was decreased protein expression of MAPK (p-p38/p38 and p-ERK/ERK p-JNK/JNK ratio). Moreover, GSHE in a dose-dependent fashion normalized the redox status of ankle joint (GSH, malonaldialdehyde [MDA], and NO levels and superoxide dismutase [SOD] and catalase [CAT] activities) and displayed decreased inflammatory cell infiltration in histopathological findings. Taken together, these findings indicate that GSHE protects against AIA by modulating MAPK.",nonCancer
2373,Clinical significance of NOTCH1 intracellular cytoplasmic domain translocation into the nucleus in gastric cancer.,"Recent studies have shown constitutive activation of the Notch signaling pathway in various types of malignancies. However, it remains unclear whether this signaling pathway is activated in gastric cancer. In the present study, the aim was to investigate the role of Notch signaling in gastric cancer by investigating the subcellular localization of Notch-associated proteins in tissue samples from gastric cancer patients. Samples were obtained from 115 gastric cancer patients who had undergone surgery at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science without pre-operative chemotherapy or radiation. Subsequently the correlation between translocation of NOTCH1 intracellular cytoplasmic domain (NICD) into the nucleus (as measured by immunostaining) and survival in gastric cancer patients after surgery was investigated. The results were analyzed in reference to the patients' clinicopathological characteristics and the effects of these results on patient prognosis were determined. Significant correlations were observed between NICD nuclear localization and clinicopathological characteristics, such as tumor status (T factor), lymph node status (N factor), pathological stage and differentiation status. No significant correlations were observed between NICD nuclear localization and age, gender, tumor location, vein invasion or lymphatic invasion. Patients with >30% of cancer cell nuclei positively stained for NICD (as revealed by immunostaining) were associated with a significantly shorter survival following surgery than patients with <30% NICD-positive cancer cell nuclei (log-rank test, P=0.0194). Univariate analysis revealed that among the clinicopathological factors examined, T factor [risk rate (RR)=10.870; P=0.0016], N factor (RR=41.667; P=0.0003), lymphatic invasion (RR=13.158; P=0.0125), vein invasion (RR=25.000; P= 0.0019) and translocation of NICD to the nucleus (RR=3.937; P=0.0312) were all identified to be statistically significant prognostic factors. However, multivariate analysis revealed that translocation of NICD to the nucleus was not independently associated with an unfavourable prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. The present results suggest that NOTCH1 acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer. It is hypothesized that translocation of NICD into the nucleus may be used as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer.",nonCancer
1109,Differential sensitivity of ERBB2 kinase domain mutations towards lapatinib.,"Overexpression of the ERBB2 kinase is observed in about one-third of breast cancer patients and the dual ERBB1/ERBB2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib was recently approved for the treatment of advanced ERBB2-positive breast cancer. Mutations in the ERBB2 receptor have recently been reported in breast cancer at diagnosis and also in gastric, colorectal and lung cancer. These mutations may have an impact on the clinical responses achieved with lapatinib in breast cancer and may also have a potential impact on the use of lapatinib in other solid cancers. However, the sensitivity of lapatinib towards clinically observed ERBB2 mutations is not known. We cloned a panel of 8 clinically observed ERBB2 mutations, established stable cell lines and characterized their sensitivity towards lapatinib and alternative ERBB2 inhibitors. Both lapatinib-sensitive and lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were observed. Interestingly, we were able to generate lapatinib resistance mutations in wt-ERBB2 cells incubated with lapatinib for prolonged periods of time. This indicates that these resistance mutations may also cause secondary resistance in lapatinib-treated patients. Lapatinib-resistant ERBB2 mutations were found to be highly resistant towards AEE788 treatment but remained sensitive towards the dual irreversible inhibitors CL-387785 and WZ-4002. Patients harbouring certain ERBB2 kinase domain mutations at diagnosis may not benefit from lapatinib treatment. Moreover, secondary lapatinib resistance may develop due to kinase domain mutations. Irreversible ERBB2 inhibitors may offer alternative treatment options for breast cancer and other solid tumor patients harbouring lapatinib resistance mutations. In addition, these inhibitors may be of interest in the scenario of secondary lapatinib resistance.",cancer
1565,SMEpred workbench: a web server for predicting efficacy of chemically modified siRNAs.,"Chemical modifications have been extensively exploited to circumvent shortcomings in therapeutic applications of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). However, experimental designing and testing of these siRNAs or chemically modified siRNAs (cm-siRNAs) involves enormous resources. Therefore, in-silico intervention in designing cm-siRNAs would be of utmost importance. We developed SMEpred workbench to predict the efficacy of normal siRNAs as well as cm-siRNAs using 3031 heterogeneous cm-siRNA sequences from siRNAmod database. These include 30 frequently used chemical modifications on different positions of either siRNA strand. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was employed to develop predictive models utilizing various sequence features namely mono-, di-nucleotide composition, binary pattern and their hybrids. We achieved highest Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) of 0.80 during 10-fold cross validation and similar PCC value in independent validation. We have provided the algorithm in the 'SMEpred' pipeline to predict the normal siRNAs from the gene or mRNA sequence. For multiple modifications, we have assembled 'MultiModGen' module to design multiple modifications and further process them to evaluate their predicted efficacies. SMEpred webserver will be useful to scientific community engaged in use of RNAi-based technology as well as for therapeutic development.

1441,Electrical stimulation inhibits cytosine arabinoside-induced neuronal death by preventing apoptosis in dorsal root ganglion neurons.,"The current study aimed to investigate whether electrical stimulation could prevent apoptotic neuronal cell death during treatment with cytosine arabinoside (ara-C). From in-vitro experiments, the effects of electrical stimulation were assessed on neurite fragmentation and neuronal cell death in ara-C-treated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants. Ara-C treatment increased neurite fragmentation and neuronal cell death in DRG explants and activated caspase-3 by cleaving it, which could induce apoptosis. Electrical stimulation can significantly reduce neurite fragmentation and neuronal cell death compared with nonelectrically stimulated groups. Furthermore, electrical stimulation inhibited caspase-3 activation and reduced apoptotic neuronal death in DRG explants. It was suggested that the neuroprotective effect of electrical stimulation is likely mediated by the inhibition of caspase-3 activation and therefore the inhibition of apoptosis following ara-C treatment.",nonCancer
1980,Rheology guided rational selection of processing temperature to prepare copovidone/nifedipine amorphous solid dispersions via hot melt extrusion (HME).,"The production of amorphous solid dispersions via hot melt extrusion (HME) relies on elevated temperature and prolonged residence time, which can result in potential degradation and decomposition of thermally sensitive components. Herein, the rheological properties of a physical mixture of polymer/active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) were utilized to guide the selection of appropriate HME processing temperature. In the currently studied copovidone/nifedipine system, a critical temperature, which is substantially lower (~13℃) than the melting point of crystalline API, was captured during a temperature ramp examination and regarded as the critical point at which the API could molecularly dissolve into the polymer. Based on the identification of this critical point, various solid dispersions were prepared by HME processing below, at, and above the critical temperature (both below and above the melting temperature (Tm) of crystalline API). In addition, the resultant extrudates along with two control solid dispersions prepared by physical mixing and cryogenic milling were assessed by X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, hot stage microscopy, rheology and solid state NMR. Physicochemical properties of resultant solid dispersions indicated that the identified critical temperature is sufficient for the polymer/API system to reach a molecular-level mixing, manifested by the transparent and smooth appearance of extrudates, absence of API crystalline diffraction and melting peaks, dramatically decreased rheological properties and significantly improved polymer-API miscibility. Once the critical temperature has been achieved, further raising the processing temperature only results in limited improvement of API dispersion, reflected by slightly reduced storage modulus and complex viscosity and limited improvement in miscibility.",nonCancer
152,Cyclin D1 in non-small cell lung cancer: a key driver of malignant transformation.,"To review the evidence implicating the deregulation of cyclin D1 in the pathogenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to discuss the opportunities for targeted clinical intervention. Data published until June 2006 are summarized, and previously unpublished results from our own research are included. In normal cells, cyclin D1 complexes with and activates cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) and acts as a transcriptional regulator. The protein is frequently overexpressed in a wide range of cancers, sometimes coincident with CCND1 (cyclin D1) gene amplification (5-20% of tumours). A low level of somatic mutations have been seen in certain tumours. CCND1 is amplified in NSCLC and cyclin D1 is frequently overexpressed in tumours and pre-invasive bronchial lesions, generally from one parental allele. Mutation analyses revealed a frequent CCND1 gene polymorphism (A870G) that modulates alternative splicing and allows expression of an alternative cyclin D1 transcript (transcript cyclin D1b). The encoded cyclin D1b protein lacks a specific phosphorylation site required for nuclear export. Genotype has been correlated with the risk and/or severity of disease or drug response across a range of malignancies, including lung cancer. Together, these findings suggest a strong pathological role for cyclin D1 deregulation in bronchial neoplasia. Current data indicate that cyclin D1 overexpression is not a consequence of, but rather a pivotal element in the process of malignant transformation in the lung and other tissues. This understanding may open new avenues for lung cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention.",cancer
1167,Initial testing (stage 1) of AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) by the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program.,"AZD6244 (ARRY-142886) is a potent small molecule inhibitor of MEK1/2 that is in phase 2 clinical development. AZD6244 was tested against the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) in vitro panel (1 nM-10 microM). In vivo AZD6244 was tested at a dose of 100 mg/kg administered orally twice daily 5 days per week for 6 weeks. Subsequently, AZD6244 was evaluated against two juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma (JPA) xenografts using once and twice daily dosing schedules. Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was used as a surrogate for in vivo inhibition of MEK1/2 was determined by immunoblotting. At the highest concentration used in vitro (10 microM) AZD6244 only inhibited growth by 50% in 5 of the 23 cell lines. Against the in vivo tumor panels, AZD6244 induced significant differences in EFS distribution in 10 of 37 (27%) solid tumor models and 0 of 6 acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) models. There were no objective responses. Pharmacodynamic studies indicated at this dose and schedule AZD6244 completely inhibited ERK1/2 phosphorylation. AZD6244 was evaluated against two JPA xenografts, BT-35 (wild-type BRAF) and BT-40 (mutant [V600E] BRAF). BT-40 xenografts were highly sensitive to AZD6244, whereas BT-35 xenografts progressed on AZD6244 treatment. At the dose and schedule of administration used, AZD6244 as a single agent had limited in vitro and in vivo activity against the PPTP tumor panels despite inhibition of MEK1/2 activity. However, AZD6244 was highly active against BT-40 JPA xenografts that harbor constitutively activated BRAF, causing complete regressions.",cancer
2458,Circulating endothelial cells and their progenitors in acute myeloid leukemia.,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive hematological malignancy characterized by the accumulation of immature myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow. Studies are required to investigate the prognostic and predictive value of surrogate biomarkers. Given the importance of angiogenesis in oncology in terms of pathogenesis as well as being a target for treatment, circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are promising candidates to serve as such markers. The aim of the present study was to quantify CECs and EPCs in patients with AML at initial diagnosis and following induction chemotherapy, and to correlate these findings with the response to treatment in AML patients. The present study included 40 patients with de novo AML and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CECs and EPCs were evaluated by flow cytometry at initial diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy (3+7 protocol for AML other than M3 and all-trans-retinoic acid plus anthracycline for M3 disease). CECs and EPCs were significantly higher in AML patients at diagnosis and after induction chemotherapy than in controls. After induction chemotherapy, CECs and EPCs were significantly decreased compared with the levels at initial diagnosis. Patients who achieved complete response (n=28) had lower initial CEC and EPC levels compared with patients who did not respond to treatment. These results suggest that CEC levels are higher in AML patients and may correlate with disease status and treatment response. Further investigations are required to better determine the predictive value and implication of these cells in AML management.",nonCancer
1126,Possible roles for activating RAS mutations in the MGUS to MM transition and in the intramedullary to extramedullary transition in some plasma cell tumors.,"To assess a possible role in tumor progression, the occurrence and type of K- and N-RAS mutations were determined in purified tumor cells, including samples from patients with premalignant monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), multiple myeloma (MM), and extramedullary plasma cell (PC) tumors (ExPCTs). Immunophenotypic aberrant PCs were flow sorted from 20 MGUS, 58 MM, and 13 ExPCT patients. One RAS mutation was identified in 20 MGUS tumors (5%), in contrast to a much higher prevalence of RAS mutations in all stages of MM (about 31%). Further, oncogene analyses showed that RAS mutations are not evenly distributed among different molecular subclasses of MM, with the prevalence being increased in MM-expressing cyclin D1 (P = .015) and decreased in MM with t(4;14) (P = .055). We conclude that RAS mutations often provide a genetic marker if not a causal event in the evolution of MGUS to MM. Surprisingly, RAS mutations were absent in bone marrow tumor cells from all patients with ExPCT, a result significantly different from intramedullary MM (P = .001). From 3 of 6 patients with paired intramedullary and extramedullary PCs and identical immunoglobulin heavy chain gene (IgH) sequences, RAS mutations were identified only in extramedullary PCs, suggesting a role for RAS mutations in the transition from intramedullary to extramedullary tumor.",cancer
2011,Mast cell sarcoma: new cases and literature review.,"Mast cell sarcoma (MCS) is a rare form of mastocytosis characterized by the presence of solid tumor(s) comprising malignant mast cells that harbor destructive infiltration capability and metastatic potential. Here, we present an extensive literature review and report on 23 cases of MCS, including 3 new cases from the French National Reference Center for Mastocytosis. From our analysis, it appears that MCS can occur at any age. It can manifest de novo or, to a lesser extent, may evolve from a previously established mastocytosis. Bone tumor is a frequent manifestation, and symptoms of mast cell activation are rare. Histological diagnosis can be difficult because MCS is frequently composed of highly atypical neoplastic mast cells and can thus mimic other tumors. Unexpectedly, the canonical KIT D816V mutation is found in only 21% of MCS; therefore, complete KIT gene sequencing is required. The prognosis of patients with MCS is poor, with a median survival time of less than 18 months, and progression to mast cell leukemia is not unusual. Because conventional chemotherapies usually fail, the role of targeted therapies and bone marrow transplantation warrants further investigation in such aggressive neoplasms.",nonCancer

The efficacy of erlotinib in individual patients with rare EGFR mutations from the MERIT, SATURN, TITAN, TRUST, ATLAS, BeTa, and FASTACT-2 trials was analyzed and compared with data from the literature. In the patients tested for biomarkers, the frequency of rare mutations identified here ranged from 1.7% (eight of 467) in the SATURN study to 7.4% (27 of 364) in ATLAS. Some rare mutations were associated with greater clinical benefit from EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or improved prognosis independent of treatment, whereas others appeared to have a poorer prognosis. In particular, exon 18 G719 mutations, exon 19 K757R and E746G mutations, the exon 20 S768I mutation, and the exon 21 G836S mutation appeared to confer a good outcome with erlotinib treatment, whereas exon 18 S720I showed a particularly poor outcome. Owing to the small number of patients with each mutation, however, it is difficult to confirm whether these rare mutations do indeed confer sensitivity or resistance to erlotinib. Erlotinib can have different efficacy depending on the specific EGFR mutation. More research is needed to create a central database such as the My Cancer Genome database of rare mutations to definitively confirm whether these mutations are activating, resistant, or neutral.",cancer

A single-institution study was conducted in patients with advanced NSCLC. In personalized therapy group, patients received chemotherapy based on RRM-1 IHC expression levels. Low RRM1 group received gemcitabine or gemcitabine/cisplatin, high RRM1 group received docetaxel or docetaxel/ cisplatin. In standard therapy group, non-customized chemotherapy was delivered. In this trial, Patients aged ⩾ 70 years received single agent chemotherapy, whereas patients below 70 had platinum-based chemotherapy. There were statistically significant improvements between the personalized therapy group versus the standard therapy group in disease control rate (82.9% vs 55.3%, P=0.004), and PFS (median: 5.5 months vs 3.0 months, P=0.005). Besides, the OS had a tendency to become more prolonged (median: 16.0 months vs 12.4 months, P=0.286). The subgroup analysis suggested the survival benefit in the elderly patients was more obvious. RRM1 IHC expression tailored selection of first-line therapy could improve therapeutic outcomes in patients with advanced NSCLC.",cancer

2044,Particle-Tracking Microrheology Using Micro-Optical Coherence Tomography.,"Clinical manifestations of cystic fibrosis (CF) result from an increase in the viscosity of the mucus secreted by epithelial cells that line the airways. Particle-tracking microrheology (PTM) is a widely accepted means of determining the viscoelastic properties of CF mucus, providing an improved understanding of this disease as well as an avenue to assess the efficacies of pharmacologic therapies aimed at decreasing mucus viscosity. Among its advantages, PTM allows the measurement of small volumes, which was recently utilized for an in situ study of CF mucus formed by airway cell cultures. Typically, particle tracks are obtained from fluorescence microscopy video images, although this limits one's ability to distinguish particles by depth in a heterogeneous environment. Here, by performing PTM with high-resolution micro-optical coherence tomography (μOCT), we were able to characterize the viscoelastic properties of mucus, which enables simultaneous measurement of rheology with mucociliary transport parameters that we previously determined using μOCT. We obtained an accurate characterization of dextran solutions and observed a statistically significant difference in the viscosities of mucus secreted by normal and CF human airway cell cultures. We further characterized the effects of noise and imaging parameters on the sensitivity of μOCT-PTM by performing theoretical and numerical analyses, which show that our system can accurately quantify viscosities over the range that is characteristic of CF mucus. As a sensitive rheometry technique that requires very small fluid quantities, μOCT-PTM could also be generally applied to interrogate the viscosity of biological media such as blood or the vitreous humor of the eye in situ.",nonCancer
1911,Efficacy and Safety of IncobotulinumtoxinA in Asian Subjects: A Pooled Analysis of Clinical Trials in the Treatment of Glabellar Frown Lines.,"Owing to differences in facial anatomy and cultural beauty ideals, dose adaptations are often necessary when administering botulinum toxin type A to Asians and non-Asians.|To assess potential differences in the efficacy and safety of incobotulinumtoxinA in Asian and non-Asians.<br/> METHODS: Efficacy data were pooled from several Phase II/III trials that used 20 U incobotulinumtoxinA to treat glabellar frown lines in Asian subjects. The variable of interest was investigator-assessed improvement in scores on the 4-point Facial Wrinkle Scale from baseline to days 30, 60, 90, and 120. Subjects with a 1-point improvement were considered 'responders'. Data were also assessed for treatment-emergent adverse events, treatment-emergent serious adverse events, and adverse events of special interest among a pool of incobotulinumtoxinA safety studies.<br/> RESULTS: Four trials were pooled, comprising 19 Asian and 563 non-Asian subjects. At maximum frown on day 30, 100% of Asians and 87% of non-Asians were responders; by day 120, values were 37% and 40%, respectively. At rest on day 30, 63% of Asians and 56% of non-Asians were responders. Corresponding values for day 120 were 11% and 25%. The mean change in score on the Facial Wrinkle Scale from baseline over time was similar in both groups. Very few adverse events occurred. Overall, treatment-emergent adverse events were lower amongst Asians than non-Asians.<br/> CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non-Asians, a trend towards slightly higher responses was observed in Asians at maximum frown. There were no clinically relevant differences in the safety of incobotulinumtoxinA when administered to Asian and non-Asian subjects. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1084-1087.",nonCancer
2309,Systematic relationships of five newly sequenced cervid species.,"Cervid phylogenetics has been puzzling researchers for over 150 years. In recent decades, molecular systematics has provided new input for both the support and revision of the previous results from comparative anatomy but has led to only partial consensus. Despite all of the efforts to reach taxon-wide species sampling over the last two decades, a number of cervid species still lack molecular data because they are difficult to access in the wild. By extracting ancient DNA from museum specimens, in this study, we obtained partial mitochondrial cytochrome b gene sequences for Mazama bricenii, Mazama chunyi, Muntiacus atherodes, Pudu mephistophiles, and Rusa marianna, including three holotypes. These new sequences were used to enrich the existing mitochondrial DNA alignments and yielded the most taxonomically complete data set for cervids to date. Phylogenetic analyses provide new insights into the evolutionary history of these five species. However, systematic uncertainties within Muntiacus persist and resolving phylogenetic relationships within Pudu and Mazama remain challenging.",nonCancer
1198,Somatic mutations affect key pathways in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Determining the genetic basis of cancer requires comprehensive analyses of large collections of histopathologically well-classified primary tumours. Here we report the results of a collaborative study to discover somatic mutations in 188 human lung adenocarcinomas. DNA sequencing of 623 genes with known or potential relationships to cancer revealed more than 1,000 somatic mutations across the samples. Our analysis identified 26 genes that are mutated at significantly high frequencies and thus are probably involved in carcinogenesis. The frequently mutated genes include tyrosine kinases, among them the EGFR homologue ERBB4; multiple ephrin receptor genes, notably EPHA3; vascular endothelial growth factor receptor KDR; and NTRK genes. These data provide evidence of somatic mutations in primary lung adenocarcinoma for several tumour suppressor genes involved in other cancers--including NF1, APC, RB1 and ATM--and for sequence changes in PTPRD as well as the frequently deleted gene LRP1B. The observed mutational profiles correlate with clinical features, smoking status and DNA repair defects. These results are reinforced by data integration including single nucleotide polymorphism array and gene expression array. Our findings shed further light on several important signalling pathways involved in lung adenocarcinoma, and suggest new molecular targets for treatment.",cancer
1017,"Clinical activity of afatinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations: a combined post-hoc analysis of LUX-Lung 2, LUX-Lung 3, and LUX-Lung 6.","Most patients with non-small-cell lung cancer tumours that have EGFR mutations have deletion mutations in exon 19 or the Leu858Arg point mutation in exon 21, or both (ie, common mutations). However, a subset of patients (10%) with mutations in EGFR have tumours that harbour uncommon mutations. There is a paucity of data regarding the sensitivity of these tumours to EGFR inhibitors. Here we present data for the activity of afatinib in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer that have tumours harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations. In this post-hoc analysis, we used prospectively collected data from tyrosine kinase inhibitor-naive patients with EGFR mutation-positive advanced (stage IIIb-IV) lung adenocarcinomas who were given afatinib in a single group phase 2 trial (LUX-Lung 2), and randomised phase 3 trials (LUX-Lung 3 and LUX-Lung 6). Analyses were done in the intention-to-treat population, including all randomly assigned patients with uncommon EGFR mutations. The type of EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion [del19], Leu858Arg point mutation in exon 21, or other) and ethnic origin (LUX-Lung 3 only; Asian vs non-Asian) were pre-specified stratification factors in the randomised trials. We categorised all uncommon mutations as: point mutations or duplications in exons 18-21 (group 1); de-novo Thr790Met mutations in exon 20 alone or in combination with other mutations (group 2); or exon 20 insertions (group 3). We also assessed outcomes in patients with the most frequent uncommon mutations, Gly719Xaa, Leu861Gln, and Ser768Ile, alone or in combination with other mutations. Response was established by independent radiological review. These trials are registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbers NCT00525148, NCT00949650, and NCT01121393. Of 600 patients given afatinib across the three trials, 75 (12%) patients had uncommon EGFR mutations (38 in group 1, 14 in group 2, 23 in group 3). 27 (71·1%, 95% CI 54·1-84·6) patients in group 1 had objective responses, as did two (14·3%, 1·8-42·8) in group 2 and two (8·7%, 1·1-28·0) in group 3. Median progression-free survival was 10·7 months (95% CI 5·6-14·7) in group 1, 2·9 months (1·2-8·3) in group 2; and 2·7 months (1·8-4·2) in group 3. Median overall survival was 19·4 months (95% CI 16·4-26·9) in group 1, 14·9 months (8·1-24·9) in group 2, and 9·2 months (4·1-14·2) in group 3. For the most frequent uncommon mutations, 14 (77·8%, 95% CI 52·4-93·6) patients with Gly719Xaa had an objective response, as did nine (56·3%, 29·9-80·2) with Leu861Gln, and eight (100·0%, 63·1-100·0) with Ser768Ile. Afatinib was active in non-small-cell lung cancer tumours that harboured certain types of uncommon EGFR mutations, especially Gly719Xaa, Leu861Gln, and Ser768Ile, but less active in other mutations types. Clinical benefit was lower in patients with de-novo Thr790Met and exon 20 insertion mutations. These data could help inform clinical decisions for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harbouring uncommon EGFR mutations. Boehringer Ingelheim.",cancer
1491,"Factors Associated with the Anxiety, Subjective Psychological Well-Being and Self-Esteem of Parents of Blind Children.","The objective was to examine the connection of the personal, social and family context, educational variables with the levels of anxiety, subjective psychological well-being and self-esteem in a sample of 61 parents of blind children. Results suggest that parents present less anxiety when they have only one child, possess a technical degree, receive remuneration for their work, their child's visual impairment is not progressive, their knowledge about their child's disability is appropriate, and their leisure and labour possibilities have not been affected. Their psychological well-being is higher when they are married in first nuptials and perceive that their health is good. Their well-being is negatively related to reduced leisure, and self-esteem is lower when labour possibilities have been affected. In order for these families to achieve a more pleasant life, with greater psychological well-being, lower anxiety and higher self-esteem, professionals should be aware of the aspects with a negative impact.",nonCancer
647,Trastuzumab emtansine for HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.,"Trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) is an antibody-drug conjugate incorporating the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted antitumor properties of trastuzumab with the cytotoxic activity of the microtubule-inhibitory agent DM1. The antibody and the cytotoxic agent are conjugated by means of a stable linker. We randomly assigned patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer, who had previously been treated with trastuzumab and a taxane, to T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine. The primary end points were progression-free survival (as assessed by independent review), overall survival, and safety. Secondary end points included progression-free survival (investigator-assessed), the objective response rate, and the time to symptom progression. Two interim analyses of overall survival were conducted. Among 991 randomly assigned patients, median progression-free survival as assessed by independent review was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (hazard ratio for progression or death from any cause, 0.65; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.55 to 0.77; P<0.001), and median overall survival at the second interim analysis crossed the stopping boundary for efficacy (30.9 months vs. 25.1 months; hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.85; P<0.001). The objective response rate was higher with T-DM1 (43.6%, vs. 30.8% with lapatinib plus capecitabine; P<0.001); results for all additional secondary end points favored T-DM1. Rates of grade 3 or 4 adverse events were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine than with T-DM1 (57% vs. 41%). The incidences of thrombocytopenia and increased serum aminotransferase levels were higher with T-DM1, whereas the incidences of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia were higher with lapatinib plus capecitabine. T-DM1 significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival with less toxicity than lapatinib plus capecitabine in patients with HER2-positive advanced breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.

1096,Expression of the neurotrophin receptor TrkC is linked to a favorable outcome in medulloblastoma.,"Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant brain tumor of childhood, has a variable prognosis. Although half of the children and young adults with the disease survive longer than 10 years after diagnosis, the others relapse and die despite identical therapy. We have examined the expression of neurotrophins and their receptors in medulloblastoma samples snap frozen in the operating room to preserve RNA integrity. All tumors (n = 12) were found to express mRNA encoding neurotrophin 3 and its receptor TrkC. The level of trkC expression was highly variable, with a more than 50-fold difference between the highest and lowest values. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients with tumors expressing high levels of trkC mRNA had significantly longer intervals without disease progression than those with low levels (log-rank, P = 0.03) and a more favorable overall survival (log-rank, P = 0.05). Thus, trkC expression is a prognostic indicator for patients with medulloblastoma.",cancer
382,"Biomarkers of benefit from cetuximab-based therapy in metastatic colorectal cancer: interaction of EGFR ligand expression with RAS/RAF, PIK3CA genotypes.","More than half of patients with KRAS-wild type advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) fail anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. We studied EGFR-axis messenger RNA (mRNA) expression and RAS, RAF, PIK3CA mutations in order to identify additional biomarkers of cetuximab efficacy. Previously genotyped (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA mutations) formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tumour biopsies of 226 cetuximab-treated CRC patients (1st to 3rd line therapy) were assessed for mRNA expression of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its ligands EGF, Transofrming Growth Factor-a (TGFA), Amphiregulin (AREG) and Epiregulin (EREG) with real time quantitative PCR. Mutations were detected in 72 (31.9%) tumours for KRAS, in 6 (2.65%) for BRAF, in 7 (3.1%) for NRAS and in 37 (16.4%) for PIK3CA. Only PIK3CA mutations occasionally coexisted with other gene mutations. In univariate analysis, prognostic significance for survival ( from metastases until death) was seen for BRAF mutations (Hazard Ratio HR 8.1, 95% CI 3.4-19), codon 12-only KRAS mutations (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.1-2.4), high AREG mRNA expression only in KRAS wild type CRC (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.3-0.7) and high EREG mRNA expression irrespective of KRAS mutation status (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.28-0.7). EREG tumoural mRNA expression was significantly associated with a 2.26-fold increased likelihood of objective response to cetuximab therapy (RECIST 1.1). In multivariate analysis, favourable predictive factors were high AREG mRNA in KRAS wild type tumours, high EREG mRNA, low Ephrin A2 receptor mRNA. Cetuximab-treated patients with AREG-low KRAS wild type CRC fared very poorly, their survival being similar to KRAS mutant CRC. Patients with KRAS codon 13 or other non-codon 12 mutations had a median survival (30 months, 95% CI 20-35) similar to that of patients with KRAS wild-type (median survival 29 months, 95% CI 25-35), in contrast to patients with KRAS codon 12 mutations who fared worse (median survival 19 months, 95% CI 15-26). BRAF and codon 12 KRAS mutations predict for adverse outcome of CRC patients receiving cetuximab. AREG mRNA reflects EGFR signalling in KRAS wild type tumours, predicting for cetuximab efficacy when high and failure when low. EREG may have a prognostic role independent of KRAS mutation.",cancer
208,Prognostic parameters in uveal melanoma and their association with BAP1 expression.,"To determine whether BAP1 gene and protein expression associates with different prognostic parameters in uveal melanoma and whether BAP1 expression correctly identifies patients as being at risk for metastases, following enucleation of the primary tumour. Thirty cases of uveal melanoma obtained by enucleation between 1999 and 2004 were analysed for a variety of prognostic markers, including histological characteristics, chromosome aberrations obtained by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and gene expression profiling. These parameters were compared with BAP1 gene expression and BAP1 immunostaining. The presence of monosomy of chromosome 3 as identified by the different chromosome 3 tests showed significantly increased HRs (FISH on isolated nuclei cut-off 30%: HR 11.6, p=0.002; SNP analysis: HR 20.3, p=0.004) for death due to metastasis. The gene expression profile class 2, based on the 15-gene expression profile, similarly provided a significantly increased HR for a poor outcome (HR 8.5, p=0.005). Lower BAP1 gene expression and negative BAP1 immunostaining (50% of 28 tumours were immunonegative) were both associated with these markers for prognostication: FISH cut-off 30% monosomy 3 (BAP1 gene expression: p=0.037; BAP1 immunostaining: p=0.001), SNP-monosomy 3 (BAP1 gene expression: p=0.008; BAP1 immunostaining: p=0.002) and class 2 profile (BAP1 gene expression: p<0.001; BAP1 immunostaining: p=0.001) and were themselves associated with an increased risk of death due to metastasis (BAP1 gene expression dichotomised: HR 8.7, p=0.006; BAP1 immunostaining: HR 4.0, p=0.010). Loss of BAP1 expression associated well with all of the methods currently used for prognostication and was itself predictive of death due to metastasis in uveal melanoma after enucleation, thereby emphasising the importance of further research on the role of BAP1 in uveal melanoma.",cancer
1778,Xeno-Free Cryopreservation of Bone Marrow-Derived Multipotent Stromal Cells from Callithrix jacchus.,"In the previous decade, numerous biobanks were established and have created large markets for the storage of bioactive compounds, cells, and tissues for medical and diagnostic applications. For in vivo clinical and therapeutic purposes, it is critical to use well-defined and xeno-free components during cultivation, preservation, and transplantation of biological material. Safe and efficacious storage of bioactive molecules, cells, and tissues, without the addition of undefined medium components, minimizes risks of zoonotic disease transmission and is thus an essential and desirable prerequisite for biobanks. This gives rise to a need for well-characterized and serum-free freezing media for application in cryopreservation. For this purpose, cryobiological additives such as methylcellulose, poloxamer-188, and α-tocopherol, which have previously been shown to exhibit a cytoprotective activity, have been investigated for cryoprotection on stem cells. With this strategy, the application of fetal bovine serum (FBS) could be avoided and the concentration of toxic cryoprotective agents such as dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) could be reduced. Our results suggest that the viability, as well as the adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation capacity of the thawed bone marrow-derived multipotent stromal stem cells, could be maintained using a freezing medium without FBS consisting of methylcellulose, poloxamer, and α-tocopherol with only 2.5% DMSO (% v/v).",nonCancer
1152,Prognostic and predictive value of common mutations for treatment response and survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.,"We address the prognostic and predictive value of KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF mutations for clinical outcomes in response to active agents in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We determined KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations in tumours from 168 patients treated for mCRC at two institutions. All patients received 5-FU-based first-line chemotherapy and treatment outcome was analysed retrospectively. KRAS, BRAF and PIK3CA mutations were present in 62 (37%), 13 (8%) and 26 (15%) cases, respectively. Multivariate analysis uncovered BRAF mutation as an independent prognostic factor for decreased survival (hazard ratio (HR) 4.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.1-7.6). In addition, patients with BRAF-mutant tumours had significantly lower progression-free survival (PFS: HR 4.0, 95% CI 2.2-7.4) than those whose tumors that carried wild-type BRAF. Among 92 patients treated using chemotherapy and cetuximab as salvage therapy, KRAS mutation was associated with lack of response (P=0.002) and shorter PFS (P=0.09). BRAF (P=0.0005) and PIK3CA (P=0.01) mutations also predicted reduced PFS in response to cetuximab salvage therapy. These results underscore the potential of mutational profiling to identify CRCs with different natural histories or treatment responses. The adverse significance of BRAF mutation should inform patient selection and stratification in clinical trials.",cancer
2402,The complete genome sequence of the methanogenic archaeon ISO4-H5 provides insights into the methylotrophic lifestyle of a ruminal representative of the Methanomassiliicoccales.,"Methane emissions from agriculture represent around 9 % of global anthropogenic greenhouse emissions. The single largest source of this methane is animal enteric fermentation, predominantly from ruminant livestock where it is produced mainly in their fermentative forestomach (or reticulo-rumen) by a group of archaea known as methanogens. In order to reduce methane emissions from ruminants, it is necessary to understand the role of methanogenic archaea in the rumen, and to identify their distinguishing characteristics that can be used to develop methane mitigation technologies. To gain insights into the role of methylotrophic methanogens in the rumen environment, the genome of a methanogenic archaeon has been sequenced. This isolate, strain ISO4-H5, was isolated from the ovine rumen and belongs to the order Methanomassiliicoccales. Genomic analysis suggests ISO4-H5 is an obligate hydrogen-dependent methylotrophic methanogen, able to use methanol and methylamines as substrates for methanogenesis. Like other organisms within this order, ISO4-H5 does not possess genes required for the first six steps of hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Comparison between the genomes of different members of the order Methanomassiliicoccales revealed strong conservation in energy metabolism, particularly in genes of the methylotrophic methanogenesis pathway, as well as in the biosynthesis and use of pyrrolysine. Unlike members of Methanomassiliicoccales from human sources, ISO4-H5 does not contain the genes required for production of coenzyme M, and so likely requires external coenzyme M to survive.",nonCancer
1002,Etiology of Ibrutinib Therapy Discontinuation and Outcomes in Patients With Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.,"The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib is effective in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Reasons for discontinuing therapy with this drug and outcomes following discontinuation have not been evaluated outside of clinical trials with relatively short follow-up. To determine features associated with discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy and outcomes. A total of 308 patients participating in 4 sequential trials of ibrutinib at The Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center were included. These clinical trials accrued patients included in this analysis from May 2010 until April 2014, and data were locked in June 2014. Patients were evaluated for time to therapy discontinuation, reasons for discontinuation, and survival following discontinuation. For patients who discontinued therapy because of disease progression, targeted deep sequencing was performed in samples at baseline and time of relapse. With a median follow-up of 20 months, 232 patients remained on therapy, 31 had discontinued because of disease progression, and 45 had discontinued for other reasons. Disease progression includes Richter's transformation (RT) or progressive CLL. Richter's transformation appeared to occur early and CLL progressions later (cumulative incidence at 12 months, 4.5% [95% CI, 2.0%-7.0%] and 0.3% [95% CI, 0%-1.0%], respectively). Median survival following RT was 3.5 months (95% CI, 0.3-6.0 months) and 17.6 months (95% CI, 4.7 months-""not reached"") following CLL progression. Sequencing on peripheral blood from 8 patients with RT revealed 2 with mutations in BTK, and a lymph node sample showed no mutations in BTK or PLCG2. Deep sequencing on 11 patients with CLL progression revealed BTK or PLCG2 mutations in all. These mutations were not identified before treatment in any patient. This single-institution experience with ibrutinib confirms it to be an effective therapy and identifies, for the first time, baseline factors associated with ibrutinib therapy discontinuation. Outcomes data show poor prognosis after discontinuation, especially for those patients with RT. Finally, sequencing data confirm initial reports associating mutations in BTK and PLCG2 with progression and clearly show that CLL progressions are associated with these mutations, while RT is likely not. clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers:NCT01105247, NCT01217749, NCT01589302, and NCT01578707.",cancer

Among these, numerous studies have considered the theoretical link between IHD and chronic infections, including Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori). Considering that epidemiologic studies have produced conflicting results, due to geographical variations of IHD and H. pylori prevalence as well as heterogeneity of study designs, an alternative way to analyze this topic is to assess if consistency for a biological plausibility exists.

418,Caspase-8 expression is predictive of tumour response to death receptor 5 agonist antibody in Ewing's sarcoma.,"Despite good initial response to chemotherapy, 30% of Ewing's sarcoma (EWS) patients with localised tumours develop recurrent disease, associated with poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to address this challenge by conducting preclinical evaluation of a death receptor targeted agent in vitro and in vivo, and by identifying predictive biomarkers. Cell viability assays, drug dose responses, immunoblots, rescue with gene transfer, mice tumour models, and statistical comparisons of tumour growth and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. This study shows that many EWS cell lines are selectively sensitive to a death receptor DR5 antibody and are more resistant to a DR4 antibody. Preclinical evaluation of these cell lines indicates their sensitivity to human DR5 agonist antibody conatumumab in vitro, which induces rapid activation of caspase-8 and apoptosis. We also found that sensitivity to conatumumab correlates with expression of caspase-8. Furthermore, the catalytic activity of caspase-8 is both necessary and sufficient to confer this sensitivity. In vivo, conatumumab is active against an EWS cell line and a patient-derived xenograft with higher caspase-8 expression, but is not effective against another with lower caspase-8 expression. These studies suggest the potential of conatumumab as a therapeutic agent against EWS and caspase-8 as a predictive biomarker for sensitivity.",cancer
436,PTEN deficiency as a predictive biomarker of resistance to HER2-targeted therapy in advanced gastric cancer.,"To investigate the role of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway activation in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted therapy. We evaluated the predictive roles of PI3K, catalytic alpha (PIK3CA), and phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) in HER2-based therapy (either trastuzumab or lapatinib). PTEN expression and PIK3CA mutation were analyzed using immunohistochemistry and pyrosequencing. Forty-eight patients received trastuzumab (n = 39) or lapatinib (n = 9) combination chemotherapy. PTEN loss was found in 47.9% (n = 23), but no PIK3CA mutations were identified. Twenty-six (54.1%) patients responded to HER2-based therapy, without a significant difference between patients with PTEN loss and those without (52.2 vs. 56.0%). Among the patients with responsive disease, time to best response did not differ by PTEN status, but the duration of response was significantly shorter for patients with PTEN loss (median 4.2 vs. 6.1 months, p = 0.04). In addition, patients with PTEN loss had a significantly shorter progression-free survival time (median 4.9 vs. 7.3 months, p = 0.047). PTEN deficiency is an important predictive marker for early resistance to HER2 inhibitor treatment in gastric cancer patients. This finding may be useful for the development of drug combinations and identification of patients who need a modified treatment strategy.",cancer

From December 2009 to January 2012, 18 advanced progressing chordoma patients entered this study (median age: 61 years; disease extent: metastatic 72% and locally advanced 28%). Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expression and activation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and/or phospho-arrays, real-time polimerase chain reaction, fluorescence immunostaining. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis was also carried out. Patients received lapatinib 1500 mg/day (mean dose intensity = 1282 mg/day), until progression or toxicity. The primary study end point was response rate (RR) as per Choi criteria. Secondary end points were RR by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST), overall survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and clinical benefit rate (CBR; RECIST complete response + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD) ≥ 6 months). All patients were evaluable for response. Six (33.3%) patients had PR and 7 (38.9%) SD, as their best Choi responses, corresponding to RECIST SD in all cases. Median PFS by Choi was 6 [interquartile (IQ) range 3-8] months. Median PFS by RECIST was 8 (IQ range 4-12) months, with a 22% CBR. This phase II study showed a modest antitumor activity of lapatinib in chordoma. The clinical exploitation of EGFR targeting in chordoma needs to be further investigated, both clinically and preclinically.

METHODS We prospectively designed and conducted three phase III trials (Four-Arm Cooperative Study, LC00-03, and S0003) in advanced-stage, non-small-cell lung cancer, each with a common arm of paclitaxel plus carboplatin. Genomic DNA was collected from patients in LC00-03 and S0003 who received paclitaxel (225 mg/m(2)) and carboplatin (area under the concentration-time curve, 6). Genotypic variants of CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2C8, NR1I2-206, ABCB1, ERCC1, and ERCC2 were analyzed by pyrosequencing or by PCR restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results were assessed by Cox model for survival and by logistic regression for response and toxicity. Results Clinical results were similar in the two Japanese trials, and were significantly different from the US trial, for survival, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and anemia. There was a significant difference between Japanese and US patients in genotypic distribution for CYP3A4*1B (P = .01), CYP3A5*3C (P = .03), ERCC1 118 (P < .0001), ERCC2 K751Q (P < .001), and CYP2C8 R139K (P = .01). Genotypic associations were observed between CYP3A4*1B for progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.14 to 0.94; P = .04) and ERCC2 K751Q for response (HR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.83; P = .02). For grade 4 neutropenia, the HR for ABCB1 3425C-->T was 1.84 (95% CI, 0.77 to 4.48; P = .19). CONCLUSION Differences in allelic distribution for genes involved in paclitaxel disposition or DNA repair were observed between Japanese and US patients. In an exploratory analysis, genotype-related associations with patient outcomes were observed for CYP3A4*1B and ERCC2 K751Q. This common-arm approach facilitates the prospective study of population-related pharmacogenomics in which ethnic differences in antineoplastic drug disposition are anticipated.",cancer
2229,Efficacy of Transcutaneous Electric Nerve Stimulation on Parotid Saliva Flow Rate in Relation to Age and Gender.,"Treatment with salivary substitutes and stimulation of salivary flow by either mechanical or pharmacologic methods has side effects and only provides symptomatic relief but no long-lasting results.|To assess the effectiveness of extraoral transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) as a mean of stimulating salivary function in healthy adult subjects; as well as to determine the gender and age-dependent changes in salivary flow rates of unstimulated and stimulated parotid saliva.|Hundred patients were divided into two groups; Group I aged 20-40 and Group II aged ≥ 60 years. The TENS electrode pads were externally placed on the skin overlying the parotid glands. Unstimulated and stimulated parotid saliva was collected for 5 minutes each by using standardized collection techniques.|Eighty seven of 100 subjects demonstrated increased salivary flow when stimulated via the TENS unit. Ten experienced no increase and 3 experienced a decrease. The mean unstimulated salivary flow rate was 0.01872 ml/min in Group I and 0.0088 ml/min in Group II. The mean stimulated salivary flow rate was 0.03084 ml/min (SD= 0.01248) in Group I, and 0.01556 ml/min (SD 0.0101) in Group II. After stimulation, the amount of salivary flow increased significantly in both groups (p< 0.001). Statistical comparison of the two groups revealed them to be significantly different (p< 0.001), with Group I producing more saliva. Gender-wise, no statistically significant difference was seen among the subjects in Group I (p = 0.148), and those in Group II (p= 0.448). Out of 12 subjects with 0 baseline flows, 7 continued to have no flow. Five subjects observed side effects, although minimal and transient.|The TENS unit was effective in increasing parotid gland salivary flow in healthy subjects. There was age-related but no gender-related variability in parotid salivary flow rate.",nonCancer
585,PSMB8 and PBK as potential gastric cancer subtype-specific biomarkers associated with prognosis.,"Gastric adenocarcinoma is a common form of cancer associated with a poor prognosis. We analyzed microarray profiling data from 48 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma to characterize gastric cancer subtypes and identify biomarkers associated with prognosis. We identified two major subtypes of gastric adenocarcinoma differentially associated with overall survival (P = 0.025). Genes that were differentially expressed were identified using specific criteria (P < 0.001 and >1.5-fold); expression of 294 and 116 genes was enriched in good and poor prognosis subtypes, respectively. Genes related to translational elongation and cell cycle were upregulated in the poor prognosis group. Of these genes, upregulation of proteasome subunit beta type 8 PSMB8 and PDZ binding kinase PBK was confirmed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR analysis. PSMB8 or PBK knockdown had no effect on gastric cancer cell proliferation but suppressed cell migration and invasion, respectively. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry analysis of 385 gastric cancer patients revealed that increased nuclear expression of PSMB8 and PBK was correlated with depth of invasion, lymph node metastasis, and lower survival rates. Taken together, two gastric adenocarcinoma subtypes were predictive of prognosis. PSMB8 and PBK were predictive of gastric cancer prognosis and could be potential gastric cancer subtype-specific biomarkers.",cancer
2524,Time-scale dynamics of proteome and transcriptome of the white-rot fungus Phlebia radiata: growth on spruce wood and decay effect on lignocellulose.,"The white-rot Agaricomycetes species Phlebia radiata is an efficient wood-decaying fungus degrading all wood components, including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. We cultivated P. radiata in solid state cultures on spruce wood, and extended the experiment to 6 weeks to gain more knowledge on the time-scale dynamics of protein expression upon growth and wood decay. Total proteome and transcriptome of P. radiata were analyzed by peptide LC-MS/MS and RNA sequencing at specific time points to study the enzymatic machinery on the fungus' natural growth substrate.|According to proteomics analyses, several CAZy oxidoreductase class-II peroxidases with glyoxal and alcohol oxidases were the most abundant proteins produced on wood together with enzymes important for cellulose utilization, such as GH7 and GH6 cellobiohydrolases. Transcriptome additionally displayed expression of multiple AA9 lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases indicative of oxidative cleavage of wood carbohydrate polymers. Large differences were observed for individual protein quantities at specific time points, with a tendency of enhanced production of specific peroxidases on the first 2 weeks of growth on wood. Among the 10 class-II peroxidases, new MnP1-long, characterized MnP2-long and LiP3 were produced in high protein abundances, while LiP2 and LiP1 were upregulated at highest level as transcripts on wood together with the oxidases and one acetyl xylan esterase, implying their necessity as primary enzymes to function against coniferous wood lignin to gain carbohydrate accessibility and fungal growth. Majority of the CAZy encoding transcripts upregulated on spruce wood represented activities against plant cell wall and were identified in the proteome, comprising main activities of white-rot decay.|Our data indicate significant changes in carbohydrate-active enzyme expression during the six-week surveillance of P. radiata growing on wood. Response to wood substrate is seen already during the first weeks. The immediate oxidative enzyme action on lignin and wood cell walls is supported by detected lignin substructure sidechain cleavages, release of phenolic units, and visual changes in xylem cell wall ultrastructure. This study contributes to increasing knowledge on fungal genetics and lignocellulose bioconversion pathways, allowing us to head for systems biology, development of biofuel production, and industrial applications on plant biomass utilizing wood-decay fungi.",nonCancer
658,Selective Inhibition of Oncogenic KRAS Output with Small Molecules Targeting the Inactive State.,"KRAS gain-of-function mutations occur in approximately 30% of all human cancers. Despite more than 30 years of KRAS-focused research and development efforts, no targeted therapy has been discovered for cancers with KRAS mutations. Here, we describe ARS-853, a selective, covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C) that inhibits mutant KRAS-driven signaling by binding to the GDP-bound oncoprotein and preventing activation. Based on the rates of engagement and inhibition observed for ARS-853, along with a mutant-specific mass spectrometry-based assay for assessing KRAS activation status, we show that the nucleotide state of KRAS(G12C) is in a state of dynamic flux that can be modulated by upstream signaling factors. These studies provide convincing evidence that the KRAS(G12C) mutation generates a ""hyperexcitable"" rather than a ""statically active"" state and that targeting the inactive, GDP-bound form is a promising approach for generating novel anti-RAS therapeutics. A cell-active, mutant-specific, covalent inhibitor of KRAS(G12C) is described that targets the GDP-bound, inactive state and prevents subsequent activation. Using this novel compound, we demonstrate that KRAS(G12C) oncoprotein rapidly cycles bound nucleotide and responds to upstream signaling inputs to maintain a highly active state.",cancer
1463,Multicenter Evaluation of Geometric Accuracy of MRI Protocols Used in Experimental Stroke.,"It has recently been suggested that multicenter preclinical stroke studies should be carried out to improve translation from bench to bedside, but the accuracy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners routinely used in experimental stroke has not yet been evaluated. We aimed to assess and compare geometric accuracy of preclinical scanners and examine the longitudinal stability of one scanner using a simple quality assurance (QA) protocol. Six 7 Tesla animal scanners across six different preclinical imaging centers throughout Europe were used to scan a small structural phantom and estimate linear scaling errors in all orthogonal directions and volumetric errors. Between-scanner imaging consisted of a standard sequence and each center's preferred sequence for the assessment of infarct size in rat models of stroke. The standard sequence was also used to evaluate the drift in accuracy of the worst performing scanner over a period of six months following basic gradient calibration. Scaling and volumetric errors using the standard sequence were less variable than corresponding errors using different stroke sequences. The errors for one scanner, estimated using the standard sequence, were very high (above 4% scaling errors for each orthogonal direction, 18.73% volumetric error). Calibration of the gradient coils in this system reduced scaling errors to within ±1.0%; these remained stable during the subsequent 6-month assessment. In conclusion, despite decades of use in experimental studies, preclinical MRI still suffers from poor and variable geometric accuracy, influenced by the use of miscalibrated systems and various types of sequences for the same purpose. For effective pooling of data in multicenter studies, centers should adopt standardized procedures for system QA and in vivo imaging.",nonCancer
488,Elevation of c-FLIP in castrate-resistant prostate cancer antagonizes therapeutic response to androgen receptor-targeted therapy.,"To characterize the importance of cellular Fas-associated death domain (FADD)-like interleukin 1β-converting enzyme (FLICE) inhibitory protein (c-FLIP), a key regulator of caspase-8 (FLICE)-promoted apoptosis, in modulating the response of prostate cancer cells to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapy. c-FLIP expression was characterized by immunohistochemical analysis of prostatectomy tissue. The functional importance of c-FLIP to survival and modulating response to bicalutamide was studied by molecular and pharmacologic interventions. c-FLIP expression was increased in high-grade prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostate cancer tissue relative to normal prostate epithelium (P < 0.001). Maximal c-FLIP expression was detected in castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC; P < 0.001). In vitro, silencing of c-FLIP induced spontaneous apoptosis and increased 22Rv1 and LNCaP cell sensitivity to bicalutamide, determined by flow cytometry, PARP cleavage, and caspase activity assays. The histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), droxinostat and SAHA, also downregulated c-FLIP expression, induced caspase-8- and caspase-3/7-mediated apoptosis, and increased apoptosis in bicalutamide-treated cells. Conversely, the elevated expression of c-FLIP detected in the CRPC cell line VCaP underpinned their insensitivity to bicalutamide and SAHA in vitro. However, knockdown of c-FLIP induced spontaneous apoptosis in VCaP cells, indicating its relevance to cell survival and therapeutic resistance. c-FLIP reduces the efficacy of AR-targeted therapy and maintains the viability of prostate cancer cells. A combination of HDACi with androgen deprivation therapy may be effective in early-stage disease, using c-FLIP expression as a predictive biomarker of sensitivity. Direct targeting of c-FLIP, however, may be relevant to enhance the response of existing and novel therapeutics in CRPC.",cancer
679,The Hsp90 inhibitor IPI-504 rapidly lowers EML4-ALK levels and induces tumor regression in ALK-driven NSCLC models.,"Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is an emerging target for cancer therapy due to its important role in maintaining the activity and stability of key oncogenic signaling proteins. We show here that the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4)-anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion protein, presumed to be the oncogenic driver in about 5% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is associated with Hsp90 in cells and is rapidly degraded upon exposure of cells to IPI-504. We find EML4-ALK to be more sensitive to Hsp90 inhibition than either HER2 or mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with an inhibitory concentration (IC)(50) for protein degradation in the low nanomolar range. This degradation leads to a potent inhibition of downstream signaling pathways and to the induction of growth arrest and apoptosis in cells carrying the EML4-ALK fusion. To generate a causative link between the expression of EML4-ALK and sensitivity to IPI-504, we introduced an EML4-ALK cDNA into HEK293 cells and show that the expression of the fusion protein sensitizes cells to IPI-504 both in vitro and in vivo. In a xenograft model of a human NSCLC cell line containing the ALK rearrangement, we observe tumor regression at clinically relevant doses of IPI-504. Finally, cells that have been selected for resistance to ALK kinase inhibitors retain their sensitivity to IPI-504. We have recently observed partial responses to administration of IPI-504 as a single agent in a phase 2 clinical trial in patients with NSCLC, specifically in patients that carry an ALK rearrangement. This study provides a molecular explanation for these clinical observations.",cancer
2422,miR-429 promotes the proliferation of non-small cell lung cancer cells via targeting DLC-1.,"The microRNA (miR)-200 family has been demonstrated to be associated with the tumorigenesis and progression of multiple types of human cancer, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). As a member of the miR-200 family, miR-429 was recently identified to have an oncogenic role in NSCLC. However, the role of miR-429 in NSCLC growth as well as the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, NSCLC cell line H1229 was transfected with miR-429 mimic or inhibitor, respectively. It was observed that overexpression of miR-429 led to a significant increase in NSCLC cell proliferation, while knockdown of miR-429 suppressed the proliferation of H1229 cells. Bioinformatic prediction suggested that deleted in liver cancer 1 (DLC-1), a tumor suppressor in NSCLC, was a putative target gene of miR-429. Therefore, a luciferase reporter assay was performed and confirmed that miR-429 was able to bind the 3'-untranslated region of DLC-1 mRNA in H1229 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-429 inhibited the protein expression of DLC-1, while knockdown of miR-429 promoted the protein expression of DLC-1 in NSCLC H1229 cells. In addition, overexpression of DLC-1 not only inhibited H1229 cell proliferation, but also additionally reversed the promoting effect of miR-429 overexpression on H1229 cell proliferation. Based on these findings, the present study suggests that miR-429 may have an oncogenic role in the regulation of cell proliferation via direct inhibition of DLC-1 protein expression in NSCLC cells. Therefore, miR-429 may present a putative therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC growth.",nonCancer
396,"Complementary genetic screens identify the E3 ubiquitin ligase CBLC, as a modifier of PARP inhibitor sensitivity.","Based on a series of basic, preclinical and clinical studies, the Poly (ADP-ribose) Polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibitor, olaparib, has recently been approved for use in ovarian cancer patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. By identifying novel predictive biomarkers of tumour cell sensitivity to olaparib, it is possible that the utility of PARP inhibitors could be extended beyond this patient subgroup. Many of the known genetic determinants of PARP inhibitor response have key roles in DNA damage response (DDR) pathways. Although protein ubiquitylation is known to play an important role in regulating the DDR, the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. Using two parallel RNA interference-based screening approaches, we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase, CBLC, as a candidate biomarker of response to olaparib. We validated this observation by demonstrating that silencing of CBLC causes increased sensitivity to olaparib in breast cancer cell line models and that defective homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair is the likely cause. This data provides an example of how defects in the ubiquitin machinery have the potential to influence the response of tumour cells to PARP inhibitors.",cancer
1644,Diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT for detecting synchronous advanced colorectal neoplasia in patients with gastric cancer.,"Preoperative screening for synchronous colorectal neoplasia (CRN) has been recommended in patients with gastric cancer because patients with gastric cancer are at increased risk for synchronous CRN. The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of F-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) for detecting synchronous advanced CRN in patients with gastric cancer.A total of 256 patients who underwent colonoscopy and F-FDG PET/CT for preoperative staging were enrolled in this study. The diagnosis of focal colonic F-FDG uptake on F-FDG PET/CT image was made based on histopathologic results from the colonoscopic biopsy. The F-FDG PET/CT result was considered as true positive for advanced CRN when focal F-FDG uptake matched colorectal carcinoma or adenoma with high-grade dysplasia in the same location on colonoscopy.Synchronous advanced CRN was detected in 21 of the 256 patients (4.7%). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of F-FDG PET/CT were 76.2%, 96.2%, and 94.5%. The size of CRN with a true positive result was significantly larger than that with a false negative result.F-FDG PET/CT demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for detecting synchronous advanced CRN in patients with gastric cancer. Colonoscopy is recommended as the next diagnostic step for further evaluation of a positive F-FDG PET/CT result in patients with gastric cancer.",nonCancer

In IBD-RCC, younger age at RCC diagnosis [median (interquartile range) 46 (42-58) vs. 63 (52-75) years; P=0.02], immunosuppressive therapy (100 vs. 24%; P<0.0004), partial nephrectomy (86 vs. 33%; P=0.02), and surgery less than 1 month after diagnosis of RCC (71 vs. 14%; P=0.004) were associated with anti-TNF.

904,Combined treatment with everolimus and fulvestrant reversed anti-HER2 resistance in a patient with refractory advanced breast cancer: a case report.,"Everolimus, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin, shows promising antitumor activity when combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer or when combined with endocrine agents for hormone receptor (HR)-positive tumors. However, data are limited regarding the effect of everolimus in combination with endocrine drugs in HER2-positive advanced breast cancer regardless of the HR status. A 44-year-old female was diagnosed with recurrent HER2-positive breast cancer. The primary tumor was HR positive; however, the metastatic tumor was HR negative. The patient was resistant to classical chemotherapeutic agents and anti-HER2 treatment. Thus, the combination of everolimus and fulvestrant, a selective estrogen receptor downregulator, was chosen to reverse the resistance to anti-HER2 therapy. Indeed, the patient experienced long-term disease stabilization. Adverse events associated with the treatment were manageable by dose adjustments. We performed genetic testing of the metastatic tumor, which harbored a PIK3CA gene mutation but was positive for phosphatase and tensin homologue expression, which might result in resistance to the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor. This case study indicates that combined treatment with everolimus and fulvestrant might be a viable option for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer patients who are HER2 positive and carry a PIK3CA gene mutation but are resistant to anti-HER2 therapy and classical chemotherapeutic agents. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm this finding.",cancer
254,Prognostic significance of truncating TP53 mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"TP53 is a key gene in cellular homeostasis and is frequently mutated in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There is a variety of TP53 mutations, each with its own biological and clinical implication. Aim of the study was to assess the prognostic significance of TP53 mutations in HNSCCs and to identify the most relevant mutation. TP53 mutation status was investigated in 141 consecutive HNSCCs treated by surgery with radiotherapy when indicated and with a known human papilloma virus status. The type of mutation was correlated with overall and progression-free survival in a multivariate two-sided Cox regression analysis with wild type as reference. A TP53 mutation was found in 88 (62.4%) of the carcinomas and was not significantly associated with overall survival (HR = 1.65, P = 0.11). Patients with a mutation resulting in a truncated protein (n = 36, 25.5%) had a significantly worse overall survival (HR = 2.54, P = 0.008) and progression-free survival (HR = 2.65, P = 0.002). Four of these mutations were at a splice site, 13 were nonsense mutations (produces stop codon), and 19 were insertions or deletions resulting in a frameshift. After multivariate analysis, a truncating mutation remained a significant prognosticator. A missense (i.e., nontruncating) mutation did not influence prognosis. Other ways of classification (disruptive vs. nondisruptive, hotspot vs. nonhotspot, and DNA binding vs. non-DNA binding) were less discriminative. In HNSCCs, a truncating TP53 mutation is associated with a poor prognosis. This patient group seems as a target population for adjuvant therapy with chemoradiation or viral vector-mediated TP53 gene transfer.",cancer

We correlated our data with lytic capabilities of stimulated T-cells in a fluorolysis-assay and clinical data: Dendritic-cell-/mononuclear-cell-stimulation of T-cells resulted in increased cytokine-levels in culture-medium compared to serum. There were no significant differences between cytokine-patterns of cases with/without lytic T-cell-activity, response to immunotherapy (stem cell transplantation/donor-lymphocyte-infusion) or graft-versus-host-disease. However, some predictive cytokine-cut-off-values for antileukaemic T-cell-activity, patients' response to immunotherapy and graft-versus-host-disease could be defined. Cytokine-profiles alone, without functional assays, are no useful tool to predict antileukaemic T-cell-function, although they can indicate lytic T-cell-activity, patients' response to immunotherapy and graft-versus-host-disease.",nonCancer
1583,Designing personal grief rituals: An analysis of symbolic objects and actions.,"Personal grief rituals are beneficial in dealing with complicated grief, but challenging to design, as they require symbolic objects and actions meeting clients' emotional needs. The authors reported interviews with 10 therapists with expertise in both grief therapy and grief rituals. Findings indicate three types of rituals supporting honoring, letting go, and self transformation, with the latter being particularly complex. Outcome also point to a taxonomy of ritual objects for framing and remembering ritual experience, and for capturing and processing grief. Besides symbolic possessions, the authors identified other types of ritual objects including transformational and future-oriented ones. Symbolic actions include creative craft of ritual objects, respectful handling, disposal, and symbolic play. They conclude with theoretical implications of these findings, and a reflection on their value for tailored, creative co-design of grief rituals. In particular, several implications for designing grief rituals were identified that include accounting for the client's need, selecting (or creating) the most appropriate objects and actions from the identified types, integrating principles of both grief and art/drama therapy, exploring clients' affinity for the ancient elements as medium of disposal in letting go rituals, and the value of technology for recording and reflecting on ritual experience.",nonCancer
1193,Alterations in p53 predict response to preoperative high dose chemotherapy in patients with gastric cancer.,"To evaluate the usefulness of molecular markers in predicting histopathological and clinical response to preoperative high dose chemotherapy (HDCT) and survival of patients with advanced gastric cancer. In a phase II trial, 25 patients with metastatic gastric cancer received preoperative tandem HDCT consisting of etoposide, cisplatin, and mitomycin, followed by autologous bone marrow transplantation to achieve surgical resectability. Samples before and after treatment, from normal and tumour tissue, were characterised histopathologically, and both p53 and BAX expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry. Pretreatment formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded samples from normal and tumour tissue were microdissected, and the extracted DNA was preamplified using improved primer extension preamplification polymerase chain reaction. Detection of microsatellite instability (MSI) or loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was performed using markers for p53, BAX, BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D17S250, and APC. Exons 5-9 of the p53 gene were sequenced directly on ABI 373. Four parameters were significantly associated with response to chemotherapy and prolonged overall survival: positive p53 immunostaining, positive p53 mutation status before chemotherapy, strong histological regression induced by preoperative HDCT, and surgical treatment. Patients's sex or age, tumour location or stage, lymph node status, Lauren classification, MSI, or LOH did not influence duration of survival significantly in this high risk population. Positive p53 immunostaining and p53 mutation status in pretreatment tumour biopsies might be useful molecular predictors of response and prognosis in patients with advanced gastric cancer treated by preoperative HDCT.",cancer
1550,Mesenchymal Stromal Cell-Based Therapies for Chronic Lung Disease of Prematurity.,"Advances in perinatal care allow the survival of ever more premature infants. By approaching the biological limit of viability, survival free of injury becomes more challenging. As a consequence, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), the chronic lung disease of prematurity, remains one of the main complications in infants born before 28 weeks' gestation. Currently, there is no treatment for BPD. Recent progress in understanding the biology of stem cells has opened unprecedented therapeutic options to mitigate lung injury and promote lung growth. Perinatal tissue, such as the umbilical cord and the placenta, represents a rich source of potent repair cells. Thus far, mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)-based therapies demonstrate the most potential for protecting the developing lung from injury. Preclinical evidence supporting this potential therapeutic role has provided the basis for the initiation of phase I and II clinical trials in preterm neonates.

Gorham-Stout phenomenon (GSP) is a rare condition characterized by proliferation of vascular structures in bones, resulting in progressive osteolysis. Here we present a 1-year-old boy with PHTS and GSP. The lesion that later proved to be GSP was evident from the age of 4 months, and became symptomatic at the age of 1 year. Eventually, he developed a fatal chylothorax. Mutation analysis revealed a germline heterozygous mutation c.517 C>T (p.Arg173Cys) in exon 6 of PTEN. Analysis of the lymphatic malformation (LM) tissue revealed no loss of heterozygosity (LOH) nor a second, somatic PTEN mutation of the remaining wild type allele. The germline p.Arg173Cys mutation was also present in the mother and the propositus' younger sister and brother. Further molecular work-up showed a heterozygous variant c.2180C>T (p.Ala727Val) FLT4 in the LM tissue, which was also present in the germline of mother and two siblings. GSP has not been reported before in a patient with a PTEN mutation. Up to this date, this mutation is the only genetic defect possibly involved in the etiology of GSP which is plausible given the known function of PTEN in angiogenic signaling.",cancer
1099,Amplification of the MET receptor drives resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer.,"EGF receptor (EGFR)-targeted monoclonal antibodies are effective in a subset of metastatic colorectal cancers. Inevitably, all patients develop resistance, which occurs through emergence of KRAS mutations in approximately 50% of the cases. We show that amplification of the MET proto-oncogene is associated with acquired resistance in tumors that do not develop KRAS mutations during anti-EGFR therapy. Amplification of the MET locus was present in circulating tumor DNA before relapse was clinically evident. Functional studies show that MET activation confers resistance to anti-EGFR therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Notably, in patient-derived colorectal cancer xenografts, MET amplification correlated with resistance to EGFR blockade, which could be overcome by MET kinase inhibitors. These results highlight the role of MET in mediating primary and secondary resistance to anti-EGFR therapies in colorectal cancer and encourage the use of MET inhibitors in patients displaying resistance as a result of MET amplification.",cancer
2289,Prediction of pKa values using the PM6 semiempirical method.,"The PM6 semiempirical method and the dispersion and hydrogen bond-corrected PM6-D3H+ method are used together with the SMD and COSMO continuum solvation models to predict pKa values of pyridines, alcohols, phenols, benzoic acids, carboxylic acids, and phenols using isodesmic reactions and compared to published ab initio results. The pKa values of pyridines, alcohols, phenols, and benzoic acids considered in this study can generally be predicted with PM6 and ab initio methods to within the same overall accuracy, with average mean absolute differences (MADs) of 0.6-0.7 pH units. For carboxylic acids, the accuracy (0.7-1.0 pH units) is also comparable to ab initio results if a single outlier is removed. For primary, secondary, and tertiary amines the accuracy is, respectively, similar (0.5-0.6), slightly worse (0.5-1.0), and worse (1.0-2.5), provided that di- and tri-ethylamine are used as reference molecules for secondary and tertiary amines. When applied to a drug-like molecule where an empirical pKa predictor exhibits a large (4.9 pH unit) error, we find that the errors for PM6-based predictions are roughly the same in magnitude but opposite in sign. As a result, most of the PM6-based methods predict the correct protonation state at physiological pH, while the empirical predictor does not. The computational cost is around 2-5 min per conformer per core processor, making PM6-based pKa prediction computationally efficient enough to be used for high-throughput screening using on the order of 100 core processors.",nonCancer

The FeCo nanorods (~800 nm) and nanocubes (~100 nm) were fabricated by a facile surfactant and polymer-assisted one-pot borohydride reduction method. The growth mechanism depicted a two-directional growth for cubes whereas for nanorods, a unidirectional growth pattern across (110) plane was evident. A total shielding effectiveness (SET) of -44 dB at 18 GHz was achieved for a particular combination of FeCo nanorods and MWCNT and for nanocube-based composites, it was found to be -39 dB at 18 GHz. It was observed from ZFC-FC (zero field cooled-field cooled) curves that the samples displayed room temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM). An excellent correlation between high aspect-ratio FeCo nanorod and superior EM absorption (89%) was explored pertaining to the fact that nanorods possessed higher magnetic saturation (177.1 emu/g) and coercivity (550 Oe), in contrast to the nanocube with similar composition. Furthermore, theoretical insight into the mechanism revealed a high degree of interface scattering between conductive MWCNT and magnetic loss components, giving rise to an excellent synergy between magnetic and dielectric parts.",nonCancer
2203,48 week outcomes of maraviroc-containing regimens following the genotypic or Trofile assay in HIV-1 failing subjects: the OSCAR Study.,"This study assessed the 48-week efficacy of an antiretroviral therapy including maraviroc following the assessment of co-receptor tropism by use of Geno2Pheno algorithm or the Trofile phenotypic assay in failing treatment-experienced HIV-1 patients. This was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority trial. Treatment-experienced subjects with HIV-RNA ≥500 copies/mL were randomized (1:1) to undergo co-receptor tropism testing by the Geno- 2Pheno algorithm (with a false positive rate >10%) or the Trofile assay before starting a new antiretroviral treatment which included maraviroc. The primary endpoint was the 48 week proportion of patients with treatment success (TS). Intention-to-treat analyses are also reported. One hundred and fifty-five experienced patients were analysed: 77 patients in the Trofile arm and 78 in the Genotype arm. The 48-week proportion of TS was 87% in the Trofile arm and 89% in the Genotype arm (difference: 1.5%, 95%CI: -8.9% to 11.8%) suggesting non-inferiority. In the Trofile arm, 10 patients had treatment failure: 5 viral rebound, 5 discontinuations. In the Genotype arm, 9 patients had treatment failure: 7 viral rebound, 2 lost to follow-up. CD4+ significantly increased from baseline to week 48 in both arms. 48-week treatment success was similar for maraviroc-including therapy prescribed following the Trofile phenotypic assay or Geno2Pheno algorithm.",nonCancer
2409,The NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery for intellectual disabilities: three preliminary studies and future directions.,"Recent advances in understanding molecular and synaptic mechanisms of intellectual disabilities (ID) in fragile X syndrome (FXS) and Down syndrome (DS) through animal models have led to targeted controlled trials with pharmacological agents designed to normalize these underlying mechanisms and improve clinical outcomes. However, several human clinical trials have failed to demonstrate efficacy of these targeted treatments to improve surrogate behavioral endpoints. Because the ultimate index of disease modification in these disorders is amelioration of ID, the validation of cognitive measures for tracking treatment response is essential. Here, we present preliminary research to validate the National Institutes of Health Toolbox Cognitive Battery (NIH-TCB) for ID.|We completed three pilot studies of patients with FXS (total n = 63; mean age 19.3 ± 8.3 years, mean mental age 5.3 ± 1.6 years), DS (n = 47; mean age 16.1 ± 6.2, mean mental age 5.4 ± 2.0), and idiopathic ID (IID; n = 16; mean age 16.1 ± 5.0, mean mental age 6.6 ± 2.3) measuring processing speed, executive function, episodic memory, word/letter reading, receptive vocabulary, and working memory using the web-based NIH-TB-CB, addressing feasibility, test-retest reliability, construct validity, ecological validity, and syndrome differences and profiles.|Feasibility was good to excellent (≥80 % of participants with valid scores) for above mental age 4 years for all tests except list sorting (working memory). Test-retest stability was good to excellent, and convergent validity was similar to or better than results obtained from typically developing children in the normal sample for executive function and language measures. Examination of ecological validity revealed moderate to very strong correlations between the NIH-TCB composite and adaptive behavior and full-scale IQ measures. Syndrome/group comparisons demonstrated significant deficits for the FXS and DS groups relative to IID on attention and inhibitory control, a significant reading weakness for FXS, and a receptive vocabulary weakness for DS.|The NIH-TCB has potential for assessing important dimensions of cognition in persons with ID, and several tests may be useful for tracking response to intervention. However, more extensive psychometric studies, evaluation of the NIH-TCB's sensitivity to change, both developmentally and in the context of treatment, and perhaps establishing links to brain function in these populations, are required to determine the true utility of the battery as a set of outcome measures.",nonCancer
1718,Control of early HIV-1 infection associates with plasmacytoid DC-reactive opsonophagocytic IgG antibodies to HIV-1 p24.,"We have previously demonstrated that HIV-1 p24-specific plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-reactive opsonophagocytic antibody (PROAb) responses associate with control of chronic HIV infection. Here, we examined whether HIV-1 p24-specific PROAbs associate with control of early HIV infection and their relationship with HIV-1 p24-specific IgG subclasses.|Plasma collected at 8 and 52 weeks following primary HIV-1 infection was obtained from antiretroviral therapy-naive patients who were classified as 'good' (plasma HIV-1 RNA < 5,000 copies/mL; n = 17) or 'poor' (HIV-1 RNA >50,000 copies/mL; n = 15) controllers at week 52. HIV-1 p24-specific PROAb responses were assayed using a pDC cell line (Gen2.2) and HIV-1 p24-specific IgG3, IgG1 and IgG2 levels were assayed by ELISA.|HIV-1 p24-specific PROAb responses increased in 'good controllers' (p = 0.01) but remained unchanged in 'poor controllers' between weeks 8 and 52. Of the HIV-1 p24-specific IgG subclasses measured, only IgG1 increased over this time period in 'good controllers' alone (p = 0.003), which correlated with the increase in HIV-1 p24-specific PROAb responses (r = 0.83, p < 0.0001). Depletion of IgG1 from IgG preparations of 'good controllers' resulted in the inhibition of HIV-1 p24-specific PROAb responses. In the total patient cohort, plasma HIV-1 RNA levels at week 52 correlated inversely with changes in HIV-1 p24-specific PROAb responses (r = -0.37, p = 0.04) and IgG1 (r = -0.51, p = 0.003) levels between weeks 8 and 52.|Control of early HIV-1 infection was associated with an increase in HIV-1 p24-specific PROAb responses, which was mediated by HIV-1 p24-specific IgG1 Abs. These findings provide further evidence that antibodies to HIV core proteins may contribute to control of HIV-1 infection.",nonCancer

The monitoring of antimicrobial consumption from inpatient wards was performed from the pharmacy records and presented as defined daily dose (DDD) divided by the patient days and expressed as 100 bed-days (DBD).|The consumption of antimicrobials in 2012 was 171.3 DBD, and increased to 252.7 DBD in 2013, 229.1 DBD in 2014, and 184.7 DBD in 2015. Cephalosporins use reduced from 98.2 DBD in 2013 to 51.5 DBD in 2015 while the consumption of penicillins increased during the beginning of 2014 with a slight decrease in 2015. Carbapenems consumption during 2014-2015 was lower than previous years, and vice-versa for aminoglycosides. Fluoroquinolones had a sustained increase with 37.1% increased consumption in 2015 compared to the two previous years. There was an increase in the use of intravenous (IV) (108.5%) and oral azithromycin (55.1%) and the use of oral (152.8%) and IV moxifloxacin (22.9%).|We observed a decrease in antibiotic use in patients admitted to a community hospital with an antimicrobial stewardship program, but the increase in fluoroquinolones consumption is a concern that requires focused strategies.",nonCancer
135,Efficacy of the kinase inhibitor SU11248 against gastrointestinal stromal tumor mutants refractory to imatinib mesylate.,"The majority of gastrointestinal stromal tumors harbor mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinases KIT or platelet-derived growth factor receptor A (PDGFRA), and respond to treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib. Some tumors, however, show primary resistance to imatinib treatment, and most others become resistant during treatment. The most common mechanism of imatinib resistance involves specific mutations in the kinase domains of KIT or PDGFRA. We tested the activity of SU11248, an orally active small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor, to inhibit important imatinib-resistant KIT and PDGFRA mutants. Primary imatinib-resistant tumor cells and cell lines expressing clinically identified imatinib-resistant KIT-V654A, KIT-T670I, or PDGFRA-D842V mutant isoforms were evaluated for sensitivity to SU11248 by Western immunoblotting and proliferation assays. Three patients with the KIT-V654A mutation were treated with SU11248. Based on ex vivo assays, SU11248 potently inhibits KIT kinase activity of V654A and T670I mutants and suppresses proliferation of the cells expressing these mutations. Sensitivity of KIT-V654A and KIT-T670I mutants to SU11248 was confirmed using cell lines expressing these mutants. In contrast, SU11248 did not potently inhibit the PDGFRA-D842V mutant. In agreement with these results, two of the three imatinib-resistant patients with the KIT-V654A mutation responded to SU11248 treatment. These studies suggest that SU11248 may be a useful therapeutic agent to treat gastrointestinal stromal tumors harboring the imatinib-resistant KIT-V654A or KIT-T670I mutations, but it has no effect on the activity of the PDGFRA-D842V mutant. Specific kinase inhibitors should be designed to inhibit the constitutive activating PDGFRA mutation at codon 842.",cancer
967,"Additional mutations in SRSF2, ASXL1 and/or RUNX1 identify a high-risk group of patients with KIT D816V(+) advanced systemic mastocytosis.","Most patients with KIT D816V(+) advanced systemic mastocytosis (SM) are characterized by somatic mutations in additional genes. We sought to clarify the prognostic impact of such mutations. Genotype and clinical characteristics of 70 multi-mutated KIT D816V(+) advanced SM patients were included in univariate and multivariate analyses. The most frequently identified mutated genes were TET2 (n=33 of 70 patients), SRSF2 (n=30), ASXL1 (n=20), RUNX1 (n=16) and JAK2 (n=11). In univariate analysis, overall survival (OS) was adversely influenced by mutations in SRSF2 (P<0.0001), ASXL1 (P=0.002) and RUNX1 (P=0.03), but was not influenced by mutations in TET2 or JAK2. In multivariate analysis, SRSF2 and ASXL1 remained the most predictive adverse indicators concerning OS. Furthermore, we found that inferior OS and adverse clinical characteristics were significantly influenced by the number of mutated genes in the SRSF2/ASXL1/RUNX1 (S/A/R) panel (P<0.0001). In conclusion, the presence and number of mutated genes within the S/A/R panel are adversely associated with advanced disease and poor survival in KIT D816V(+) SM. On the basis of these findings, inclusion of molecular markers should be considered in upcoming prognostic scoring systems for patients with SM.",cancer
1803,Modelling Random Coincidences in Positron Emission Tomography by Using Singles and Prompts: A Comparison Study.,"Random coincidences degrade the image in Positron Emission Tomography, PET. To compensate for their degradation effects, the rate of random coincidences should be estimated. Under certain circumstances, current estimation methods fail to provide accurate results. We propose a novel method, ""Singles-Prompts"" (SP), that includes the information conveyed by prompt coincidences and models the pile-up. The SP method has the same structure than the well-known ""Singles Rate"" (SR) approach. Hence, SP can straightforwardly replace SR. In this work, the SP method has been extensively assessed and compared to two conventional methods, SR and the delayed window (DW) method, in a preclinical PET scenario using Monte-Carlo simulations. SP offers accurate estimates for the randoms rates, while SR and DW tend to overestimate the rates (∼10%, and 5%, respectively). With pile-up, the SP method is more robust than SR (but less than DW). At the image level, the contrast is overestimated in SR-corrected images, +16%, while SP produces the correct value. Spill-over is slightly reduced using SP instead of SR. The DW images values are similar to those of SP except for low-statistic scenarios, where DW behaves as if randoms were not compensated for. In particular, the contrast is reduced, -16%. In general, the better estimations of SP translate into better image quality.",nonCancer

Thus, identifying motivational factors affecting blood donation and recruitment of safe and low risk donors is necessary. For this reason, the study aimed at assessing knowledge, attitude, and practice towards blood donation and its associated factors.|A community based cross-sectional study was conducted in Debre Markos town from February to April, 2015. Multi-stage sampling technique was employed to recruit a total of 845 study participants. Interviewer administered questionnaire was employed as a data collection tool. Binary logistic regression was applied to assess the relationship between explanatory variables and outcome variables.|In this study, 436 (56.5 %) and 403 (52.2 %) were found to be knowledgeable and having favorable attitude, respectively, while the other 124 (16.1 %) reported to have the practice of blood donation. Younger age group, male sex, those who attended formal education and radio listener were significantly associated with the knowledge of blood donation. Attending secondary and above education, having higher income, listening to radio broadcasts, and knowledge of blood donation were found to be the independent predictors of attitude. The practice of blood donation was higher among respondents who were older, attended certificate and above education, knowledgeable, and favorable attitude groups.|The prevalence of knowledge and practice of blood donation is found to be higher compared to similar study conducted in Mekelle, whereas the level of attitude is found to be lower. The finding of this study also justified any possible interventions on the independent predictors. There should be a regularly scheduled awareness creation and voluntary blood donation campaigns organized at the community level to utilize potential blood donors.",nonCancer
698,Metformin and trametinib have synergistic effects on cell viability and tumor growth in NRAS mutant cancer.,"Attempts to directly block the mutant neuroblastoma rat sarcoma oncogene (NRAS) protein, a driving mutation in many cancer types, have been unsuccessful. Current treatments focus on inhibition of different components of NRAS' two main downstream cascades: PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAPK. Here we test a novel dual therapy combination of metformin and trametinib on a panel of 16 NRAS mutant cell lines, including melanoma cells, melanoma cells with acquired trametinib resistance, lung cancer and neuroblastoma cells. We show that both of the main downstream cascades of NRAS can be blocked by this combination: metformin indirectly inhibits the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and trametinib directly impedes the MAPK pathway. This dual therapy synergistically reduced cell viability in vitro and xenograft tumor growth in vivo. We conclude that metformin and trametinib combinations are effective in preclinical models and may be a possible option for treatment of NRAS mutant cancers.",cancer

650,Patients with colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability and large deletions in HSP110 T17 have improved response to 5-fluorouracil–based chemotherapy.,"Patients with colorectal tumors with microsatellite instability (MSI) have better prognoses than patients with tumors without MSI, but have a poor response to 5-fluorouracil–based chemotherapy. A dominant-negative form of heat shock protein (HSP)110 (HSP110DE9) expressed by cancer cells with MSI, via exon skipping caused by somatic deletions in the T(17) intron repeat, sensitizes the cells to 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin.We investigated whether HSP110 T(17) could be used to identify patients with colorectal cancer who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil and oxaliplatin. We characterized the interaction between HSP110 and HSP110DE9 using surface plasmon resonance. By using polymerase chain reaction and fragment analysis, we examined how the size of somatic allelic deletions in HSP110 T(17) affected the HSP110 protein expressed by tumor cells. We screened 329 consecutive patients with stage II–III colorectal tumors with MSI who underwent surgical resection at tertiary medical centers for HSP110 T(17). HSP110 and HSP110DE9 interacted in a1:1 ratio. Tumor cells with large deletions in T(17) had increased ratios of HSP110DE9:HSP110, owing to the loss of expression of full-length HSP110. Deletions in HSP110 T(17) were mostly biallelic in primary tumor samples with MSI. Patients with stage II–III cancer who received chemotherapy and had large HSP110 T(17) deletions (≥5 bp; 18 of 77 patients, 23.4%) had longer times of relapse-free survival than patients with small or no deletions (≤4 bp; 59 of 77 patients, 76.6%) in multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 0.16; 95% confidence interval, 0.012–0.8; P = .03). We found a significant interaction between chemotherapy and T17 deletion (P =.009). About 25% of patients with stages II–III colorectal tumors with MSI have an excellent response to chemotherapy, due to large, biallelic deletions in the T(17) intron repeat of HSP110 in tumor DNA.",cancer

1604,A novel seeding method of interfacial polymerization-assisted dip-coating for the preparation of zeolite NaA membranes on ceramic hollow fiber supports.,"A novel seeding method combining interfacial polymerization (IP) technique with dip-coating operation was designed for directly coating nano-sized NaA seed crystals (150nm) onto the micron-sized α-Al2O3 hollow fiber support, in which the polyamide (PA) produced by IP acted as effective medium to freeze and fix seed crystals at proper position and the controlled seed layer could be accomplished. While using the coating suspension with only 0.5wt.% seed content, a very thin seeds layer with high quality and good adhesion was achieved through dip-coating twice without drying between, and the whole seeding process was operated at ambient condition. The resulting zeolite NaA membranes not only exhibited high pervaporation (PV) performance with average separation factor above 10000 and flux nearly 9.0 kg/m2·h in dehydration of 90wt.% ethanol aqueous solution at 348K, but also demonstrated a great reproducibility with testing more than eight batches of zeolite membranes.

97,Frequency and distinctive spectrum of KRAS mutations in never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma.,"KRAS mutations are found in approximately 25% of lung adenocarcinomas in Western countries and, as a group, have been strongly associated with cigarette smoking. These mutations are predictive of poor prognosis in resected disease as well as resistance to treatment with erlotinib or gefitinib. We determined the frequency and type of KRAS codon 12 and 13 mutations and characterized their association with cigarette smoking history in patients with lung adenocarcinomas. KRAS mutational analysis was done on 482 lung adenocarcinomas, 81 (17%) of which were obtained from patients who had never smoked cigarettes. KRAS mutations were found in 15% (12 of 81; 95% confidence intervals, 8-24%) of tumors from never smokers. Similarly, 22% (69 of 316; 95% confidence intervals, 17-27%) of tumors from former smokers, and 25% (21 of 85; 95% confidence intervals, 16-35%) of tumors from current smokers had KRAS mutations. The frequency of KRAS mutation was not associated with age, gender, or smoking history. The number of pack years of cigarette smoking did not predict an increased likelihood of KRAS mutations. Never smokers were significantly more likely than former or current smokers to have a transition mutation (G-->A) rather than the transversion mutations known to be smoking-related (G-->T or G-->C; P < 0.0001). Based on our data, KRAS mutations are not rare among never smokers with lung adenocarcinoma and such patients have a distinct KRAS mutation profile. The etiologic and biological heterogeneity of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinomas is worthy of further study.",cancer

1063,Upregulation of AKT3 Confers Resistance to the AKT Inhibitor MK2206 in Breast Cancer.,"Acquired resistance to molecular targeted therapy represents a major challenge for the effective treatment of cancer. Hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT pathway is frequently observed in virtually all human malignancies, and numerous PI3K and AKT inhibitors are currently under clinical evaluation. However, mechanisms of acquired resistance to AKT inhibitors have yet to be described. Here, we use a breast cancer preclinical model to identify resistance mechanisms to a small molecule allosteric AKT inhibitor, MK2206. Using a step-wise and chronic high-dose exposure, breast cancer cell lines harboring oncogenic PI3K resistant to MK2206 were established. Using this model, we reveal that AKT3 expression is markedly upregulated in AKT inhibitor-resistant cells. Induction of AKT3 is regulated epigenetically by the bromodomain and extra terminal domain proteins. Importantly, knockdown of AKT3, but not AKT1 or AKT2, in resistant cells restores sensitivity to MK2206. AKT inhibitor-resistant cells also display an epithelial to mesenchymal transition phenotype as assessed by alterations in the levels of E-Cadherin, N-Cadherin, and vimentin, as well as enhanced invasiveness of tumor spheroids. Notably, the invasive morphology of resistant spheroids is diminished upon AKT3 depletion. We also show that resistance to MK2206 is reversible because upon drug removal resistant cells regain sensitivity to AKT inhibition, accompanied by reexpression of epithelial markers and reduction of AKT3 expression, implying that epigenetic reprogramming contributes to acquisition of resistance. These findings provide a rationale for developing therapeutics targeting AKT3 to circumvent acquired resistance in breast cancer. Mol Cancer Ther; 15(8); 1964-74. ©2016 AACR.",cancer
2498,Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein: A crucial component of vascular homeostasis.,"Endothelial subcellular structures, including caveolae, fenestrae and transendothelial channels, are crucial for regulating microvascular function. Plasmalemma vesicle-associated protein (PLVAP) is an endothelial cell-specific protein that forms the stomatal and fenestral diaphragms of blood vessels and regulates basal permeability, leukocyte migration and angiogenesis. Loss of PLVAP in mice leads to premature mortality due to disrupted homeostasis. Evidence from previous studies suggested that PLVAP is involved in cancer, traumatic spinal cord injury, acute ischemic brain disease, transplant glomerulopathy, Norrie disease and diabetic retinopathy. Specifically, PLVAP expression has been demonstrated to be upregulated in these diseases, accompanied by pro-angiogenic or pro-inflammatory responses. Therefore, PLVAP is considered a novel therapeutic target, in addition to an endothelial cell marker. The present review summarizes the structure and functions of PLVAP, and its roles in pathophysiological processes.",nonCancer
921,ATRX loss refines the classification of anaplastic gliomas and identifies a subgroup of IDH mutant astrocytic tumors with better prognosis.,"Mutation/loss of alpha-thalassemia/mental retardation syndrome X-linked (ATRX) expression has been described in anaplastic gliomas. The present study explored the role of ATRX status in the molecular classification of anaplastic gliomas and its impact on survival in the biomarker cohort of the NOA-04 anaplastic glioma trial. Patients (n = 133) of the NOA-04 trial were analyzed for ATRX expression using immunohistochemistry. ATRX status was correlated with age, histology, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), 1p/19q, alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) and O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status, and the trial efficacy endpoints. Loss of ATRX expression was detected in 45 % of anaplastic astrocytomas (AA), 27 % of anaplastic oligoastrocytomas (AOA) and 10 % of anaplastic oligodendrogliomas (AO). It was mostly restricted to IDH mutant tumors and almost mutually exclusive with 1p/19q co-deletion. The ALT phenotype was significantly correlated with ATRX loss. ATRX and 1p/19q status were used to re-classify AOA: AOA harboring ATRX loss shared a similar clinical course with AA, whereas AOA carrying 1p/19q co-deletion shared a similar course with AO. Accordingly, in a Cox regression model including ATRX and 1p/19q status, histology was no longer significantly associated with time to treatment failure. Survival analysis showed a marked separation of IDH mutant astrocytic tumors into two groups based on ATRX status: tumors with ATRX loss had a significantly better prognosis (median time to treatment failure 55.6 vs. 31.8 months, p = 0.0168, log rank test). ATRX status helps better define the clinically and morphologically mixed group of AOA, since ATRX loss is a hallmark of astrocytic tumors. Furthermore, ATRX loss defines a subgroup of astrocytic tumors with a favorable prognosis.",cancer
1142,The PIK3CA gene as a mutated target for cancer therapy.,"The development of targeted therapies with true specificity for cancer relies upon exploiting differences between cancerous and normal cells. Genetic and genomic alterations including somatic mutations, translocations, and amplifications have served as recent examples of how such differences can be exploited as effective drug targets. Small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies directed against the protein products of these genetic anomalies have led to cancer therapies with high specificity and relatively low toxicity. Recently, our group and others have demonstrated that somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene occur at high frequency in breast and other cancers. Moreover, the majority of mutations occur at three hotspots, making these ideal targets for therapeutic development. Here we review the literature on PIK3CA mutations in cancer, as well as existing data on PIK3CA inhibitors and inhibitors of downstream effectors for potential use as targeted cancer therapeutics.",cancer

1230,GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and survival in patients with sporadic colorectal cancer.,"Signaling via the G protein Galpha s pathway is linked to proapoptotic processes in cancer cell lines. We have recently shown an association between the GNAS1 T393C polymorphism and disease progression in patients with bladder cancer with homozygous TT genotypes displaying increased transcription of Galpha s and a more favorable clinical course compared with C-allele carriers. In the present study, 151 patients with sporadic colorectal cancer were retrospectively genotyped to examine a potential association between T393C genotypes and survival. Moreover, two other single-nucleotide polymorphisms in common haplotype blocks within the gene GNAS1 and their interaction with the T393C polymorphism were investigated. The allele frequency in the patients group was not significantly different from that of healthy blood donors. Kaplan-Meier curves for overall survival (mean follow-up, 43 months) showed that in International Union Against Cancer (UICC) stages I to II, the 5-year survival rate was significantly higher in TT genotypes (87.8%) compared with TC (71.0%) and CC genotypes (50.0%; P = 0.009), whereas no genotype effect could be observed for UICC stages III to IV. In multivariate Cox proportional analysis the T393C polymorphism was an independent prognostic factor for survival. Homozygous CC patients were at highest risk for death (hazard ratio, 12.1; P = 0.006) compared with TT genotypes. Heterozygous patients had an intermediate risk compatible with a gene-dose effect. The two haplotype blocks investigated were not associated with clinical outcome. The results support the role of the T393C polymorphism as a marker for survival in patients with colorectal cancer stages I to II and in the identification of patients who may benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",cancer
761,A novel acquired ALK F1245C mutation confers resistance to crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC but is sensitive to ceritinib.,The emergence of acquired anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) resistant mutations is a common molecular mechanism underpinning disease progression during crizotinib treatment of ALK-positive (ALK+) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Identifying acquired resistance mutations in ALK is paramount for tailoring future therapy with second generation ALK inhibitors and beyond. Comprehensive genomic profiling using hybrid-capture next generation sequencing has been successful in identifying acquired ALK resistance mutations. Here we described the emergence of an ALK F1245C mutation in an advanced ALK+ NSCLC patient (EML4-ALK variant 3a/b) who developed slow disease progression after a durable response to crizotinib. The patient was eventually switched to ceritinib with on-going clinical response. This is the first patient report that ALK F1245C is an acquired resistance mutation to crizotinib that can be overcome by ceritinib.,cancer
92,Wilms tumor 1 gene mutations are associated with a higher risk of recurrence in young adults with acute myeloid leukemia: a study from the Acute Leukemia French Association.,"Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in most acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). Recently, 2 groups reported that WT1 mutations occur in approximately 10% of normal karyotype AMLs and are an independent predictor of poor outcome in this subgroup of patients with AML. The authors studied a cohort of 268 young adults (ages 15-50 years) with AML who were treated on the Acute Leukemia French Association 9802 trial. WT1 exon 7 and 9 mutations were screened retrospectively by polymerase chain reaction and direct sequencing. The patients also were assessed for the presence of the fms-related tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD), FLT3-D835/I836, nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1), and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (CEBPA) mutations. WT1 mutations were identified in 14 patients (5%) and were associated with a younger age (P = .02) and an FLT3-ITD (P = .03). No mutation was detected in patients who had favorable cytogenetics. Patients who had WT1 mutations had a shorter overall survival at 4 years (22% vs 56%; P = .01) and a higher risk of recurrence at 4 years (82% vs 46%; P = .0008) compared with patients who had wild-type WT1. Within the subgroup of patients who had normal karyotype AML (n = 106), WT1 mutation was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor for the risk of recurrence. The current results indicted that WT1 mutations represent an adverse prognostic factor in young adults with AML. Prospective trials should confirm the clinical relevance of WT1 mutations in relation to other prognostic factors in patients with AML.",cancer
1705,Ferroelectric surface induced electron doping in a zigzag graphene nanoribbon.,"The interface between a zigzag graphene nanoribbon (zGNR) and the ferroelectric PbTiO3 (0 0 1) surface is studied through first-principles calculations. We investigate how the electric polarization normal to the surface tunes the zGNR electronic and magnetic properties. A ferroelectric single-domain configuration with polarization up and down is considered including explicitly a bottom metallic electrode. Our results show how not only the ferroelectric polarization direction determines the doping in zGNR-the downward polarization induces a p-type doping in a planar zGNR whereas the upward polarization keeps it intrinsic-but also the features of the clean ferroelectric surface, such as the atomic relaxation and the electronic distribution. Interestingly, the surface ferroelectric polarization, besides tuning the carrier type as it does in graphene, also closes the zGNR band gap which can be understood in terms of the weakening of the local magnetic moment of the edge carbon atoms as the polarization increases. The zGNR antiferromagnetic ground state is preserved without breaking the α-β degeneracy.",nonCancer
552,"Preoperative chemotherapy plus trastuzumab, lapatinib, or both in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive operable breast cancer: results of the randomized phase II CHER-LOB study.","This is a noncomparative, randomized, phase II trial of preoperative taxane-anthracycline in combination with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or combined trastuzumab plus lapatinib in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive, stage II to IIIA operable breast cancer. The primary aim was to estimate the percentage of pathologic complete response (pCR; no invasive tumor in breast and axillary nodes). In the three arms, chemotherapy consisted of weekly paclitaxel (80 mg/m(2)) for 12 weeks followed by fluorouracil, epirubicin, and cyclophosphamide for four courses every 3 weeks. The patients randomly assigned to arm A received a 4-mg loading dose of trastuzumab followed by 2 mg weekly; in arm B patients received lapatinib 1,500 mg orally (PO) daily; and in arm C, patients received trastuzumab and lapatinib 1,000 mg PO daily. A total of 121 patients were randomly assigned. Diarrhea and dermatologic and hepatic toxicities were observed more frequently in patients receiving lapatinib. No episodes of congestive heart failure were observed. The rates of breast-conserving surgery were 66.7%, 57.9%, and 68.9% in arms A, B and C, respectively. The pCR rates were 25% (90% CI, 13.1% to 36.9%) in arm A, 26.3% (90% CI, 14.5% to 38.1%) in arm B, and 46.7% (90% CI, 34.4% to 58.9%) in arm C (exploratory P = .019). The primary end point of the study was met, with a relative increase of 80% in the pCR rate achieved with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab and lapatinib compared with chemotherapy plus either trastuzumab or lapatinib. These data add further evidence supporting the superiority of a dual-HER2 inhibition for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.",cancer
251,p53 genotype predicts response to chemotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.,"Response to chemotherapy and anatomical spread are significant prognostic factors in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) treated by chemotherapy then surgery. Predicting the response to chemotherapy would allow significant optimization of cancer treatment. Genomic mutation and protein expression of p53 were investigated retrospectively by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) using biopsy specimens from 77 ESCC patients before chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, and cisplatin. p53 status was correlated with various clinicopathological factors. Thereafter, we performed a prospective study of 20 consecutive patients to test our prediction model. The retrospective study showed mutant p53 genotype and positive p53 IHC staining in 46.8 and 55.8% of patients, respectively, which was not associated with patient's clinicopathological findings including initial tumor stage. Objective response to chemotherapy was observed in 65.9% of patients with wild genotype, but in only 16.7% of patients with mutant genotype. Patients with mutations in p53 therefore showed significantly poorer prognosis than those without mutant p53. In contrast, p53 IHC staining did not correlate with response to chemotherapy, curative resection rate or prognosis. In the prospective study, p53 mutation was seen in 50% (10/20) of patients and was again consistently associated with poorer response to chemotherapy and poorer prognosis. p53 genotype of pretreatment biopsy is a potentially useful predictor of response to chemotherapy and prognosis in ESCC patients. This information might be valuable to clinicians in deciding on the optimal clinical strategy in patients with ESCC.",cancer
2024,Cytoskeleton-centric protein transportation by exosomes transforms tumor-favorable macrophages.,"The exosome is a key initiator of pre-metastatic niche in numerous cancers, where macrophages serve as primary inducers of tumor microenvironment. However, the proteome that can be exosomally transported from cancer cells to macrophages has not been sufficiently characterized so far. Here, we used colorectal cancer (CRC) exosomes to educate tumor-favorable macrophages. With a SILAC-based mass spectrometry strategy, we successfully traced the proteome transported from CRC exosomes to macrophages. Such a proteome primarily focused on promoting cytoskeleton rearrangement, which was biologically validated with multiple cell lines. We reproduced the exosomal transportation of functional vimentin as a proof-of-concept example. In addition, we found that some CRC exosomes could be recognized by macrophages via Fc receptors. Therefore, we revealed the active and necessary role of exosomes secreted from CRC cells to transform cancer-favorable macrophages, with the cytoskeleton-centric proteins serving as the top functional unit.",nonCancer
1615,A predictive model for carcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis B undergoing entecavir therapy and its validation.,"We created a model to predict the development of liver carcinogenesis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) undergoing entecavir (ETV) therapy and to validate the accuracy using an independent dataset.A total of 328 CHB subjects were analyzed. Subjects were randomly assigned into 2 groups: the training group (n = 164) and the validation group (n = 164). Using data from the training group, we built a predictive model for liver carcinogenesis by performing univariate and multivariate analyses using variables associated with liver carcinogenesis. We subsequently assessed the applicability of the constructed model in the validation group.The median (range) follow-up periods in the training and the validation groups were 5.03 years (1.03-9.98) and 4.84 years (1.10-9.97), respectively. The proportion of hepatitis B virus-DNA at 24 weeks <1.9 log IU/mL in the training group was 70.7% (116/164), while that in the validation group was 71.3% (117/164). For the entire cohort (n = 328), the median alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) value at 24 weeks (3.45 ng/mL; range, 0.9-102.7 ng/mL) significantly decreased compared to the baseline values (5.55 ng/mL; range, 0.9-1039.5 ng/mL), while the median alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value at 24 weeks (24 IU/mL; range, 6-251 IU/mL) also significantly decreased compared to baseline values (57 IU/mL; range, 7-1450 IU/mL). During the observation period, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) developed in 15 (9.1%) patients in the training group and in 17 (10.4%) patients in the validation group. The 3- and 5-year cumulative HCC incidence rates in the entire cohort were 4.48% and 9.52%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis of the training group, age ≥54 years (P = 0.0273), ALT level at 24 weeks (P = 0.0456), and AFP at 24 weeks (P = 0.0485) were found to be significant predictors linked to HCC. Using these independent predictors, the risk for HCC development was well stratified in the validation group (overall significance, P < 0.0001). Similar results were observed in subgroup analyses of patients with or without cirrhosis and HBe antigen positivity.In conclusion, our predictive model was well verified; hence, it may be a promising model for the prediction of the development of liver carcinogenesis in CHB patients undergoing ETV therapy.",nonCancer
1539,"Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Monitoring, Superior Vena Cava Flow, and Neurodevelopmental Outcome at 2 years in a Cohort of Very Low-Birth-Weight Infants.","Objective We aimed at assessing the association between superior vena cava flow (SVCf), regional (cerebral) tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2), and cerebral fractional oxygen extraction (CFOE) during the first 48 hours of life and 2-years neurodevelopmental outcome of very low-birth-weight infants (VLBW). Methods We prospectively studied 60 VLBW infants admitted to our neonatal intensive care unit; rSO2 was continuously monitored with near-infrared spectroscopy during the first 48 hours of life, SVCf was measured at 4 to 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, and CFOE was calculated. Neurodevelopmental outcome was assessed at 24 months corrected age. Results The mean gestational age at birth was 27.9 weeks (standard deviation: 2.4); 8 infants died in the first 3 months of life, 6 were lost to follow-up, 46 survived and were followed up. At 24 months, 6 (13%) and 7 (15.2%) infants developed minor and major sequelae, respectively. Infants who died had higher CFOE (p < 0.001) and lower SVCf (p < 0.001) than infants surviving with sequelae. In turn, these had higher SVCf between 24 and 48 hours than those without sequelae (p < 0.001). Conclusion SVCf, rSO2, and CFOE patterns in the first days of life suggest cerebral hyperperfusion, related to loss of autoregulation and/or use of inotropic drugs, as a potential mechanism of cerebral injury.",nonCancer
22,KRAS mutations and primary resistance of lung adenocarcinomas to gefitinib or erlotinib.,"Somatic mutations in the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are found in adenocarcinomas of the lung and are associated with sensitivity to the kinase inhibitors gefitinib (Iressa) and erlotinib (Tarceva). Lung adenocarcinomas also harbor activating mutations in the downstream GTPase, KRAS, and mutations in EGFR and KRAS appear to be mutually exclusive. We sought to determine whether mutations in KRAS could be used to further enhance prediction of response to gefitinib or erlotinib. We screened 60 lung adenocarcinomas defined as sensitive or refractory to gefitinib or erlotinib for mutations in EGFR and KRAS. We show that mutations in KRAS are associated with a lack of sensitivity to either drug. Our results suggest that treatment decisions regarding use of these kinase inhibitors might be improved by determining the mutational status of both EGFR and KRAS.",cancer

Patients with end-stage cancer lose self-efficacy associated with reduced activities of daily life (ADL). Herein, we report a case of end-stage cancer in which self-efficacy was enhanced as the patient gained self-control of prodromal symptoms of syncope.|A 70-year-old patient with end-stage esophageal cancer and enlarged supraclavicular lymph nodes developed CSS. The CSS was a mixed type with both bradycardia and decreased blood pressure, accompanied by prodromal symptoms prior to syncope episodes. The patient incidentally discovered that he could decrease the duration of symptoms by contracting the muscles in his hands and legs. By applying this coping method at the onset of prodromal symptoms, he was also able to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, which resulted in enhanced self-efficacy. As a result, the frequency of prodromal symptoms also decreased even though ADL improved.|This patient was diagnosed with vasoinhibitory-predominant mixed-type CSS. The coping method the patient developed seemed to avoid the onset of abrupt blood pressure decrease via peripheral vascular constriction action. Achievement of adequate coping such as self-control of prodromal symptoms enabled our patient to improve his self-efficacy even at the end stages of cancer. This case of enhanced self-efficacy could possibly illustrate a placebo effect for prevention of recurrence.",nonCancer

To improve our understanding of these host-parasite relationships we conducted parasitological evaluations of the deep-water Haifa grouper Hyporthodus haifensis from the southern Mediterranean off Tunisia and Libya. We collected more than one species of diplectanid monogeneans from this host, but among these only one dominant species was abundant. This proved to be morphologically very similar to Pseudorhabdosynochus sulamericanus Santos, Buchmann & Gibson, 2000, a species originally described from the congeneric host H. niveatus off Brazil and also recorded from H. niveatus and H. nigritus off Florida. Here, we conducted a morphological comparison between newly collected specimens and those previously deposited in museum collections by other authors. Further, we used COI barcoding to ascertain the specific identity of the three host species to better elucidate the circumstances that might explain the unexpectedly broad distribution of P. sulamericanus. We assigned our specimens from H. haifensis to P. sulamericanus primarily on the basis of morphological characteristics of the sclerotized vagina. We also noted morphological characteristics of eastern and western Atlantic specimens that are not clearly described or not given in previous descriptions and so prepared a redescription of the species. We confirmed, by COI barcoding, that no sister-species relationships were evident among the three hosts of P. sulamericanus. Our observation that P. sulamericanus infects unrelated host species with putatively allopatric distributions was unexpected given the very limited dispersive capabilities and the high degree of host specificity common to members of Pseudorhabdosynochus. This transatlantic distribution raises questions with regard to phylogeography and assumptions about the allopatry of Atlantic grouper species from the Americas and Afro-Eurasia. Here, we propose some hypothetical explanations for our findings.",nonCancer
8,Pharmacodynamic effects and mechanisms of resistance to vemurafenib in patients with metastatic melanoma.,"PURPOSE To assess pharmacodynamic effects and intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms of the BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in BRAF(V600)-mutant melanoma, leading to an understanding of the mechanism of action of vemurafenib and ultimately to optimization of metastatic melanoma therapy. METHODS In the phase II clinical study NP22657 (BRIM-2), patients received oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice per day). Serial biopsies were collected to study changes in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, cell-cycle progression, and factors causing intrinsic or acquired resistance by immunohistochemistry, DNA sequencing, or somatic mutation profiling. Results Vemurafenib inhibited MAPK signaling and cell-cycle progression. An association between the decrease in extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and objective response was observed in paired biopsies (n = 22; P = .013). Low expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog showed a modest association with lower response. Baseline mutations in MEK1(P124) coexisting with BRAF(V600) were noted in seven of 92 samples; their presence did not preclude objective tumor responses. Acquired resistance to vemurafenib associated with reactivation of MAPK signaling as observed by elevated ERK1/2 phosphorylation levels in progressive lesions and the appearance of secondary NRAS(Q61) mutations or MEK1(Q56P) or MEK1(E203K) mutations. These two activating MEK1 mutations had not previously been observed in vivo in biopsies of progressive melanoma tumors. CONCLUSION Vemurafenib inhibits tumor proliferation and oncogenic BRAF signaling through the MAPK pathway. Acquired resistance results primarily from MAPK reactivation driven by the appearance of secondary mutations in NRAS and MEK1 in subsets of patients. The data suggest that inhibition downstream of BRAF should help to overcome acquired resistance.",cancer
581,Favorable response to trastuzumab plus irinotecan combination therapy in two patients with HER2-positive relapsed small-cell lung cancer.,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) easily recurs with multidrug resistance phenotype. However, standard therapeutic strategies for relapsed-SCLC remain unestablished. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression correlates with poor prognosis in extensive disease-SCLC. We have reported previously that HER2 expression is upregulated when HER2-positive SCLC cells acquire chemoresistance, and also demonstrated that trastuzumab exerts significant antitumor activity toward HER2-upregulated chemoresistant SCLC, mainly via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity mechanism. Based on these preclinical data, we treated two patients with HER2-positive SCLC by combination of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg, day 1) and irinotecan (80 mg/m(2), days 1 and 8) every 21 days as the third-line chemotherapy following two prior regimens, first-line carboplatin plus etoposide and second-line amrubicin. One patient achieved partial response after the first cycle and received 6 cycles in total without disease progression for 4.5 months. The other also received 4 cycles and kept stable disease for 3.5 months. This treatment can be continued safely at an outpatient clinic without any severe adverse event. In conclusion, trastuzumab plus irinotecan chemotherapy is promising and feasible against HER2-positive relapsed SCLC. Further clinical studies are encouraged to confirm the antitumor efficacy of trastuzumab in SCLC.",cancer
25,ALK mutations conferring differential resistance to structurally diverse ALK inhibitors.,"EML4-ALK fusions define a subset of lung cancers that can be effectively treated with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors. Unfortunately, the duration of response is heterogeneous and acquired resistance limits their ultimate efficacy. Thus, a better understanding of resistance mechanisms will help to enhance tumor control in EML4-ALK-positive tumors. By applying orthogonal functional mutagenesis screening approaches, we screened for mutations inducing resistance to the aminopyridine PF02341066 (crizotinib) and/or the diaminopyrimidine TAE684. Here, we show that the resistance mutation, L1196M, as well as other crizotinib resistance mutations (F1174L and G1269S), are highly sensitive to the structurally unrelated ALK inhibitor TAE684. In addition, we identified two novel EML4-ALK resistance mutations (L1198P and D1203N), which unlike previously reported mutations, induced resistance to both ALK inhibitors. An independent resistance screen in ALK-mutant neuroblastoma cells yielded the same L1198P resistance mutation but defined two additional mutations conferring resistance to TAE684 but not to PF02341066. Our results show that different ALK resistance mutations as well as different ALK inhibitors impact the therapeutic efficacy in the setting of EML4-ALK fusions and ALK mutations.",cancer
1154,Mutant V599EB-Raf regulates growth and vascular development of malignant melanoma tumors.,"Activating mutations of the B-RAF gene are observed in >60% of human melanomas. Approximately 90% of these mutations occur in the activation segment of the kinase domain as a single-base substitution that converts a valine to glutamic acid at codon 599 (V599E) in exon 15. This mutation causes activation of the kinase as well as downstream effectors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling cascade, leading to melanoma tumor development by an as yet unknown mechanism. In this study, we have identified the role of (V599E)B-Raf in melanoma tumor development by characterizing the mechanism by which this mutant protein promotes melanoma tumorigenesis. Small interfering RNA targeted against B-Raf or a Raf kinase inhibitor (BAY 43-9006) was used to reduce expression and/or activity of (V599E)B-Raf in melanoma tumors. This inhibition led to reduced activity of the mitogen-activated protein kinase-signaling cascade and inhibited tumor development in animals. Targeted reduction of mutant (V599E)B-Raf expression (activity) in melanoma cells before tumor formation inhibited tumorigenesis by reducing the growth potential of melanoma cells. In contrast, reduction of mutant (V599E)B-Raf activity in preexisting tumors prevented further vascular development mediated through decreased vascular endothelial growth factor secretion, subsequently increasing apoptosis in tumors. These effects in combination with reduced proliferative capacity halted growth, but did not shrink the size of preexisting melanoma tumors. Thus, these studies identify the mechanistic underpinnings by which mutant (V599E)B-RAF promotes melanoma development and show the effectiveness of targeting this protein to inhibit melanoma tumor growth.",cancer
1400,"Evolutionary Expansion of WRKY Gene Family in Banana and Its Expression Profile during the Infection of Root Lesion Nematode, Pratylenchus coffeae.","The WRKY family of transcription factors orchestrate the reprogrammed expression of the complex network of defense genes at various biotic and abiotic stresses. Within the last 96 million years, three rounds of Musa polyploidization events had occurred from selective pressure causing duplication of MusaWRKYs with new activities. Here, we identified a total of 153 WRKY transcription factors available from the DH Pahang genome. Based on their phylogenetic relationship, the MusaWRKYs available with complete gene sequence were classified into the seven common WRKY sub-groups. Synteny analyses data revealed paralogous relationships, with 17 MusaWRKY gene pairs originating from the duplication events that had occurred within the Musa lineage. We also found 15 other MusaWRKY gene pairs originating from much older duplication events that had occurred along Arecales and Poales lineage of commelinids. Based on the synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates, the fate of duplicated MusaWRKY genes was predicted to have undergone sub-functionalization in which the duplicated gene copies retain a subset of the ancestral gene function. Also, to understand the regulatory roles of MusaWRKY during a biotic stress, Illumina sequencing was performed on resistant and susceptible cultivars during the infection of root lesion nematode, Pratylenchus coffeae. The differential WRKY gene expression analysis in nematode resistant and susceptible cultivars during challenged and unchallenged conditions had distinguished: 1) MusaWRKYs participating in general banana defense mechanism against P.coffeae common to both susceptible and resistant cultivars, 2) MusaWRKYs that may aid in the pathogen survival as suppressors of plant triggered immunity, 3) MusaWRKYs that may aid in the host defense as activators of plant triggered immunity and 4) cultivar specific MusaWRKY regulation. Mainly, MusaWRKY52, -69 and -92 are found to be P.coffeae specific and can act as activators or repressors in a defense pathway. Overall, this preliminary study in Musa provides the basis for understanding the evolution and regulatory mechanism of MusaWRKY during nematode stress.",nonCancer

To further study the fundamentals and importance of heterogeneity of cell functions and its potential mechanisms, we performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on human squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder (SCCB) and its corresponding physiologically normal epithelia. Extensive differentially expressed genes were uncovered by comparing cancer and normal single cells, which were preferentially enriched in cancer-correlated pathways, such as p53 signaling and bladder cancer pathway. Furthermore, the most diversely expressed genes were particularly enriched in MAPK signaling pathway, such as CACNG4, CACNA1E and CACNA1H, which involve in cancer evolution and heterogeneity formation. Co-expression network and hub-gene analyses revealed several remarkable ""hub genes"" of each regulatory module. Some of them are cancer related, such as POU2F3, NKD1 and CYP2C8, while LINC00189, GCC2 and OR9Q1 genes are rarely reported in human diseases. The genes within an interesting module are highly correlated with others, which could be treated as potential targets for SCCB patients.

1784,Lipoic Acid in the Prevention of Acute Kidney Injury.,"Hypoxia, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and oxidative stress contribute to contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) and ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) in the kidney and heart. Imbalance between the increased formation of ROS by hypoxia in the cardiac and renal tissue and the low availability of endogenous antioxidants is a common cause of cellular and tissue damage. Therefore, a strategy to inhibit ROS generation or to scavenger free radicals becomes an important intervention to prevent CI-AKI and myocardial IRI. Evidence has shown that a naturally occurring cellular antioxidant lipoic acid (LA) (1,2-dithilane-3-pentanoic acid) acts as a free radical scavenger of ROS and reactive nitrogen oxide species for cardioprotection and renoprotection. The mechanisms whereby LA exerts its protective effects are not entirely understood, but may be related to the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/Nrf2 pathway and the PI3-kinase/Akt pathways. This review will provide the current information of LA as an exogenous antioxidant for cardioprotection and renoprotection, with emphasis on antioxidant functions of LA and multiple signaling pathways underlying protective effects of LA on CI-AKI as well as cardiac and renal IRI.",nonCancer

Varying reagent concentrations allowed us to optimize the sequence of reactions for product formation. The electronically excited ruthenium complex (*Ru) reacts first with ArN2BF4 to produce a ruthenium(III) (Ru(III)) intermediate, triggering a subsequent reaction with Br(-). Transient absorption measured at 486 and 380 nm provides insight into the time-dependent concentrations of *Ru, Ru(III), and Br2(•-). Without interference of back-electron transfer, the rate constant for an equal concentration bimolecular reaction of Br2(•-) was determined to be 5 × 10(9) M(-1) s(-1).

210,Comprehensive molecular characterization of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.,"Genetic changes underlying clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) include alterations in genes controlling cellular oxygen sensing (for example, VHL) and the maintenance of chromatin states (for example, PBRM1). We surveyed more than 400 tumours using different genomic platforms and identified 19 significantly mutated genes. The PI(3)K/AKT pathway was recurrently mutated, suggesting this pathway as a potential therapeutic target. Widespread DNA hypomethylation was associated with mutation of the H3K36 methyltransferase SETD2, and integrative analysis suggested that mutations involving the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex (PBRM1, ARID1A, SMARCA4) could have far-reaching effects on other pathways. Aggressive cancers demonstrated evidence of a metabolic shift, involving downregulation of genes involved in the TCA cycle, decreased AMPK and PTEN protein levels, upregulation of the pentose phosphate pathway and the glutamine transporter genes, increased acetyl-CoA carboxylase protein, and altered promoter methylation of miR-21 (also known as MIR21) and GRB10.

Delayed sciatic nerve injury is a rare complication after THA that requires prompt diagnosis and management.|We present a case of sciatic nerve motor and sensory deficit in a 52-year-old patient 2 years after index left THA. Electromyography (EMG) results and imaging with radiographs and CT of the affected hip demonstrated an aberrant acetabular cup screw in the posterior-inferior quadrant adjacent to the sciatic nerve.|The patient underwent surgical exploration that revealed injury to the peroneal division of the sciatic nerve due to direct injury from screw impingement. A literature review identified 11 patients with late-onset neuropathy after THA. Ten patients underwent surgical exploration and pain often resolved after surgery with 56% of patients recovering sensory function and 25% experiencing full recovery of motor function.|Delayed neuropathy of the sciatic nerve is a rare complication after THA that is most often due to hardware irritation, component failure, or wear-related pseudotumor formation. Operative intervention is often pursued to explore and directly visualize the nerve with limited results in the literature showing modest relief of pain and sensory symptoms and poor restoration of motor function.",nonCancer
2204,Comparison of two molecular assays for detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in whole blood and plasma samples from transplant recipients.,"In immunosuppressed patients, pre-emptive therapy and a strict follow-up of CMV infection are the standard of care for the prevention of CMV disease. Several real-time PCR assays for CMV DNA quantification on whole blood (WB) and plasma (PL) are commercially available. This study compared and correlated CMV viral loads obtained by the Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan (CAP/CTM) platform on plasma specimens with those obtained on corresponding whole blood specimens by the real-time PCR assay (ELITe MGB-CMV) in 185 sequential samples from 41 immunosuppressed patients. Correlation between the two assays was good. Kinetics of CMV DNA within the same patient was similar, but PL viral load was constantly 1 log lower than WB. In patients under antiviral therapy, low level of CMV DNA persisted in WB, while it was absent in PL. The good correlation between CMV DNA detected on both PL and WB supports the reliability of the two matrices for viral monitoring and the therapeutic management of CMV infection. Nevertheless, due to significant quantification differences between PL and WB CMV DNA, the same biological specimen should be used for a sequential and reliable follow-up of patients at high risk of CMV infection.",nonCancer
2304,An optimized approach to germ-free rearing in the jewel wasp Nasonia.,"Development of a Nasonia in vitrogerm-free rearing system in 2012 enabled investigation of Nasonia-microbiota interactions and real-time visualization of parasitoid metamorphosis. However, the use of antibiotics, bleach, and fetal bovine serum introduced artifacts relative to conventional rearing of Nasonia. Here, we optimize the germ-free rearing procedure by using filter sterilization in lieu of antibiotics and by removing residual bleach and fetal bovine serum. Comparison of these methods reveals no influence on larval survival or growth, and a 52% improvement in adult production. Additionally, adult males produced in the new germ-free system are similar in size to conventionally reared males. Experimental implications of these changes are discussed.",nonCancer
664,Reduced miRNA-218 expression in pancreatic cancer patients as a predictor of poor prognosis.,"microRNA-218 (miR-218) is a vertebrate-specific miRNA that plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and tumor progression. This study analyzed the miR-218 expression level and clinical significance in pancreatic cancer. One hundred and seven pairs of pancreatic cancer and adjacent normal tissues were analyzed by quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between miR-218 expression and clinicopathological characters was determined by the two-sample Student t-test. The survival correlations were analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model. The relative expression of miR-218 in pancreatic cancer tissues (2.63 ± 1.59) was significantly lower than that in matched noncancerous pancreatic tissues (6.52 ± 2.50, P < 0.001). The low expression of miR-218 in the pancreatic cancer tissues were strongly correlated with the TNM classification (P = 0.02), distant metastasis (P = 0.001), and tumor differentiation (P = 0.003). The low level of miR-218 expression was significantly correlated with the shorter overall survival time of pancreatic cancer patients (5-year overall survival rate: 7.5 vs 34.9%; log-rank test: P < 0.001). Multivariate analyses confirmed that a low level of miR-218 expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in pancreatic cancer patients (Hazard ratio: 7.24; 95% confidence interval: 2.01-18.28; P = 0.007). Our findings suggested a significant downregulation in the expression of miR-218; this might have considerable potential value in the prognosis for pancreatic cancer.",cancer
2187,Hyphenating Centrifugal Partition Chromatography with Nuclear Magnetic Resonance through automated Solid Phase Extraction.,"Centrifugal Partition Chromatography (CPC) and all Countercurrent Separation apparatus provide chemists with efficient ways to work with complex matrices, especially in the domain of Natural Products. However, despite the great advances provided by these techniques, more efficient ways of analyzing the output flow would bring further enhancement. This study describe a hyphenated approach made by coupling NMR with CPC through a hybrid-indirect coupling made possible by using a SPE apparatus intended for HPLC-NMR hyphenation. Some hardware changes were needed to adapt the incompatible flow-rates and a reverse-engineering approach that led to the specific software required to control the apparatus. 1D 1HNMR and 1H-1H COSY spectra were acquired in reasonable time without the need for any solvent-suppression method thanks to the SPE nitrogen drying step. The reduced usage of expensive deuterated solvents from several hundreds of milliliters to the milliliter order is the major improvement of this approach compared to the previously published ones.",nonCancer
1963,Automated control of endotracheal tube cuff pressure during simulated flight.,"Successful mechanical ventilation requires that the airway be controlled by an endotracheal tube (ETT) with an inflatable cuff to seal the airway. Aeromedical evacuation represents a unique challenge in which to manage ETT cuffs. We evaluated three methods of automatic ETT cuff pressure adjustment during changes in altitude in an altitude chamber.|Size 7.5- and 8.0-mm ETTs that are currently included in the Critical Care Air Transport Team allowance standard were used for the evaluation. Three automatic cuff pressure controllers-Intellicuff, Hamilton Medical; Pyton, ARM Medical; Cuff Sentry, Outcome Solutions-were used to manage cuff pressures. The fourth group had cuff pressure set at sea level without further adjustment. Each ETT was inserted into a tracheal model and taken to 8,000 feet and then to 16,000 feet at 2,500 ft/min. Baseline cuff pressure at sea level was approximately 25 cm H2O.|Mean cuff pressure at both altitudes with both size ETTs: Control arm 141 ± 64 cm H2O; Pyton 25 ± 0.8 cm H2O; Cuff Sentry 22 ± 0.3 cm H2O; Intellicuff 29 ± 6.6 cm H2O. The mean time that cuff pressure was > 30 cm H2O using Intellicuff at both altitudes was 2.8 ± 0.8 minutes. Pressure differences from baseline in the control arm and with Intellicuff were statistically significant. Cuff pressure with the Cuff Sentry tended to be lower than indicated on the device.|Mean cuff pressures were within the recommended range with all three devices. Intellicuff had difficulty regulating the cuff pressure initially with increases in altitude but was able to reduce the pressure to a safe level during the stabilization period at each altitude. The Pyton and Cuff Sentry allowed the least variation in pressure throughout the evaluation, although the Cuff Sentry set pressure was less than actual pressure.",nonCancer
1643,Polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid for bowel preparation in chronic kidney disease.,"The safety of polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid has not been fully investigated in patients with renal insufficiency. High-dose ascorbic acid could induce hyperoxaluria, thereby causing tubule-interstitial nephritis and renal failure. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid in patients with chronic kidney disease.We retrospectively reviewed prospectively collected data on colonoscopy in patients with impaired renal function. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 2 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid (n = 61) and 4 L polyethylene glycol (n = 80). The safety of the 2 groups was compared by assessing the differences in laboratory findings before and after bowel cleansing.The laboratory findings were not significantly different before and after the administration of 2 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid or 4 L polyethylene glycol. In both groups, the estimated glomerular filtration rate was not influenced by the administration of the bowel-cleansing agent. Patients' reports on tolerance and acceptability were better in the 2 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid group than in the 4 L polyethylene glycol group.The 2 L polyethylene glycol plus ascorbic acid solution is a safe choice for bowel preparation before colonoscopy in patients with impaired renal function.",nonCancer
1056,ATM deficiency sensitizes mantle cell lymphoma cells to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 inhibitors.,"Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibition is toxic to cells with mutations in the breast and ovarian cancer susceptibility genes BRCA1 or BRCA2, a concept termed synthetic lethality. However, whether this approach is applicable to other human cancers with defects in other DNA repair genes has yet to be determined. The ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is altered in several human cancers including mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). Here, we characterize a panel of MCL cell lines for ATM status and function and investigate the potential for synthetic lethality in MCL in the presence of small-molecule inhibitors of PARP-1. We show that Granta-519 and UPN2 cells have low levels of ATM protein, are defective in DNA damage-induced ATM-dependent signaling, are radiation sensitive, and have cell cycle checkpoint defects: all characteristics of defective ATM function. Significantly, Granta-519 and UPN2 cells were more sensitive to PARP-1 inhibition than were the ATM-proficient MCL cell lines examined. Furthermore, the PARP-1 inhibitor olaparib (known previously as AZD2281/KU-0059436) significantly decreased tumor growth and increased overall survival in mice bearing s.c. xenografts of ATM-deficient Granta-519 cells while producing only a modest effect on overall survival of mice bearing xenografts of the ATM-proficient cell line, Z138. Thus, PARP inhibitors have therapeutic potential in the treatment of MCL, and the concept of synthetic lethality extends to human cancers with ATM alterations.",cancer
1912,Lip Injection Techniques Using Small-Particle Hyaluronic Acid Dermal Filler.,"The shape and fullness of the lips have a significant role in facial aesthetics and outward appearance. The corrective needs of a patient can range from a subtle enhancement to a complete recontouring including correction of perioral rhytides. A comprehensive understanding of the lower face anatomical features and injection site techniques are foundational information for injectors. Likewise, the choice of filler material contributes to the success of the injection techniques used, and facilitates a safe, effective, and natural appearing outcome. The small-particle HA 20 mg/mL with lidocaine 0.3% (SP-HAL, Restylane® Silk; Galderma Laboratories, Fort Worth, Texas) is indicated for submucosal implantation for lip augmentation and dermal implantation for correction of perioral rhytides. Due to its rheological properties and smaller particle size, SP-HAL is a well-suited filler for the enhancement and correction of lip shape and volume, as well as for the correction of very fine perioral rhytides. This work is a combined overview of techniques found in the current literature and recommendations provided by contributing authors. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1076-1082.",nonCancer
1765,Complication Rates After Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Use in Orthopaedic Surgery in Children: A Concise Multicenter Retrospective Cohort Study.,"The use of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) has been associated with a number of complications in adult patients. However, this association is less established in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety of BMP use in children by determining the complication rates after BMP use at multiple institutions.|In a retrospective study (2000 to 2013), the medical records of all patients who received BMP at any of the 5 institutions were reviewed. Demographic information, preoperative data, and postoperative follow-up data were collected on those patients who were under the age of 18 at the time of surgery.|A total of 312 pediatric patients underwent surgery with BMP application during the study period. The surgical procedures consisted of 228 spinal fusions, 39 pars repairs, 33 nonunion repair, and 12 other various procedures. Overall 21% (65/312) of patients who had BMP utilized had a complication. Fifty-five percent (36/65) of patients with a complication required a revision surgery. The average follow-up was 27 months (range, 3 to 96 mo); 80% of patients had a follow-up period of >12 months. The average age at the time of surgery was 13 years (range, 1 to 17 y). Males and females were almost equally represented in the study: 143 males (46%) and 168 females (54%). Of the patients who received BMP, 9% had minor complications and 13% had major complications. Wound dehiscence without infection was the most common minor complication and occurred in 59% (16/27) of patients with minor complications. Infection and implant failures were the most frequent major complications, occurring in 38% (15/39) and 33% (13/39) of patients with major complications, respectively. Five of 312 (2%) patients had neurological injury, 3 of which were only temporary.|This multicenter study demonstrates a relatively high rate of complications after the use of BMP in children. However, further study is needed to attribute the complications directly to the use of BMP.|Level IV.",nonCancer
1501,Immediate referral to colposcopy vs. cytological surveillance for low-grade cervical cytological abnormalities in the absence of HPV test: A systematic review and a meta-analysis of the literature.,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the optimum management strategy for women with atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS/borderline) or low-grade squamous intra-epithelial lesions (LSIL/mild dyskaryosis) cytological abnormalities at primary screening in the absence of HPV DNA test. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CENTRAL and included randomised controlled trials comparing immediate colposcopy to cytological surveillance in women with ASCUS/LSIL. The outcomes of interest were occurrence of different histological grades of cervical intra-epithelial neoplasia (CIN) and default rates during follow-up. Pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using a random-effect model and with inverse variance weighting. Interstudy heterogeneity was assessed using I2 statistics. Six RCTs were included. Immediate colposcopy significantly increased detection of unimportant abnormalities as opposed to repeat cytology (koilocytosis:32% vs.21%, RR:1.49, 95%CI=1.17-1.90); CIN1:21% vs.8%, RR:2.58, 95%CI=1.69-3.94). Although immediate colposcopy detected CIN2, CIN2+ and CIN3+ earlier than cytology, the differences were no longer observed at 24 months (CIN3+:10.3 vs.11.9%, RR:1.02, 95%CI=0.53-1.97), with significant inters-study heterogeneity (p<0.001,I2=93%). Default risk was significantly higher for repeat cytology (6months: 6.3 vs.13.3%, RR:3.85, 95%CI=1.27-11.63; 12months: 6.3 vs.14.8%, RR:6.39, 95%CI=1.24-32.95; 24 months: 0.9 vs.16.1%, RR:19.1,95%CI=9.02-40.4). Detection of CIN2+ for cytological surveillance over two years is similar to that of immediate colposcopy, although patients may default. Colposcopy may be first choice when good compliance is not assured, but may increase detection of insignificant lesions. This emphasizes the need for a reflex triage test to distinguish women who need diagnostic work-up from those who can return to routine recall. This article is protected by copyright.

1301,Ablation of Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer with Percutaneous Irreversible Electroporation: Results of the Phase I/II PANFIRE Study.,"Purpose To (a) investigate the safety of percutaneous irreversible electroporation (IRE) for locally advanced pancreatic cancer and (b) evaluate the quality of life (QOL), pain perception, and efficacy in terms of time to local progression, event-free survival, and overall survival (OS). Materials and Methods The study was approved by the local review board (NL42888.029.13). All patients provided written informed consent for study participation, the ablation procedure, and data usage. Between January 2014 and June 2015, 25 patients with histologically proved locally advanced pancreatic cancer 5 cm or smaller (13 women, 12 men; median age, 61 years; age range, 41-78 years) were prospectively included to undergo percutaneous computed tomographic-guided IRE. Patients with a metallic biliary Wallstent, epilepsy, or ventricular arrhythmias were excluded. Kaplan-Meier estimates were used to investigate time to local progression, event-free survival, and OS. Safety was assessed on the basis of adverse events, which were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. Pain perception and QOL were evaluated by using specific questionnaires. Results All patients underwent IRE. The median largest tumor diameter was 4.0 cm (range, 3.3-5.0 cm). After a median follow-up of 12 months (interquartile range: 7-16 months), median event-free survival after IRE was 8 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4 months, 12 months); the median time to local progression after IRE was 12 months (95% CI: 8 months, 16 months). The median OS was 11 months from IRE (95% CI: 9 months, 13 months) and 17 months from diagnosis (95% CI: 10 months, 24 months). There were 12 minor complications (grade I or II) and 11 major complications (nine grade III, two grade IV) in 10 patients. There were no deaths within 90 days after IRE. Conclusion Percutaneous IRE for locally advanced pancreatic cancer is generally well tolerated, although major adverse events can occur. Preliminary survival data are encouraging and support the setup of larger phase II and III clinical trials to assess the efficacy of IRE plus chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant or second-line setting compared with more widely adopted regimens such as chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

917,A genomic case study of mixed fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Mixed fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (mFL-HCC) is a rare liver tumor defined by the presence of both pure FL-HCC and conventional HCC components, represents up to 25% of cases of FL-HCC, and has been associated with worse prognosis. Recent genomic characterization of pure FL-HCC identified a highly recurrent transcript fusion (DNAJB1:PRKACA) not found in conventional HCC. We performed exome and transcriptome sequencing of a case of mFL-HCC. A novel BAC-capture approach was developed to identify a 400 kb deletion as the underlying genomic mechanism for a DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion in this case. A sensitive Nanostring Elements assay was used to screen for this transcript fusion in a second case of mFL-HCC, 112 additional HCC samples and 44 adjacent non-tumor liver samples. We report the first comprehensive genomic analysis of a case of mFL-HCC. No common HCC-associated mutations were identified. The very low mutation rate of this case, large number of mostly single-copy, long-range copy number variants, and high expression of ERBB2 were more consistent with previous reports of pure FL-HCC than conventional HCC. In particular, the DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion transcript specifically associated with pure FL-HCC was detected at very high expression levels. Subsequent analysis revealed the presence of this fusion in all primary and metastatic samples, including those with mixed or conventional HCC pathology. A second case of mFL-HCC confirmed our finding that the fusion was detectable in conventional components. An expanded screen identified a third case of fusion-positive HCC, which upon review, also had both conventional and fibrolamellar features. This screen confirmed the absence of the fusion in all conventional HCC and adjacent non-tumor liver samples. These results indicate that mFL-HCC is similar to pure FL-HCC at the genomic level and the DNAJB1:PRKACA fusion can be used as a diagnostic tool for both pure and mFL-HCC.",cancer
271,Resistant mutations in CML and Ph(+)ALL - role of ponatinib.,"In 2012, ponatinib (Iclusig(®)), an orally available pan-BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) developed by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in resistant or intolerant chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph(+)ALL). Ponatinib is the only approved TKI capable of inhibiting BCR-ABL with the gatekeeper T315I kinase domain mutation, known to be the cause for 20% of resistant or relapsed CML cases. In 2013, ponatinib sales were temporarily suspended due to serious side effects seen in nearly 12% of the patient population. These side effects are thought to stem from the potent nature and pan-activity of this TKI. ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has since been permitted to resume sales and marketing of ponatinib to a limited patient population with an expanded black box warning. In the following review, the use of ponatinib in CML and Ph(+)ALL will be discussed. Mechanisms of resistance in CML are discussed, which provide insight and background into the need for this third generation TKI, followed by the molecular design and pharmacology of ponatinib, which lead to its success as a therapeutic. Finally, the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ponatinib will be highlighted, including summaries of the important clinical trials involving ponatinib as well as its current place in therapy.",cancer
621,Impaired aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 subfamily member 2A-dependent retinoic acid signaling is related with a mesenchymal-like phenotype and an unfavorable prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.,"An inverse correlation between expression of the aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 subfamily A2 (ALDH1A2) and gene promoter methylation has been identified as a common feature of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Moreover, low ALDH1A2 expression was associated with an unfavorable prognosis of OPSCC patients, however the causal link between reduced ALDH1A2 function and treatment failure has not been addressed so far. Serial sections from tissue microarrays of patients with primary OPSCC (n = 101) were stained by immunohistochemistry for key regulators of retinoic acid (RA) signaling, including ALDH1A2. Survival with respect to these regulators was investigated by univariate Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariate Cox regression proportional hazard models. The impact of ALDH1A2-RAR signaling on tumor-relevant processes was addressed in established tumor cell lines and in an orthotopic mouse xenograft model. Immunohistochemical analysis showed an improved prognosis of ALDH1A2(high) OPSCC only in the presence of CRABP2, an intracellular RA transporter. Moreover, an ALDH1A2(high)CRABP2(high) staining pattern served as an independent predictor for progression-free (HR: 0.395, p = 0.007) and overall survival (HR: 0.303, p = 0.002), suggesting a critical impact of RA metabolism and signaling on clinical outcome. Functionally, ALDH1A2 expression and activity in tumor cell lines were related to RA levels. While administration of retinoids inhibited clonogenic growth and proliferation, the pharmacological inhibition of ALDH1A2-RAR signaling resulted in loss of cell-cell adhesion and a mesenchymal-like phenotype. Xenograft tumors derived from FaDu cells with stable silencing of ALDH1A2 and primary tumors from OPSCC patients with low ALDH1A2 expression exhibited a mesenchymal-like phenotype characterized by vimentin expression. This study has unraveled a critical role of ALDH1A2-RAR signaling in the pathogenesis of head and neck cancer and our data implicate that patients with ALDH1A2(low) tumors might benefit from adjuvant treatment with retinoids.",cancer

Fifty-four studies met criteria. We explore these studies, providing a compilation of information (e.g., educational, simulation, and research methods used; outcome measures reported; and demographics of learner groups), identifying themes that may affect learning, as well as surfacing challenges and gaps in the field. The quality and rigor of the existing literature is inadequate to confidently determine factors that affect learning through simulation-enhanced IPE. We suggest that more rigorous research criteria be included in future studies and a list of reporting items be provided, where future publications can enhance knowledge to guide best practice in simulation-enhanced IPE.",nonCancer
2285,"Selection of a marker gene to construct a reference library for wetland plants, and the application of metabarcoding to analyze the diet of wintering herbivorous waterbirds.","Food availability and diet selection are important factors influencing the abundance and distribution of wild waterbirds. In order to better understand changes in waterbird population, it is essential to figure out what they feed on. However, analyzing their diet could be difficult and inefficient using traditional methods such as microhistologic observation. Here, we addressed this gap of knowledge by investigating the diet of greater white-fronted goose Anser albifrons and bean goose Anser fabalis, which are obligate herbivores wintering in China, mostly in the Middle and Lower Yangtze River floodplain. First, we selected a suitable and high-resolution marker gene for wetland plants that these geese would consume during the wintering period. Eight candidate genes were included: rbcL, rpoC1, rpoB, matK, trnH-psbA, trnL (UAA), atpF-atpH, and psbK-psbI. The selection was performed via analysis of representative sequences from NCBI and comparison of amplification efficiency and resolution power of plant samples collected from the wintering area. The trnL gene was chosen at last with c/h primers, and a local plant reference library was constructed with this gene. Then, utilizing DNA metabarcoding, we discovered 15 food items in total from the feces of these birds. Of the 15 unique dietary sequences, 10 could be identified at specie level. As for greater white-fronted goose, 73% of sequences belonged to Poaceae spp., and 26% belonged to Carex spp. In contrast, almost all sequences of bean goose belonged to Carex spp. (99%). Using the same samples, microhistology provided consistent food composition with metabarcoding results for greater white-fronted goose, while 13% of Poaceae was recovered for bean goose. In addition, two other taxa were discovered only through microhistologic analysis. Although most of the identified taxa matched relatively well between the two methods, DNA metabarcoding gave taxonomically more detailed information. Discrepancies were likely due to biased PCR amplification in metabarcoding, low discriminating power of current marker genes for monocots, and biases in microhistologic analysis. The diet differences between two geese species might indicate deeper ecological significance beyond the scope of this study. We concluded that DNA metabarcoding provides new perspectives for studies of herbivorous waterbird diets and inter-specific interactions, as well as new possibilities to investigate interactions between herbivores and plants. In addition, microhistologic analysis should be used together with metabarcoding methods to integrate this information.",nonCancer
228,Prognostic value of genetic alterations in children with first bone marrow relapse of childhood B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia.,"Despite risk-adapted treatment, survival of children with relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) remains poor compared with that of patients with initial diagnosis of ALL. Leukemia-associated genetic alterations may provide novel prognostic factors to refine present relapse treatment strategies. Therefore, we investigated the clinical relevance of 13 recurrent genetic alterations in 204 children treated uniformly for relapsed B-cell precursor ALL according to the ALL-REZ BFM 2002 protocol. The most common alterations were deletions of CDKN2A/2B, IKZF1, PAX5, ETV6, fusion of ETV6-RUNX1 and deletions and/or mutations of TP53. Multivariate analysis identified IKZF1 deletion and TP53 alteration as independent predictors of inferior outcome (P=0.002 and P=0.001). Next, we investigated how both alterations can improve the established risk stratification in relapsed ALL. Intermediate-risk relapse patients with low minimal residual disease are currently considered to have a good prognosis. In this group, deletion of IKZF1 and alteration of TP53 identify patients with significantly inferior outcome (P<0.001). In high-risk relapse patients, deletion of IKZF1 is strongly predictive of a second relapse after stem cell transplantation (P<0.001). We conclude that IKZF1 and TP53 represent relevant prognostic factors that should be considered in future risk assessment of children with relapsed ALL to indicate treatment intensification or intervention.",cancer
402,"Clinical Translation and Validation of a Predictive Biomarker for Patritumab, an Anti-human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 3 (HER3) Monoclonal Antibody, in Patients With Advanced Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.","During early clinical development, prospective identification of a predictive biomarker and validation of an assay method may not always be feasible. Dichotomizing a continuous biomarker measure to classify responders also leads to challenges. We present a case study of a prospective-retrospective approach for a continuous biomarker identified after patient enrollment but defined prospectively before the unblinding of data. An analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach and the challenges encountered in its practical application are also provided. HERALD (NCT02134015) was a double-blind, phase 2 study in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) randomized to erlotinib with placebo or with high or low doses of patritumab, a monoclonal antibody targeted against human epidermal growth factor receptor 3 (HER3). While the primary objective was to assess safety and progression-free survival (PFS), a secondary objective was to determine a single predictive biomarker hypothesis to identify subjects most likely to benefit from the addition of patritumab. Although not identified as the primary biomarker in the study protocol, on the basis of preclinical results from 2 independent laboratories, expression levels of the HER3 ligand heregulin (HRG) were prospectively declared the predictive biomarker before data unblinding but after subject enrollment. An assay to measure HRG mRNA was developed and validated. Other biomarkers, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation status, were also evaluated in an exploratory fashion. The cutoff value for high vs. low HRG mRNA levels was set at the median delta threshold cycle. A maximum likelihood analysis was performed to evaluate the provisional cutoff. The relationship of HRG values to PFS hazard ratios (HRs) was assessed as a measure of internal validation. Additional NSCLC samples were analyzed to characterize HRG mRNA distribution. The subgroup of patients with high HRG mRNA levels (""HRG-high"") demonstrated clinical benefit from patritumab treatment with HRs of 0.37 (P = 0.0283) and 0.29 (P = 0.0027) in the high- and low-dose patritumab arms, respectively. However, only 102 of the 215 randomized patients (47.4%) had sufficient tumor samples for HRG mRNA measurement. Maximum likelihood analysis showed that the provisional cutoff was within the optimal range. In the placebo arm, the HRG-high subgroup demonstrated worse prognosis compared with HRG-low. A continuous relationship was observed between increased HRG mRNA levels and lower HR. Additional NSCLC samples (N = 300) demonstrated a similar unimodal distribution to that observed in this study, suggesting that the defined cutoff may be applicable to future NSCLC studies. The prospective-retrospective approach was successful in clinically validating a probable predictive biomarker. Post hoc in vitro studies and statistical analyses permitted further testing of the underlying assumptions. However, limitations of this analysis include the incomplete collection of adequate tumor tissue and a lack of stratification. In a phase 3 study, findings are being confirmed, and the HRG cutoff value is being further refined. NCT02134015.",cancer
346,MET gene exon 14 deletion created using the CRISPR/Cas9 system enhances cellular growth and sensitivity to a MET inhibitor.,"MET splice site mutations resulting in an exon 14 deletion have been reported to be present in about 3% of all lung adenocarcinomas. Patients with lung adenocarcinoma and a MET splice site mutation who have responded to MET inhibitors have been reported. The CRISPR/Cas9 system is a recently developed genome-engineering tool that can easily and rapidly cause small insertions or deletions. We created an in vitro model for MET exon 14 deletion using the CRISPR/Cas9 system and the HEK293 cell line. The phenotype, which included MET inhibitor sensitivity, was then investigated in vitro. Additionally, MET splice site mutations were analyzed in several cancers included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. An HEK293 cell line with a MET exon 14 deletion was easily and rapidly created; this cell line had a higher MET protein expression level, enhanced MET phosphorylation, and prolonged MET activation. In addition, a direct comparison of phenotypes using this system demonstrated enhanced cellular growth, colony formation, and MET inhibitor sensitivity. In the TCGA dataset, lung adenocarcinomas had the highest incidence of MET exon 14 deletions, while other cancers rarely carried such mutations. Approximately 10% of the lung adenocarcinoma samples without any of driver gene alterations carried the MET exon 14 deletion. These findings suggested that this system may be useful for experiments requiring the creation of specific mutations, and the present experimental findings encourage the development of MET-targeted therapy against lung cancer carrying the MET exon 14 deletion.",cancer
2482,Flavonoids from Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb. and their cytotoxic activities against human cancer cell lines.,"Flavonoids have been demonstrated to have cytotoxic activities toward numerous human cancer cells, whereas they have little or no effect on normal cells. The numerous flavonoids in traditional Chinese herbs may be promising candidates for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. Our previous study demonstrated that CH2Cl2 and 95% ethanol eluate (EE) fractions have the strongest cytotoxic activities against human cancer cell lines of the 9 fractions separated from Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb., which is widely used to prevent and treat diverse diseases in Northeast China. In the present study, 8 flavonoids were isolated from the 95% EE fraction of Artemisia sacrorum Ledeb. The chemical structures of the compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analyses. The following 5 flavonoids were isolated for the first time from this plant: Jaceosidin, kaempferol, quercetin, luteolin and quercitrin. A total of 2 flavonoids from the CH2Cl2 fraction and 8 flavonoids from the 95% EE fraction were examined to evaluate their cytotoxic activities against human SK-HEP-1 hepatoma cancer cells and human HeLa cervical cancer cells, respectively. The results revealed that 2 flavonoids had marked cytotoxic activities against HeLa cells.",nonCancer
1709,"Association between IL-33 Gene Polymorphisms (rs1929992, rs7044343) and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in a Chinese Han Population.","Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is a member of the IL-1 family, and previous studies found the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the IL-33 gene was related to susceptibility to autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and Behcet's disease. To date, no study has discussed the potential association between IL-33 gene polymorphisms and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).|We conducted a case-control study including 371 SLE patients and 408 healthy controls to investigate the correlation between the SNPs of IL-33 gene (rs1929992, rs7044343) and SLE in a Chinese Han population.|There was significantly lower expression of allele G for rs1929992 in SLE patients than that in controls (G versus A, P = 0.012, OR = 1.310, 95% CI: 1.060-1.624 after adjustment with sex). Similarly, genotype GG was associated with the susceptibility to SLE as compared with the AA genotype (P = 0.017, OR = 1.714, 95% CI: 1.101-2.669 after adjustment with sex). We also found statistical significance in the dominant model (GG+GA versus AA, P = 0.017, OR = 1.481, 95% CI: 1.074-2.044 after adjustment with sex). However, we found no strong evidence for the association of IL-33 rs7044343 polymorphism with SLE. Moreover, association studies were performed on the relationship between the IL-33 gene polymorphisms and lupus nephritis as well as nine clinical features of SLE, but there was no significant association regarding the distribution of allele and genotype frequencies between SLE patients positive and negative for the presence of sub-phenotypes.|Our findings indicate that IL-33 rs1929992 polymorphism may be a potential biomarker for susceptibility to SLE.",nonCancer

Demographics, condition severity, school adjustment, and family function were the contextual self-management factors, whereas self-management knowledge, self-efficacy, and social support were the process factors.|Age and condition severity were the contextual factors influencing self-management behaviors in children with SB; among the process factors, self-management knowledge and self-efficacy were statistically significant predictors.|To improve self-management behaviors in children with SB, it is necessary to develop intervention programs that reflect their age and condition severity as contextual factors and aim to enhance self-management knowledge and self-efficacy as process factors.",nonCancer
2533,Gibberellin-Abscisic Acid Balances during Arbuscular Mycorrhiza Formation in Tomato.,"Plant hormones have become appropriate candidates for driving functional plant mycorrhization programs, including the processes that regulate the formation of arbuscules in arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis. Here, we examine the role played by ABA/GA interactions regulating the formation of AM in tomato. We report differences in ABA and GA metabolism between control and mycorrhizal roots. Active synthesis and catabolism of ABA occur in AM roots. GAs level increases as a consequence of a symbiosis-induced mechanism that requires functional arbuscules which in turn is dependent on a functional ABA pathway. A negative interaction in their metabolism has been demonstrated. ABA attenuates GA-biosynthetic and increases GA-catabolic gene expression leading to a reduction in bioactive GAs. Vice versa, GA activated ABA catabolism mainly in mycorrhizal roots. The negative impact of GA3 on arbuscule abundance in wild-type plants is partially offset by treatment with ABA and the application of a GA biosynthesis inhibitor rescued the arbuscule abundance in the ABA-deficient sitiens mutant. These findings, coupled with the evidence that ABA application leads to reduce bioactive GA1, support the hypothesis that ABA could act modifying bioactive GA level to regulate AM. Taken together, our results suggest that these hormones perform essential functions and antagonize each other by oppositely regulating AM formation in tomato roots.",nonCancer
2467,Localized (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake at the pancreatic head during remission phase of autoimmune pancreatitis: A case report.,"Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is a unique form of pancreatitis, histopathologically characterized by dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis of the pancreas with obliterative phlebitis. AIP is associated with a good response to steroid therapy. Differentiation between AIP and pancreatic cancer to determine a preoperative diagnosis is often challenging, despite the use of various diagnostic modalities, including computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. It has been reported that (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT may be a useful tool for distinguishing between the two diseases. In the present case report, a 71-year-old male patient presented with a well-circumscribed, solitary, nodular and homogenous (18)F-FDG uptake at the pancreatic head, while receiving maintenance steroid therapy in the remission phase of AIP; preoperatively, the patient had been strongly suspected of having pancreatic cancer. Pathological examination revealed post-treatment relapse of AIP. The present case highlights the diagnostic and management difficulties with AIP in the remission phase.

2323,Vegemite Beer: yeast extract spreads as nutrient supplements to promote fermentation.,"Vegemite is an iconic Australian food spread made from spent brewers' yeast extract, which has been reported to be used as an ingredient in illegal home brewing. In this study, we tested the utility of Vegemite and the similar spread Marmite in promoting fermentation. We could not culture microorganisms from either Vegemite or Marmite, consistent with these food-grade spreads being essentially sterile. To test if the addition of Vegemite or Marmite could assist in fermentation when additional viable yeast was also present, solutions containing glucose and a range of concentrations of either Vegemite or Marmite were inoculated with brewers' yeast. No fermentation occurred in any condition without addition of extra brewer's yeast. Fermentation did not occur when yeast was inoculated into solutions containing only glucose, but progressed efficiently with when Vegemite or Marmite was also added. Gas Chromatography confirmed that ethanol was present at ∼3% v/v post-fermentation in all samples which contained glucose, Vegemite or Marmite, and brewers' yeast. Trace amounts of methanol were also detected. Mass spectrometry proteomics identified abundant intracellular yeast proteins and barley proteins in Vegemite and Marmite, and abundant secreted yeast proteins from actively growing yeast in those samples to which extra brewers' yeast had been added. We estimate that the real-world cost of home brewed ""Vegemite Beer"" would be very low. Our results show that Vegemite or other yeast extract spreads could provide cheap and readily available sources of nutrient supplementation to increase the efficiency of fermentation in home brewing or other settings.",nonCancer
835,Clinical and molecular response to interferon-α therapy in essential thrombocythemia patients with CALR mutations.,"Myeloproliferative neoplasms are clonal disorders characterized by the presence of several gene mutations associated with particular hematologic parameters, clinical evolution, and prognosis. Few therapeutic options are available, among which interferon α (IFNα) presents interesting properties like the ability to induce hematologic responses (HRs) and molecular responses (MRs) in patients with JAK2 mutation. We report on the response to IFNα therapy in a cohort of 31 essential thrombocythemia (ET) patients with CALR mutations (mean follow-up of 11.8 years). HR was achieved in all patients. Median CALR mutant allelic burden (%CALR) significantly decreased from 41% at baseline to 26% after treatment, and 2 patients even achieved complete MR. In contrast, %CALR was not significantly modified in ET patients treated with hydroxyurea or aspirin only. Next-generation sequencing identified additional mutations in 6 patients (affecting TET2, ASXL1, IDH2, and TP53 genes). The presence of additional mutations was associated with poorer MR on CALR mutant clones, with only minor or no MRs in this subset of patients. Analysis of the evolution of the different variant allele frequencies showed that the mutated clones had a differential sensitivity to IFNα in a given patient, but no new mutation emerged during treatment. In all, this study shows that IFNα induces high rates of HRs and MRs in CALR-mutated ET, and that the presence of additional nondriver mutations may influence the MR to therapy.",cancer

We analyzed the mutational status and overall survival of 215 patients receiving treatment with dacarbazine or temozolomide. All patients who started first-line treatment at our institution between 2000 and 2010 were included to prevent selection and bias due to thereafter arising therapeutic options. No patient received BRAF- or MEK-inhibitors during follow-up. Survival was associated with the pattern of visceral involvement, the presence of brain metastases and the serum lactate dehydrogenase level (all p<0.001). The BRAF-V600 mutational status was not associated with survival and no differences in overall survival were detected according to age, gender or to the cytotoxic agent used for therapy. In Cox regression analysis the presence of brain metastases (hazard ratio 2.3; p<0.001) and an elevated serum LDH (hazard ratio 2.5; p<0.001) were the only factors, which independently predicted survival. No differences in prognosis were observed according to the BRAF mutational status in patients with distant metastasis treated with monochemotherapy.",cancer

2,Do AML patients with DNMT3A exon 23 mutations benefit from idarubicin as compared to daunorubicin? A single center experience.,"Mutations in DNMT3A encoding DNA methyltransferase 3A were recently described in patients with acute myeloid leukemia. To assess their prognostic significance, we determined the mutational status of DNMT3A exon 23 in 288 patients with AML excluding acute promyelocytic leukemia, aged from 18 to 65 years and treated in Toulouse University Hospital. A mutation was detected in 39 patients (13.5%). All DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had intermediate-risk cytogenetics. Mutations significantly correlated with a higher WBC count (p less than 0.001), NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations (p=0.027). DNMT3A mutations were conserved through xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice. No difference in outcome between DNMT3A exon 23+ and DNMT3A exon 23- patients was found even if the results were stratified by NPM1 or FLT3-ITD status. However, DNMT3A exon 23+ patients had better median DFS (not reached vs 11.6 months, p=0.009) and OS (not reached vs 14.3 months, p=0.005) as compared to DNMT3A exon 23- patients when treated with idarubicin, whereas patients treated with daunorubicin had similar outcome regardless the DNMT3A status. This study shows that DNMT3A mutations have no impact on outcome but could be a predictive factor for response to idarubicin and thus, could have a direct influence in the way AML patients should be managed.",cancer
526,Correlation of basic fibroblast growth factor expression with the invasion and the prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the expression of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR-1) in cancer cells and fibroblasts at the invasive front of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), and the pathologic and clinical characteristics. Sections of 61 biopsy specimens of primary OSCC were immunostained to assess the expression of bFGF and FGFR-1 in cancer cells and fibroblasts at the invasive front. The bFGF and FGFR-1 expressions in the cancer cells were evident in all specimens, whilst, in fibroblasts, they were detected in 41 (67%) of 61 specimens. These expressions in the fibroblasts occurred notably more often in high-invasive OSCC specimens than low-invasive OSCC specimens. The prevalence of bFGF and FGFR-1 expressions in cases with lymph node metastasis was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than in cases without metastasis. Moreover, these expressions were well correlated with patient prognosis. This study concludes that bFGF and FGFR-1 expressions in fibroblasts at the invasive front are linked to the mode of invasion and the prognosis in OSCC.",cancer
901,mTOR and HIF-1alpha-mediated tumor metabolism in an LKB1 mouse model of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.,"Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a familial cancer disorder due to inherited loss of function mutations in the LKB1/ STK11 serine/threonine kinase. PJS patients develop gastrointestinal hamartomas with 100% penetrance often in the second decade of life, and demonstrate an increased predisposition toward the development of a number of additional malignancies. Among mitogenic signaling pathways, the mammalian-target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway is hyperactivated in tissues and tumors derived from LKB1-deficient mice. Consistent with a central role for mTORC1 in these tumors, rapamycin as a single agent results in a dramatic suppression of preexisting GI polyps in LKB1+/- mice. However, the key targets of mTORC1 in LKB1-deficient tumors remain unknown. We demonstrate here that these polyps, and LKB1- and AMPK-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts, show dramatic up-regulation of the HIF-1alpha transcription factor and its downstream transcriptional targets in an rapamycin-suppressible manner. The HIF-1alpha targets hexokinase II and Glut1 are up-regulated in these polyps, and using FDG-PET, we demonstrate that LKB1+/- mice show increased glucose utilization in focal regions of their GI tract corresponding to these gastrointestinal hamartomas. Importantly, we demonstrate that polyps from human Peutz-Jeghers patients similarly exhibit up-regulated mTORC1 signaling, HIF-1alpha, and GLUT1 levels. Furthermore, like HIF-1alpha and its target genes, the FDG-PET signal in the GI tract of these mice is abolished by rapamycin treatment. These findings suggest a number of therapeutic modalities for the treatment and detection of hamartomas in PJS patients, and potential for the screening and treatment of the 30% of sporadic human lung cancers bearing LKB1 mutations.",cancer

2391,Surviving a Suicide Attempt.,"Suicide is a global phenomenon in all regions of the world affecting people of all age groups. It has detrimental consequences on patients, their families, and the community as a whole. There have been numerous risk factors described for suicide including mental illness, stressful life situations, loss of social support, and general despair. The association of suicide with Islam has not been extensively studied. The common impression from clinical practice is that being a practicing Muslim reduces the risk of suicide. Another factor associated with suicide is starting a patient on antidepressants. However, this has been questioned recently. This report describes a middle-aged man with depression and multiple social stressors who survived a serious suicide attempt. The discussion will focus on the factors that lead him to want to end his life and the impact of the assumed protective factors such as religious belief and family support on this act of self-harm. Such patients can be on the edge when there is an imbalance between risk factors (such as depression, insomnia, and psychosocial stressors) and protective factors (like religious affiliation and family support). All physicians are advised to assess the suicide risk thoroughly in patients with depression regardless of any presumed protective factor.",nonCancer
611,Cabozantinib overcomes crizotinib resistance in ROS1 fusion-positive cancer.,"ROS1 rearrangement leads to constitutive ROS1 activation with potent transforming activity. In an ongoing phase I trial, the ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) crizotinib shows remarkable initial responses in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring ROS1 fusions; however, cancers eventually develop crizotinib resistance due to acquired mutations such as G2032R in ROS1. Thus, understanding the crizotinib-resistance mechanisms in ROS1-rearranged NSCLC and identification of therapeutic strategies to overcome the resistance are required. The sensitivity of CD74-ROS1-transformed Ba/F3 cells to multiple ALK inhibitors was examined. Acquired ROS1 inhibitor-resistant mutations in CD74-ROS1 fusion were screened by N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea mutagenesis with Ba/F3 cells. To overcome the resistance mutation, we performed high-throughput drug screening with small-molecular inhibitors and anticancer drugs used in clinical practice or being currently tested in clinical trials. The effect of the identified drug was assessed in the CD74-ROS1-mutant Ba/F3 cells and crizotinib-resistant patient-derived cancer cells (MGH047) harboring G2032R-mutated CD74-ROS1. We identified multiple novel crizotinib-resistance mutations in the ROS1 kinase domain, including the G2032R mutation. As the result of high-throughput drug screening, we found that the cMET/RET/VEGFR inhibitor cabozantinib (XL184) effectively inhibited the survival of CD74-ROS1 wild-type (WT) and resistant mutants harboring Ba/F3 and MGH047 cells. Furthermore, cabozantinib could overcome all the resistance by all newly identified secondary mutations. We developed a comprehensive model of acquired resistance to ROS1 inhibitors in NSCLC with ROS1 rearrangement and identified cabozantinib as a therapeutic strategy to overcome the resistance.",cancer

We explored the effects of KIT inhibition using imatinib mesylate in this molecular subset of disease. To assess clinical effects of imatinib mesylate in patients with melanoma harboring KIT alterations. A single-group, open-label, phase 2 trial at 1 community and 5 academic oncology centers in the United States of 295 patients with melanoma screened for the presence of KIT mutations and amplification between April 23, 2007, and April 16, 2010. A total of 51 cases with such alterations were identified and 28 of these patients were treated who had advanced unresectable melanoma arising from acral, mucosal, and chronically sun-damaged sites. Imatinib mesylate, 400 mg orally twice daily. Radiographic response, with secondary end points including time to progression, overall survival, and correlation of molecular alterations and clinical response. Two complete responses lasting 94 (ongoing) and 95 weeks, 2 durable partial responses lasting 53 and 89 (ongoing) weeks, and 2 transient partial responses lasting 12 and 18 weeks among the 25 evaluable patients were observed. The overall durable response rate was 16% (95% confidence interval [CI], 2%-30%), with a median time to progression of 12 weeks (interquartile range [IQR], 6-18 weeks; 95% CI, 11-18 weeks), and a median overall survival of 46.3 weeks (IQR, 28 weeks-not achieved; 95% CI, 28 weeks-not achieved). Response rate was better in cases with mutations affecting recurrent hotspots or with a mutant to wild-type allelic ratio of more than 1 (40% vs 0%, P = .05), indicating positive selection for the mutated allele. Among patients with advanced melanoma harboring KIT alterations, treatment with imatinib mesylate results in significant clinical responses in a subset of patients. Responses may be limited to tumors harboring KIT alterations of proven functional relevance. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00470470.",cancer
929,Growth Arrest-Specific 6 (GAS6) Promotes Prostate Cancer Survival by G1 Arrest/S Phase Delay and Inhibition of Apoptosis During Chemotherapy in Bone Marrow.,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is known to develop resistance to chemotherapy. Growth arrest-specific 6 (GAS6), plays a role in tumor progression by regulating growth in many cancers. Here, we explored how GAS6 regulates the cell cycle and apoptosis of PCa cells in response to chemotherapy. We found that GAS6 is sufficient to significantly increase the fraction of cells in G1 and the duration of phase in PCa cells. Importantly, the effect of GAS6 on G1 is potentiated during docetaxel chemotherapy. GAS6 altered the levels of several key cell cycle regulators, including the downregulation of Cyclin B1 (G2 /M phase), CDC25A, Cyclin E1, and CDK2 (S phase entry), while the upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors p27 and p21, Cyclin D1, and CDK4. Importantly, these changes became further accentuated during docetaxel treatment in the presence of GAS6. Moreover, GAS6 alters the apoptotic response of PCa cells during docetaxel chemotherapy. Docetaxel induced PCa cell apoptosis is efficiently suppressed in PCa cell culture in the presence of GAS6 or GAS6 secreted from co-cultured osteoblasts. Similarly, the GAS6-expressing bone environment protects PCa cells from apoptosis within primary tumors in vivo studies. Docetaxel induced significant levels of Caspase-3 and PARP cleavage in PCa cells, while GAS6 protected PCa cells from docetaxel-induced apoptotic signaling. Together, these data suggest that GAS6, expressed by osteoblasts in the bone marrow, plays a significant role in the regulation of PCa cell survival during chemotherapy, which will have important implications for targeting metastatic disease.

2316,"Temporal overlaps of feral cats with prey and competitors in primary and human-altered habitats on Bohol Island, Philippines.","The vertebrate fauna of the Philippines, known for its diversity and high proportion of endemic species, comprises mainly small- to medium-sized forms with a few large exceptions. As with other tropical ecosystems, the major threats to wildlife are habitat loss, hunting and invasive species, of which the feral cat (Felis catus) is considered the most damaging. Our camera-trapping study focused on a terrestrial vertebrate species inventory on Bohol Island and tempo-spatial co-occurrences of feral cats with their prey and competitors. The survey took place in the Rajah Sikatuna Protected Landscape, and we examined the primary rainforest, its border with agricultural land, and rural areas in the vicinity of villages. Altogether, over 2,885 trap days we captured 30 species of vertebrates-10 mammals (including Sus philippensis), 19 birds and one reptile, Varanus cumingi. We trapped 81.8% of expected vertebrates. Based on the number of events, the most frequent native species was the barred rail (Gallirallus torquatus). The highest overlap in diel activity between cats and potential prey was recorded with rodents in rural areas (Δ = 0.62); the lowest was in the same habitat with ground-dwelling birds (Δ = 0.40). Cat activity was not recorded inside the rainforest; in other habitats their diel activity pattern differed. The cats' activity declined in daylight in the proximity of humans, while it peaked at the transition zone between rainforest and fields. Both rodents and ground-dwelling birds exhibited a shift in activity levels between sites where cats were present or absent. Rodents tend to become active by day in cat-free habitats. No cats' temporal response to co-occurrences of civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus and Viverra tangalunga) was found but cats in diel activity avoided domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). Our first insight into the ecology of this invasive predator in the Philippines revealed an avoidance of homogeneous primary rainforest and a tendency to forage close to human settlements in heterogeneous habitats. A detailed further investigation of the composition of the cat's diet, as well as ranging pattern, is still needed.",nonCancer
2410,Aloe-emodin suppresses esophageal cancer cell TE1 proliferation by inhibiting AKT and ERK phosphorylation.,"Aberrant AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation is often observed in various human cancers. Both AKT and ERK are important in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/ERK signaling pathways, which play vital roles in cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Compounds that are able to block these pathways have therefore a promising use in cancer treatment and prevention. The present study revealed that AKT and ERK are activated in esophageal cancer TE1 cells. Aloe-emodin, an anthraquinone present in aloe latex, can suppress TE1 cell proliferation and anchor-independent cell growth. Aloe-emodin can also reduce the number of TE1 cells in S phase. Protein analysis indicated that aloe-emodin inhibits the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in a dose-dependent manner. Overall, the present data indicate that aloe-emodin can suppress TE1 cell growth by inhibiting AKT and ERK phosphorylation, and suggest its clinical use for cancer therapy.",nonCancer
1884,Factors related to the use of antenatal care services in Ethiopia: Application of the zero-inflated negative binomial model.,"The major causes for poor health in developing countries are inadequate access and under-use of modern health care services. The objective of this study was to identify and examine factors related to the use of antenatal care services using the 2011 Ethiopia Demographic and Health Survey data. The number of antenatal care visits during the last pregnancy by mothers aged 15 to 49 years (n = 7,737) was analyzed. More than 55% of the mothers did not use antenatal care (ANC) services, while more than 22% of the women used antenatal care services less than four times. More than half of the women (52%) who had access to health services had at least four antenatal care visits. The zero-inflated negative binomial model was found to be more appropriate for analyzing the data. Place of residence, age of mothers, woman's educational level, employment status, mass media exposure, religion, and access to health services were significantly associated with the use of antenatal care services.

85,Impact of FLT3(ITD) mutant allele level on relapse risk in intermediate-risk acute myeloid leukemia.,"Some studies have suggested that cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with low levels of FLT3 internal tandem duplications (FLT3(ITD)) do not have a worse prognosis if there is a concomitant NPM1 mutation, although this is controversial. To clarify this therapeutically important issue, we have analyzed FLT3(ITD) and NPM1(MUT) levels in 1609 younger adult cases of cytogenetically intermediate-risk AML. The cumulative incidence of relapse was increased in NPM1(MUT) cases by the presence of a FLT3(ITD), but did not differ markedly according to FLT3(ITD) level. This remained true when allowance was made for poor leukemic cell purity by adjustment of the FLT3(ITD) level to the measured NPM1(MUT) level. If consolidation therapies are to be determined by relapse risk, then NPM1(MUT) cases with low-level FLT3(ITD) should not be considered as good risk without further studies.

They are usually considered as favorable structures for catalysis due to their high activity and robust stability. However, formation of intermetallic compounds is often regarded as element specific. For instance, Ag and Pt do not form alloy in bulk phase through the conventional metallurgy approach in almost the entire range of composition. Herein, we demonstrate a bottom-up approach to create a new Ag-Pt compositional intermetallic phase from nanoparticles. By thermally treating the corresponding alloy nanoparticles in inert atmosphere, we obtained a bimetallic material which has an exceptional narrow Ag/Pt ratio around 52/48 to 53/47, and a structure of interchangeable closely packed Ag and Pt layers with 85 % on tetrahedral and 15% on octahedral sites. This rather unique stacking results in wavy patterns of Ag and Pt planes revealed by scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). This Ag-Pt compositional intermetallic phase is highly active for electrochemical oxidation of formic acid at low anodic potentials, 5 times higher than its alloy nanoparticles, and 29 times higher than the reference Pt/C at 0.4 V (vs RHE) in current density.",nonCancer

1275,Specific eye-head coordination enhances vision in progressive lens wearers.,"In uncorrected vision all combinations of eye and head positions are visually equivalent; thus, there is no need for a specific modification of eye-head coordination in young healthy observers. In contrast, the quality of visual input indeed strongly depends on eye position in the majority of healthy elderly drivers, namely in progressive additional lens (PALs) wearers. For a given distance, only specific combinations of eye and head position provide clear vision in a progressive lens wearer. However, although head movements are an integral part of gaze behavior, it is not known if eye-head coordination takes part in the enhancement of visual input in healthy individuals. In the current study we determined changes in eye-head coordination in progressive lens wearers in challenging tasks with high cognitive load, in the situation of driving. During a real-world drive on an urban round track in Stuttgart, gaze movements and head movements were measured in 17 PAL wearers and eye-head coordination was compared to 27 controls with unrestricted vision. Head movement behavior, specific to progressive lens wearers, was determined in head gain and temporal properties of head movements. Furthermore, vertical eye-head coordination was consistent only among PAL wearers. The observed differences in eye-head coordination clearly demonstrate a contribution of head movements in the enhancement of visual input in the healthy human visual system.",nonCancer
2104,Distinct stages in stress granule assembly and disassembly.,"Stress granules are non-membrane bound RNA-protein (RNP) assemblies that form when translation initiation is limited and contain a biphasic structure with stable core structures surrounded by a less concentrated shell. The order of assembly and disassembly of these two structures remains unknown. Time course analysis of granule assembly suggests that core formation is an early event in granule assembly. Stress granule disassembly is also a stepwise process with shell dissipation followed by core clearance. Perturbations that alter liquid-liquid phase separations (LLPS) driven by intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDR) of RNA binding proteins in vitro have the opposite effect on stress granule assembly in vivo. Taken together, these observations argue that stress granules assemble through a multistep process initiated by stable assembly of untranslated mRNPs into core structures, which could provide sufficient high local concentrations to allow for a localized LLPS driven by IDRs on RNA binding proteins.",nonCancer
2508,Curettage after uterine artery embolization combined with methotrexate treatment for caesarean scar pregnancy.,"In the present study, we evaluated the diagnosis and management modalities of caesarean scar pregnancy (CSP). Thirty patients diagnosed with CSP were retrospectively studied between February, 2010 and February, 2012. Twenty-five patients were offered prophylactic uterine artery embolization (UAE) and methotrexate (MTX) prior to uterine suction curettage. Five cases were referred from other hospitals where the initial management with uterine suction curettage had resulted in uncontrollable massive haemorrhage, 4 of the cases had UAE and one proceeded immediately to hysterectomy. In the 25 patients treated with prophylactic UAE and MTX, 12 had laparoscopy-guided curettage and 13 had ultrasound-guided curettage without complication. The results showed that the 25 patients with CSP, who received prophylactic UAE and MTX prior to uterine curettage, recovered without complications. Five patients referred from other hospitals, where uterine curettage was the primary procedure, had severe complications including uncontrolled vaginal bleeding and uterine rupture. Four of the five patients were treated successfully with emergency UAE and the remaining patient underwent emergency hysterectomy as ultrasound examination detected significant haemorrhage between the uterus and the bladder. Of the 25 patients who received prophylactic UAE combined with MTX, there were no reports of irregular menstruation or serious adverse effects. Notably, the decrease in serum human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) levels 3 days post-surgery was greater with ultrasound-guided curettage (84.3±5.5%) than with laparoscopy-guided curettage (76.3±10.2%). In summary, the data suggested that prophylactic UAE with MTX followed by ultrasound-guided curettage is the most effective therapeutic approach in CSP.",nonCancer
565,"Lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone in the second-line treatment of HER2-amplified advanced gastric cancer in Asian populations: TyTAN--a randomized, phase III study.","In Asian countries, paclitaxel once per week is used as second-line treatment in advanced gastric cancer, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) -positive tumors. The role of anti-HER2 agents, including lapatinib, in this setting and population is unclear. TyTAN was a two-part, parallel-group, phase III study in Asian patients. An open-label, dose-optimization phase (n = 12) was followed by a randomized phase (n = 261), in which patients who were HER2 positive by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) received lapatinib 1,500 mg once per day plus once-per-week paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) or paclitaxel alone. The primary end point was overall survival (OS). Secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS), time to progression (TTP), overall response rate (ORR), time to response, response duration, and safety. Analyses were based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gastrectomy status, prior trastuzumab therapy, and regional subpopulations. Median OS was 11.0 months with lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus 8.9 months with paclitaxel alone (P = .1044), with no significant difference in median PFS (5.4 v 4.4 months) or TTP (5.5 v 4.4 months). ORR was higher with lapatinib plus paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone (odds ratio, 3.85; P < .001). Better efficacy with lapatinib plus paclitaxel was demonstrated in IHC3+ compared with IHC0/1+ and 2+ patients and in Chinese compared with Japanese patients. A similar proportion of patients experienced adverse events with each treatment (lapatinib plus paclitaxel, 100% v paclitaxel alone, 98%). Lapatinib plus paclitaxel demonstrated activity in the second-line treatment of patients with HER2 FISH-positive IHC3+ advanced gastric cancer but did not significantly improve OS in the intent-to-treat population.",cancer
1172,Gefitinib or chemotherapy for non-small-cell lung cancer with mutated EGFR.,"Non-small-cell lung cancer with sensitive mutations of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is highly responsive to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as gefitinib, but little is known about how its efficacy and safety profile compares with that of standard chemotherapy. We randomly assigned 230 patients with metastatic, non-small-cell lung cancer and EGFR mutations who had not previously received chemotherapy to receive gefitinib or carboplatin-paclitaxel. The primary end point was progression-free survival; secondary end points included overall survival, response rate, and toxic effects. In the planned interim analysis of data for the first 200 patients, progression-free survival was significantly longer in the gefitinib group than in the standard-chemotherapy group (hazard ratio for death or disease progression with gefitinib, 0.36; P<0.001), resulting in early termination of the study. The gefitinib group had a significantly longer median progression-free survival (10.8 months, vs. 5.4 months in the chemotherapy group; hazard ratio, 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.22 to 0.41; P<0.001), as well as a higher response rate (73.7% vs. 30.7%, P<0.001). The median overall survival was 30.5 months in the gefitinib group and 23.6 months in the chemotherapy group (P=0.31). The most common adverse events in the gefitinib group were rash (71.1%) and elevated aminotransferase levels (55.3%), and in the chemotherapy group, neutropenia (77.0%), anemia (64.6%), appetite loss (56.6%), and sensory neuropathy (54.9%). One patient receiving gefitinib died from interstitial lung disease. First-line gefitinib for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who were selected on the basis of EGFR mutations improved progression-free survival, with acceptable toxicity, as compared with standard chemotherapy.

No significant associations were found between time when fruits or vegetables were introduced and the studied diseases. Associations were independent of the child's sex and parent's ownership of the current residence. Longer duration BF was only significantly protective when there was no family history of atopy.|This study suggests that heredity, but not sex and socioeconomic status, may negatively impact the effect of BF on childhood airway and allergic diseases. Our findings support China's national recommendation that mothers provide exclusive BF for the first four months, and continue partial BF for more than six months.",nonCancer

1322,A B-Cell Superantigen Induces the Apoptosis of Murine and Human Malignant B Cells.,"B-cell superantigens (Sags) bind to conserved sites of the VH or VL regions of immunoglobulin molecules outside their complementarity-determining regions causing the apoptosis of normal cognate B cells. No attempts to investigate whether B-cell Sags are able to induce the apoptosis of cognate malignant B cells were reported. In the present study we show that protein L (PpL), secreted by Finegoldia magna, a B-cell Sag which interacts with κ+ bearing cells, induces the apoptosis of murine and human κ+ lymphoma B cells both in vitro and in vivo. Apoptosis was not altered by caspase-8 inhibitor. No alterations in the levels of Bid, Fas and Fas-L were found suggesting that PpL does not activate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. The involvement of the intrinsic pathway was clearly indicated by: i) alterations in mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) both in murine and human lymphoma cells exposed to PpL; ii) decreased levels of apoptosis in the presence of caspase-9 inhibitor; iii) significant increases of Bim and Bax protein levels and downregulation of Bcl-2; iv) the translocation from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria of Bax and Bim pro-apoptotic proteins and its inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor but not by caspase-8 inhibitor and v) the translocation of Bcl-2 protein from the mitochondria to the cytosol and its inhibition by caspase-9 inhibitor but not by caspase-8 inhibitor. The possibility of a therapeutic use of Sags in lymphoma/leukemia B cell malignancies is discussed.",nonCancer
808,BRAFV600E Mutations in High-Grade Colorectal Neuroendocrine Tumors May Predict Responsiveness to BRAF-MEK Combination Therapy.,"Neuroendocrine tumors comprise a heterogeneous group of malignancies with a broad spectrum of clinical behavior. Poorly differentiated tumors follow an aggressive course with limited treatment options, and new approaches are needed. Oncogenic BRAF V600E (BRAF(V600E)) substitutions are observed primarily in melanoma, colon cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer, but have been identified in multiple tumor types. Here, we describe the first reported recurrent BRAF(V600E) mutations in advanced high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and identify a BRAF alteration frequency of 9% in 108 cases. Among these BRAF alterations, 80% were BRAF(V600E) Dramatic response to BRAF-MEK combination therapy occurred in two cases of metastatic high-grade rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma refractory to standard therapy. Urinary BRAF(V600E) circulating tumor DNA monitoring paralleled disease response. Our series represents the largest study of genomic profiling in colorectal neuroendocrine tumors and provides strong evidence that BRAF(V600E) is an oncogenic driver responsive to BRAF-MEK combination therapy in this molecular subset. BRAF(V600E) is an established oncogenic driver, but significant disparities in response exist among tumor types. Two patients with treatment-refractory high-grade colorectal neuroendocrine tumors harboring BRAF(V600E) exhibited rapid and durable response to combined BRAF-MEK inhibition, providing the first clinical evidence of efficacy in this aggressive tumor type.

1970,Reducing Transfusions in Critically Injured Patients Using a Restricted-Criteria Order Set.,"We sought to examine the effect on blood usage of a new electronic order set restricting transfusion orders to specific evidence-based criteria for each unit (U) of red blood cells (RBC), plasma, and platelets.|Prospectively collected transfusion data for Trauma ICU patients were compared for the 12 months before (PRE) and 8 months after (POST) order set implementation. Criteria for RBC transfusion were: 1U only for hemoglobin <7 g/dL in stable patients or <8 g/dL with angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiogenic shock; 2U for hemoglobin <5 g/dL; multiple U in the presence of shock, hypotension, or bleeding. Restrictive ordering criteria were also applied to plasma and platelets. Massive transfusion patients were excluded. Differences in demographics and outcomes were assessed with Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney test or Wilcoxon rank sum test for continuous variables, and χ test for categorical variables. The percentage of patients receiving transfusions over time was compared with trend tests. Severity of illness (SOI) was graded from 1 (minor) to 4 (extreme).|Of 1,038 Trauma ICU patients (583 PRE, 455 POST), 228(22%) were transfused. Median SOI [IQR] (4 [3-4] v. 4 [3-4]) and mortality (24.3% v. 22.5%, p=0.757) were similar for PRE and POST transfused patients, respectively. The percentage of patients getting transfused decreased for all transfusions (25.4% v. 17.6%, p=0.003), RBC (19.9% v. 11.2%, p<0.001), and plasma (9.3% v. 5.9%, p=0.047) in PRE and POST, respectively.

754,"Phase II study of selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) plus irinotecan as second-line therapy in patients with K-RAS mutated colorectal cancer.","More than half of colorectal tumors harbor activating mutations in RAS/RAF proteins. Selumetinib (AZD6244, ARRY-142886) is a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting MEK kinase, downstream of RAS. We examined the efficacy and safety of selumetinib with irinotecan in second-line therapy. Patients with K-RAS mutated colorectal cancer, progressing on first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy with bevacizumab, were eligible for this multicenter open-label phase I/II trial. In part A, a dose was determined using a standard ""3 + 3"" design; in part B, efficacy was determined. The primary endpoint was RECIST response rate. Historical data for irinotecan were used as reference. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival and overall survival. Thirty-two patients entered the study, and 31 were treated. All had K-RAS exon 2 mutated tumors. In phase I, the recommended oral dose of selumetinib was 75 mg twice per day with intravenous (IV) irinotecan, 180 mg/m² every 2 weeks. Three patients (9.7 %) had partial response . Sixteen patients (51.6 %) had stable disease for ≥4 weeks, including three >1 year. The most common grade 3 adverse events included diarrhea, neutropenia, fatigue, anemia, nausea, and dehydration. The study was terminated before a pre-planned accrual of 45 subjects. Despite termination before full accrual, the point estimates of RR and median PFS show promising results, suggesting that further investigations of MEK inhibition in the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer are warranted. Studies combining MEK inhibitors with cytotoxics or other targeted agents may lead to improved clinical activity based on the emerging preclinical data.",cancer
195,Resistance mechanisms for the Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor ibrutinib.,"Ibrutinib is an irreversible inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and is effective in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Resistance to irreversible kinase inhibitors and resistance associated with BTK inhibition have not been characterized. Although only a small proportion of patients have had a relapse during ibrutinib therapy, an understanding of resistance mechanisms is important. We evaluated patients with relapsed disease to identify mutations that may mediate ibrutinib resistance. We performed whole-exome sequencing at baseline and the time of relapse on samples from six patients with acquired resistance to ibrutinib therapy. We then performed functional analysis of identified mutations. In addition, we performed Ion Torrent sequencing for identified resistance mutations on samples from nine patients with prolonged lymphocytosis. We identified a cysteine-to-serine mutation in BTK at the binding site of ibrutinib in five patients and identified three distinct mutations in PLCγ2 in two patients. Functional analysis showed that the C481S mutation of BTK results in a protein that is only reversibly inhibited by ibrutinib. The R665W and L845F mutations in PLCγ2 are both potentially gain-of-function mutations that lead to autonomous B-cell-receptor activity. These mutations were not found in any of the patients with prolonged lymphocytosis who were taking ibrutinib. Resistance to the irreversible BTK inhibitor ibrutinib often involves mutation of a cysteine residue where ibrutinib binding occurs. This finding, combined with two additional mutations in PLCγ2 that are immediately downstream of BTK, underscores the importance of the B-cell-receptor pathway in the mechanism of action of ibrutinib in CLL.

To assess the efficacy of selumetinib, a selective, non-adenosine triphosphate competitive inhibitor of MEK1 and MEK2, in uveal melanoma. Randomized, open-label, phase 2 clinical trial comparing selumetinib vs chemotherapy conducted from August 2010 through December 2013 among 120 patients with metastatic uveal melanoma at 15 academic oncology centers in the United States and Canada. One hundred one patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive selumetinib, 75 mg orally twice daily on a continual basis (n = 50), or chemotherapy (temozolomide, 150 mg/m2 orally daily for 5 of every 28 days, or dacarbazine, 1000 mg/m2 intravenously every 21 days [investigator choice]; n = 51) until disease progression, death, intolerable adverse effects, or withdrawal of consent. After primary outcome analysis, 19 patients were registered and 18 treated with selumetinib without randomization to complete the planned 120-patient enrollment. Patients in the chemotherapy group could receive selumetinib at the time of radiographic progression. Progression-free survival, the primary end point, was assessed as of April 22, 2013. Additional end points, including overall survival, response rate, and safety/toxicity, were assessed as of December 31, 2013. Median progression-free survival among patients randomized to chemotherapy was 7 weeks (95% CI, 4.3-8.4 weeks; median treatment duration, 8 weeks; interquartile range [IQR], 4.3-16 weeks) and among those randomized to selumetinib was 15.9 weeks (95% CI, 8.4-21.1 weeks; median treatment duration, 16.1 weeks; IQR, 8.1-25.3 weeks) (hazard ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.71; P < .001). Median overall survival time was 9.1 months (95% CI, 6.1-11.1 months) with chemotherapy and 11.8 months (95% CI, 9.8-15.7 months) with selumetinib (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.41-1.06; P = .09). No objective responses were observed with chemotherapy. Forty-nine percent of patients treated with selumetinib achieved tumor regression, with 14% achieving an objective radiographic response to therapy. Treatment-related adverse events were observed in 97% of patients treated with selumetinib, with 37% requiring at least 1 dose reduction. In this hypothesis-generating study of patients with advanced uveal melanoma, selumetinib compared with chemotherapy resulted in a modestly improved progression-free survival and response rate; however, no improvement in overall survival was observed. Improvement in clinical outcomes was accompanied by a high rate of adverse events. clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT01143402.",cancer
2134,Supporting Reporting: On the Positive Effects of Text- and Video-Based Awareness Material on Responsible Journalistic Suicide News Writing.,"Suicide is a global public health problem. Media impact on suicide is well confirmed and there are several recommendations on how media should and should not report on suicide to minimize the risk of copycat behavior. Those media guidelines have been developed to improve responsible reporting on suicide (RRS). Although such guidelines are used in several countries, we lack empirical evidence on their causal effect on actual journalistic news writing. We conducted an experiment with journalism students (N = 78) in Germany in which we tested whether exposure to awareness material promoting RRS influences news writing. As a supplement to the widely used text-based material, we tested the impact of a video in which a suicide expert presents the guidelines. A video was used as a supplement to text partly due to its potential benefit for prevention efforts over the Internet. We chose a low-budget production process allowing easy reproduction in different countries by local suicide experts. In the experiment, participants were either exposed to written, audio-visual, or no awareness material. Afterwards, participants read numerous facts of an ostensible suicide event and were asked to write a factual suicide news story based on these facts. Analyses indicate that awareness material exposure helped to improve RRS with the awareness video showing the strongest effects. We recommend that suicide prevention should use instructive awareness videos about RRS complementary to text-based awareness material.",nonCancer
452,"Erlotinib versus standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for European patients with advanced EGFR mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (EURTAC): a multicentre, open-label, randomised phase 3 trial.","Erlotinib has been shown to improve progression-free survival compared with chemotherapy when given as first-line treatment for Asian patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with activating EGFR mutations. We aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of erlotinib compared with standard chemotherapy for first-line treatment of European patients with advanced EGFR-mutation positive NSCLC. We undertook the open-label, randomised phase 3 EURTAC trial at 42 hospitals in France, Italy, and Spain. Eligible participants were adults (> 18 years) with NSCLC and EGFR mutations (exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21) with no history of chemotherapy for metastatic disease (neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy ending ≥ 6 months before study entry was allowed). We randomly allocated participants (1:1) according to a computer-generated allocation schedule to receive oral erlotinib 150 mg per day or 3 week cycles of standard intravenous chemotherapy of cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 plus docetaxel (75 mg/m(2) on day 1) or gemcitabine (1250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8). Carboplatin (AUC 6 with docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) or AUC 5 with gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2)) was allowed in patients unable to have cisplatin. Patients were stratified by EGFR mutation type and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) in the intention-to-treat population. We assessed safety in all patients who received study drug (≥ 1 dose). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00446225. Between Feb 15, 2007, and Jan 4, 2011, 174 patients with EGFR mutations were enrolled. One patient received treatment before randomisation and was thus withdrawn from the study; of the remaining patients, 86 were randomly assigned to receive erlotinib and 87 to receive standard chemotherapy. The preplanned interim analysis showed that the study met its primary endpoint; enrolment was halted, and full evaluation of the results was recommended. At data cutoff (Jan 26, 2011), median PFS was 9·7 months (95% CI 8·4-12·3) in the erlotinib group, compared with 5·2 months (4·5-5·8) in the standard chemotherapy group (hazard ratio 0·37, 95% CI 0·25-0·54; p < 0·0001). Main grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (11 [13%] of 84 patients given erlotinib vs none of 82 patients in the chemotherapy group), neutropenia (none vs 18 [22%]), anaemia (one [1%] vs three [4%]), and increased amino-transferase concentrations (two [2%] vs 0). Five (6%) patients on erlotinib had treatment-related severe adverse events compared with 16 patients (20%) on chemotherapy. One patient in the erlotinib group and two in the standard chemotherapy group died from treatment-related causes. Our findings strengthen the rationale for routine baseline tissue-based assessment of EGFR mutations in patients with NSCLC and for treatment of mutation-positive patients with EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitors.

2361,Validating faecal glucocorticoid metabolite analysis in the Virunga mountain gorilla using a natural biological stressor.,"The continued degradation of primate habitat worldwide is forcing many primate populations into small protected forest islands surrounded by high-density human populations. One well-studied example is the critically endangered mountain gorilla (Gorilla beringei beringei). Decades of monitoring and research on Rwanda's mountain gorillas offer a unique opportunity to use non-invasive endocrine analysis to address pressing questions about the conservation of this endangered population. The aims of our study were as follows: (i) to validate field and laboratory methods for assessing stress through faecal glucocorticoid metabolite (FGM) analysis using inter-social unit interactions as a natural stressor; (ii) to determine the excretion lag times between interactions and detectable stress response in faeces; and (iii) to determine whether there are circadian patterns of FGM excretion. We collected ~6000 faecal samples from 127 known gorillas in 10 habituated groups, monitored by the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund's Karisoke Research Center over 21 months in 2011 and 2012. Extracted FGMs were measured using a cortisol enzyme immunoassay (R4866; C. J. Munro). Results revealed cause-effect relationships between inter-unit interactions and increased FGMs (relative to individual pre-event samples) between 20 and 140 h after interactions, with the peak most often occurring on day 3. There was no evidence of circadian patterns in FGM concentrations, as previously shown in many species with long gut passage times. However, baseline FGM concentrations were lower in adult males than in adult females, and variation was associated with the collection month, indicating possible seasonal variation. This study provides a biologically validated, field-friendly faecal hormone metabolite extraction and laboratory enzyme immunoassay analysis method for non-invasive monitoring of adrenocortical activity in Virunga mountain gorillas. The methods are useful for future evaluation of a variety of environmental and human-induced potential stressors in this critically endangered population.",nonCancer
1144,"Aspirin use, tumor PIK3CA mutation, and colorectal-cancer survival.","Regular use of aspirin after a diagnosis of colon cancer has been associated with a superior clinical outcome. Experimental evidence suggests that inhibition of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2) (also known as cyclooxygenase-2) by aspirin down-regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling activity. We hypothesized that the effect of aspirin on survival and prognosis in patients with cancers characterized by mutated PIK3CA (the phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphonate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha polypeptide gene) might differ from the effect among those with wild-type PIK3CA cancers. We obtained data on 964 patients with rectal or colon cancer from the Nurses' Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, including data on aspirin use after diagnosis and the presence or absence of PIK3CA mutation. We used a Cox proportional-hazards model to compute the multivariate hazard ratio for death. We examined tumor markers, including PTGS2, phosphorylated AKT, KRAS, BRAF, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype, and methylation of long interspersed nucleotide element 1. Among patients with mutated-PIK3CA colorectal cancers, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with superior colorectal cancer-specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio for cancer-related death, 0.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.06 to 0.61; P<0.001 by the log-rank test) and overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio for death from any cause, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.31 to 0.94; P=0.01 by the log-rank test). In contrast, among patients with wild-type PIK3CA, regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was not associated with colorectal cancer-specific survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.32; P=0.76 by the log-rank test; P=0.009 for interaction between aspirin and PIK3CA variables) or overall survival (multivariate hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.17; P=0.96 by the log-rank test; P=0.07 for interaction). Regular use of aspirin after diagnosis was associated with longer survival among patients with mutated-PIK3CA colorectal cancer, but not among patients with wild-type PIK3CA cancer. The findings from this molecular pathological epidemiology study suggest that the PIK3CA mutation in colorectal cancer may serve as a predictive molecular biomarker for adjuvant aspirin therapy.

1021,Association between germline homeobox B13 (HOXB13) G84E allele and prostate cancer susceptibility: a meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis.,"Germline HOXB13 G84E mutation (rs138213197) has been described associated with prostate cancer (PCa) susceptibility but results of different studies are inconsistent. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate the specific role of this mutation. Relevant available studies were identified by searching the databases Pubmed, Embase and Web of Science. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to measure the strength of the association. Subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate the specific role of rs138213197 in disease aggressiveness, diagnostic age and family history. Furthermore, trial sequential analysis (TSA) was conducted for the first time to estimate whether the evidence of the results is sufficient. Our results indicated that significant increased PCa susceptibility was associated with rs138213197 compared with non-carriers (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 2.45-4.66). Besides, in subgroup analysis, HOXB13 G84E variant was obviously associated with early onset (OR = 2.90, 95% CI: 2.24-3.75), affected relatives (OR = 2.60, 95% CI 2.19-3.10) and highly aggressive disease (OR = 2.38, 95% CI 1.84-3.08). By TSA, the findings in the current study were based on sufficient evidence. Therefore, our results indicated that the G84E mutation in HOXB13 gene might increase susceptibility to PCa.",cancer
952,MEN1 mutations in Hürthle cell (oncocytic) thyroid carcinoma.,"Oncocytic thyroid carcinoma, also known as Hürthle cell thyroid carcinoma, accounts for only a small percentage of all thyroid cancers. However, this malignancy often presents at an advanced stage and poses unique challenges to patients and clinicians. Surgical resection of the tumor accompanied in some cases by radioactive iodine treatment, radiation, and chemotherapy are the established modes of therapy. Knowledge of the perturbed oncogenic pathways can provide better understanding of the mechanism of disease and thus opportunities for more effective clinical management. Initially, two oncocytic thyroid carcinomas and their matched normal tissues were profiled using whole genome sequencing. Subsequently, 72 oncocytic thyroid carcinomas, one cell line, and five Hürthle cell adenomas were examined by targeted sequencing for the presence of mutations in the multiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN1) gene. Here we report the identification of MEN1 loss-of-function mutations in 4% of patients diagnosed with oncocytic thyroid carcinoma. Whole genome sequence data also revealed large regions of copy number variation encompassing nearly the entire genomes of these tumors. Menin, a ubiquitously expressed nuclear protein, is a well-characterized tumor suppressor whose loss is the cause of MEN1 syndrome. Menin is involved in several major cellular pathways such as regulation of transcription, control of cell cycle, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair pathways. Mutations of this gene in a subset of Hürthle cell tumors point to a potential role for this protein and its associated pathways in thyroid tumorigenesis.",cancer
138,The selective class I PI3K inhibitor CH5132799 targets human cancers harboring oncogenic PIK3CA mutations.,"The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation and survival in human cancer. PIK3CA mutations, which are found in many cancer patients, activate the PI3K pathway, resulting in cancer development and progression. We previously identified CH5132799 as a novel PI3K inhibitor. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the biochemical and antitumor activity of CH5132799 and elucidate the correlation between CH5132799 response and genetic alterations in the PI3K pathway. Kinase inhibitory activity was profiled in cell-free assays. A large panel of human breast, ovarian, prostate, and endometrial cancer cell lines, as well as xenograft models, were used to evaluate the antitumor activity of CH5132799, followed by analysis for genetic alterations. Effects on Akt phosphorylation induced by mTORC1 inhibition were tested with CH5132799 and compared with mTORC1 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitors. CH5132799 selectively inhibited class I PI3Ks and PI3Kα mutants in in vitro kinase assays. Tumors harboring PIK3CA mutations were significantly sensitive to CH5132799 in vitro and were remarkably regressed by CH5132799 in in vivo mouse xenograft models. In combination with trastuzumab, tumors disappeared in the trastuzumab-insensitive breast cancer model with the PIK3CA mutation. Moreover, CH5132799 did not reverse a negative feedback loop of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling and induced regression against tumors regrown after long-term mTORC1 inhibitor treatment. CH5132799 is a selective class I PI3K inhibitor with potent antitumor activity against tumors harboring the PIK3CA mutations. Prediction of CH5132799 response on the basis of PIK3CA mutations could enable patient stratification in clinical settings.",cancer
2224,Evaluation of the Flexural Strength of Interim Restorative Materials in Fixed Prosthodontics.,"Mechanical properties of interim restorations are considered as important factors specially when selecting materials for long-term application or for patients with para-functional habits. Flexural strength is one of the most important components of these restorations.|The purpose of this study was to compare the flexural strength of five interim restorative materials.|Fifty identical samples sized 25×2×2-mm were made from five interim materials (TempSpan; Protemp 4, Unifast III, Trim, and Revotek LC) according to ADA specification #27. The specimens were stored in artificial saliva for 2 weeks and then thermocycled for 2500 cycles (5-55˚C). A standard three-point bending test was conducted on the specimens with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.75mm/min. Data were analyzed by using one-way ANOVA and Tamhane's post-hoc tests to measure the flexural strength of temporary materials.|One of the bis-acryl resins (TempSpan) showed the highest, and the light polymerized resin (Revotek LC) showed the lowest flexural strength. The mean values of flexural strength (MPa) for the examined materials were as follow: TempSpan=120.00, Protemp 4=113.00, Unifast III=64.20, Trim= 63.73 and Revotek LC=47.16. There were significant differences between all materials except Trim and Unifast III which did not show any statistical significant difference.|Bis-acryl resins were statistically superior to traditional methacrylate and light-cured resins. Therefore, application of bis-acryl resins should be deliberated in patients with heavy occlusion and in cases that need long-term use of interim restorations.",nonCancer

440,Receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB4 mediates acquired resistance to ERBB2 inhibitors in breast cancer cells.,"Approximately 25% of breast cancers overexpress and depend on the receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB2, one of 4 ERBB family members. Targeted therapies directed against ERBB2 have been developed and used clinically, but many patients continue to develop resistance to such therapies. Although much effort has been focused on elucidating the mechanisms of acquired resistance to ERBB2-targeted therapies, the involvement of ERBB4 remains elusive and controversial. We demonstrate that genetic ablation of ERBB4, but not ERBB1-3, led to apoptosis in lapatinib-resistant cells, suggesting that the efficacy of pan-ERBB inhibitors was, at least in part, mediated by the inhibition of ERBB4. Moreover, ERBB4 was upregulated at the protein level in ERBB2+ breast cancer cell lines selected for acquired lapatinib resistance in vitro and in MMTV-Neu mice following prolonged lapatinib treatment. Knockdown of ERBB4 caused a decrease in AKT phosphorylation in resistant cells but not in sensitive cells, suggesting that ERBB4 activated the PI3K/AKT pathway in lapatinib-resistant cells. Importantly, ERBB4 knockdown triggered apoptosis not only in lapatinib-resistant cells but also in trastuzumab-resistant cells. Our results suggest that although ERBB4 is dispensable for naïve ERBB2+ breast cancer cells, it may play a key role in the survival of ERBB2+ cancer cells after they develop resistance to ERBB2 inhibitors, lapatinib and trastuzumab.",cancer
1334,Influence of Sulfate-Reducing Bacteria on the Corrosion Behavior of High Strength Steel EQ70 under Cathodic Polarization.,"Certain species of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) use cathodes as electron donors for metabolism, and this electron transfer process may influence the proper protection potential choice for structures. The interaction between SRB and polarized electrodes had been the focus of numerous investigations. In this paper, the impact of cathodic protection (CP) on Desulfovibrio caledoniens metabolic activity and its influence on highs trength steel EQ70 were studied by bacterial analyses and electrochemical measurements. The results showed that EQ70 under -0.85 VSCE CP had a higher corrosion rate than that without CP, while EQ70 with -1.05 VSCE had a lower corrosion rate. The enhanced SRB metabolic activity at -0.85 VSCE was most probably caused by the direct electron transfer from the electrode polarized at -0.85 VSCE. This direct electron transfer pathway was unavailable in -1.05 VSCE. In addition, the application of cathodic protection led to the transformation of sulfide rusts into carbonates rusts. These observations have been employed to provide updated recommendations for the optimum CP potential for steel structures in the presence of SRB.",nonCancer
1545,Role of Insulinlike Growth Factor 1 in Fetal Development and in the Early Postnatal Life of Premature Infants.,"The neonatal period of very preterm infants is often characterized by a difficult adjustment to extrauterine life, with an inadequate nutrient supply and insufficient levels of growth factors, resulting in poor growth and a high morbidity rate. Long-term multisystem complications include cognitive, behavioral, and motor dysfunction as a result of brain damage as well as visual and hearing deficits and metabolic disorders that persist into adulthood. Insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) is a major regulator of fetal growth and development of most organs especially the central nervous system including the retina. Glucose metabolism in the developing brain is controlled by IGF-1 which also stimulates differentiation and prevents apoptosis. Serum concentrations of IGF-1 decrease to very low levels after very preterm birth and remain low for most of the perinatal development. Strong correlations have been found between low neonatal serum concentrations of IGF-1 and poor brain and retinal growth as well as poor general growth with multiorgan morbidities, such as intraventricular hemorrhage, retinopathy of prematurity, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Experimental and clinical studies indicate that early supplementation with IGF-1 can improve growth in catabolic states and reduce brain injury after hypoxic/ischemic events. A multicenter phase II study is currently underway to determine whether intravenous replacement of human recombinant IGF-1 up to normal intrauterine serum concentrations can improve growth and development and reduce prematurity-associated morbidities.",nonCancer
1822,RPCVD growth of isolated Ge crystals and suspended layers on micrometric Si pillars.,"In this work, we demonstrate the growth of Ge crystals and suspended continuous layers on Si(001) substrates deeply patterned in high aspect-ratio pillars. The material deposition was carried out in a commercial reduced-pressure chemical vapor deposition (RPCVD) reactor, thus extending the ""vertical-heteroepitaxy"" technique developed by using the peculiar Low-energy plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition reactor (LEPECVD), to widely available epitaxial tools. The growth process was thoroughly analyzed, from the formation of small initial seeds to the final coalescence into a continuous suspended layer, by means of Scanning- and Transmission electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction, and μ-Raman spectroscopy. The pre-oxidation of the Si pillars sidewalls and the addition of hydrochloric gas in the reactants proved to be key to achieve highly selective Ge growth on the pillars top only, which, in turn, is needed to promote the formation of a continuous Ge layer. Thanks to continuum growth models we were able to single out the different roles played by thermodynamics and kinetics in the deposition dynamics. We believe that our findings will open the way to the low-cost realization of tens of µm thick heteroepitaxial layer (e.g. Ge, SiC, GaAs) on Si having high crystal quality.",nonCancer
2015,Efficacy of D5F3 IHC for detecting ALK gene rearrangement in NSCLC patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We conducted a pooled analysis comparing the efficacy of an immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay using the D5F3 antibody with that of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for detecting ALK gene rearrangement in NSCLC patients. A total of 32 studies involving 5805 samples were included in this review. Pooled sensitivity for D5F3 IHC was 0.97 (95%CI: 0.93-0.98), specificity was 0.99 (95%CI: 0.98-1.00), PLR was 119.20 (95%CI: 57.79-245.89), NLR was 0.03 (95%CI: 0.02-0.07), DOR was 3526.66 (95%CI: 1344.71-9249.03), and AUROC was 1.00 (95%CI: 0.99-1.00). Meta-regression revealed that specimen type was a source of heterogeneity for specificity, and specimen type and FISH signal distance were sources of heterogeneity in the joint model. Subgroup analysis revealed that sensitivity and specificity were higher when the FISH signal distance standard was ≥ 2 than when it was ≥ 1. Sensitivity was higher for tumor specimens than for cell specimens; specificity was higher for cell specimens than for tumor specimens. In conclusion, the D5F3 IHC assay was nearly as effective as FISH for detection of ALK gene rearrangement in NSCLC patients.",nonCancer
1898,Lonicera caerulea berry extract suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation via Toll-like receptor and oxidative stress-associated mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.,"The protective effects of Lonicera caerulea berry extract (LCBE) against hepatic inflammation and the underlying mechanisms were investigated in a rat model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced chronic liver inflammation. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with LPS (200 μg per kg bw) with or without LCBE co-administration (50, 100 and 200 mg per kg bw intragastrically once daily) for 4 weeks. We found that LCBE supplementation inhibited the increase in Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 expression induced by LPS, while preventing glutathione depletion and reactive oxidative species generation and abrogating increases in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels, restoring alanine and aspartate aminotransferase activities, and blocking the phosphorylation of p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). The protective effects of LCBE against liver damage caused by LPS were dose-dependent. These results demonstrate that LCBE suppresses liver inflammation caused by LPS via inhibition of TLR and MAPK signaling and oxidative stress pathways, and suggest that LCBE treatment can potentially prevent chronic liver injury.",nonCancer
880,Targeting Mutant BRAF in Relapsed or Refractory Hairy-Cell Leukemia.,"BRAF V600E is the genetic lesion underlying hairy-cell leukemia. We assessed the safety and activity of the oral BRAF inhibitor vemurafenib in patients with hairy-cell leukemia that had relapsed after treatment with a purine analogue or who had disease that was refractory to purine analogues. We conducted two phase 2, single-group, multicenter studies of vemurafenib (at a dose of 960 mg twice daily)--one in Italy and one in the United States. The therapy was administered for a median of 16 weeks in the Italian study and 18 weeks in the U.S. study. Primary end points were the complete response rate (in the Italian trial) and the overall response rate (in the U.S. trial). Enrollment was completed (28 patients) in the Italian trial in April 2013 and is still open (26 of 36 planned patients) in the U.S. trial. The overall response rates were 96% (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median of 8 weeks in the Italian study and 100% (24 of 24) after a median of 12 weeks in the U.S. study. The rates of complete response were 35% (9 of 26 patients) and 42% (10 of 24) in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian trial, after a median follow-up of 23 months, the median relapse-free survival was 19 months among patients with a complete response and 6 months among those with a partial response; the median treatment-free survival was 25 months and 18 months, respectively. In the U.S. trial, at 1 year, the progression-free survival rate was 73% and the overall survival rate was 91%. Drug-related adverse events were usually of grade 1 or 2, and the events most frequently leading to dose reductions were rash and arthralgia or arthritis. Secondary cutaneous tumors (treated with simple excision) developed in 7 of 50 patients. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism. A short oral course of vemurafenib was highly effective in patients with relapsed or refractory hairy-cell leukemia.

1943,No Difference in Overall Survival Between Hospital Volumes for Patients With Colorectal Cancer in The Netherlands.,"High-volume hospitals have been associated with improved patient outcomes for tumors with a relatively low incidence that require complex surgeries, such as esophageal and pancreatic cancer. The volume-outcome association for colorectal cancer is under debate.|This study investigated whether hospital volume for colorectal cancer is associated with surgical care characteristics and 5-year overall survival.|This is a population-based study.|Data were gathered from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Hospitals were grouped by volume for colon (<50, 50-74, 75-99, and ≥100 resections per year) and rectum (<20, 20-39, and ≥40 resections per year).|All of the patients with primary nonmetastatic colorectal cancer who underwent resection between 2005 and 2012 were included.|Differences in surgical approach, anastomotic leakage, and postoperative 30-day mortality between hospital volumes were analyzed using χ tests and multivariable logistic regression analyses. Cox proportional hazard models were used to investigate the effect of hospital volume on overall survival.|This study included 61,394 patients with colorectal cancer. In 2012, 31 of the 91 hospitals performed less than 50 colon cancer resections per year, and 21 of the 90 hospitals performed less than 20 rectal cancer resections per year. No differences in anastomotic leakage rates between hospital volumes were observed. Only small differences between hospital volumes were revealed for conversion of laparoscopic to open resection (OR of less than 50 versus 100 or more resections per year = 1.25 (95% CI, 1.06-1.46)) and postoperative 30-day mortality (colon: OR of less than 50 versus 100 or more resections per year = 1.17 (95% CI, 1.02-1.35); rectum: OR of less than 20 versus 40 or more resections per year = 1.42 (95% CI, 1.09-1.84)). No differences in overall survival were found between hospital volumes.|Although we adjusted for several patient and tumour characteristics, data regarding comorbidity, surgeon volume, local recurrences, and specific postoperative complications other than anastomotic leakage were not available.|In the Netherlands, no differences in 5-year survival rates were revealed between hospital volumes for patients with nonmetastatic colorectal cancer.",nonCancer
930,Elevated Serum Gas6 Is a Novel Prognostic Biomarker in Patients with Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma.,"This study explored the level and clinical significance of serum Gas6 in patients with oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). A total of 128 OSCC patients and 145 normal controls were selected. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect Gas6 concentration in sera from the OSCC patients and controls. The correlations of serum Gas6 concentration and clinicopathological characteristics of OSCC patients were assessed, and the prognostic significance of serum Gas6 was evaluated with a Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test. The results showed that serum Gas6 concentration was significantly higher in OSCC patients than in controls (P < 0.05). OSCC patients with late TNM stage (III, IV) had a relatively high serum Gas6 concentration compared with those with early stage (I, II) (P < 0.01) and patients with poorly differentiated tumors had a higher level of serum Gas6 than those with well-differentiated tumors (P < 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that high serum Gas6 was an independent risk factor for lymph nodal metastases in OSCC patients (OR = 2.79, 95% CI: 1.72-4.48). For predicting OSCC development, ROC curve analysis showed a sensitivity of 0.63 with a specificity of 0.92 (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.74-0.85). Cox analysis revealed that high serum Gas6 was an independent biomarker for predicting poor overall survival in OSCC patients (HR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.79-3.62). In addition, we found that Gas6 expression was increased in OSCC tissues and it may significantly decrease E-cadherin expression, and increase P-cadherin and N-cadherin expression, in OSCC cells. Further, Gas6 could promote the migratory and invasive ability of OSCC cells in vitro. Taken together, these results suggest that Gas6 increases the metastatic capacity of OSCC cells and serum Gas6 could be a candidate biomarker for diagnostic and prognostic use in OSCC patients.",cancer
671,Genomic alterations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase may sensitize tumors to anaplastic lymphoma kinase inhibitors.,"Selective kinase inhibitors have had a substantial impact on the field of medical oncology. Whereas these agents can elicit dramatic clinical responses in some settings, their activity is generally limited to a subset of treated patients whose tumor cells harbor a specific genetic lesion. We have established an automated platform for examining the sensitivity to various molecularly targeted inhibitors across a large panel of human tumor-derived cell lines to identify additional genotype-correlated responses that may be clinically relevant. Among the inhibitors tested in a panel of 602 cell lines derived from a variety of human cancers, we found that a selective inhibitor of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) potently suppressed growth of a small subset of tumor cells. This subset included lines derived from anaplastic large cell lymphomas, non-small-cell lung cancers, and neuroblastomas. ALK is a receptor tyrosine kinase that was first identified as part of a protein fusion derived from a chromosomal translocation detected in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphoma patients, and has recently been implicated as an oncogene in a small fraction of non-small-cell lung cancers and neuroblastomas. Significantly, sensitivity in these cell lines was well correlated with specific ALK genomic rearrangements, including chromosomal translocations and gene amplification. Moreover, in such cell lines, ALK kinase inhibition can lead to potent suppression of downstream survival signaling and an apoptotic response. These findings suggest that a subset of lung cancers, lymphomas, and neuroblastomas that harbor genomic ALK alterations may be clinically responsive to pharmacologic ALK inhibition.",cancer
2132,Application of diffusional kurtosis imaging to detect occult brain damage in multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica (NMO) are two common types of inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Early distinction of NMO from MS is crucial but quite challenging. In this study, 13 NMO spectrum disorder patients (Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 3.0 ± 1.7, ranging from 2 to 6.5; disease duration of 5.3 ± 4.7 years), 17 relapsing-remitting MS patients (EDSS of 2.6 ± 1.4, ranging from 1 to 5.5; disease duration of 7.9 ± 7.8 years) and 18 healthy volunteers were recruited. Diffusional kurtosis imaging was employed to discriminate NMO and MS patients at the early or stable stage from each other, and from healthy volunteers. The presence of alterations in diffusion and diffusional kurtosis metrics in normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and diffusely increased mean diffusivity (MD) in the cortical normal-appearing gray matter (NAGM) favors the diagnosis of MS rather than NMO. Meanwhile, normal diffusivities and kurtosis metrics in all NAWM as well as increases in MD in the frontal and temporal NAGM suggest NMO. Our results suggest that diffusion and diffusional kurtosis metrics may well aid in discriminating the two diseases.",nonCancer
134,L576P KIT mutation in anal melanomas correlates with KIT protein expression and is sensitive to specific kinase inhibition.,"Activating mutations in either BRAF or NRAS are seen in a significant number of malignant melanomas, but their incidence appears to be dependent to ultraviolet light exposure. Thus, BRAF mutations have the highest incidence in non-chronic sun damaged (CSD), and are uncommon in acral, mucosal and CSD melanomas. More recently, activating KIT mutations have been described in rare cases of metastatic melanoma, without further reference to their clinical phenotypes. This finding is intriguing since KIT expression is downregulated in most melanomas progressing to more aggressive lesions. In this study, we investigated a group of anal melanomas for the presence of BRAF, NRAS, KIT and PDGFRA mutations. A heterozygous KIT exon 11 L576P substitution was identified in 3 of 20 cases tested. The 3 KIT mutation-carrying tumors were strongly immunopositive for KIT protein. No KIT mutations were identified in tumors with less than 4+ KIT immunostaining. NRAS mutation was identified in one tumor. No BRAF or PDGFRA mutations were identified in either KIT positive or negative anal melanomas. In vitro drug testing of stable transformant Ba/F3 KIT(L576P) mutant cells showed sensitivity for dasatinib (previously known as BMS-354825), a dual SRC/ABL kinase inhibitor, and imatinib. However, compared to an imatinib-sensitive KIT mutant, dasatinib was potent at lower doses than imatinib in the KIT(L576P) mutant. These results suggest that a subset of anal melanomas show activating KIT mutations, which are susceptible for therapy with specific kinase inhibitors.",cancer
108,Novel targeted therapies for Bcr-Abl positive acute leukemias: beyond STI571.,"In the pathophysiology of CML, the constitutive activity of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase (TK) is, most likely, the sole molecular abnormality of the chronic phase. It also remains a critical molecular determinant of malignant behavior of the leukemic progenitors in the accelerated and blastic phase of CML. Therefore, downregulation of the levels and activity of Bcr-Abl is clearly the lynchpin of a rational therapeutic strategy against all phases of CML. Support for this has only been strengthened by the observations that resistance to imatinib mesylate (imatinib) commonly involves a breakthrough and the persistent activity of Bcr-Abl TK. This is due to either mutations that inhibit imatinib action on Bcr-Abl TK or amplification of the bcr-abl gene. Recent studies have demonstrated that other small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors that also inhibit Bcr-Abl TK may be highly active in inducing differentiation and apoptosis of CML progenitors, regardless of their sensitivity to imatinib. Small molecule inhibitors that downregulate the levels of Bcr-Abl by inhibiting its translation, e.g., arsenic trioxide, or promoting its proteasomal degradation, e.g., geldanamycin analogues, have also been identified. Finally the identification of other potent survival and antiapoptotic signaling pathways in imatinib-resistant CML progenitors indicates that inhibitors of these pathways will eventually be treatment strategies for advanced phases of CML.",cancer

Overall, 1075 patients less than 60 years of age were randomized to receive or not receive ATRA in addition to daunorubicin/Ara-C/thioguanine chemotherapy with Ara-C at standard or double standard dose. There were data on FLT3 internal tandem duplications and NPM1 mutations (n = 592), CEBPA mutations (n = 423), and MN1 expression (n = 195). The complete remission rate was 68% with complete remission with incomplete count recovery in an additional 16%; 8-year overall survival was 32%. There was no significant treatment effect for any outcome, with no significant interactions between treatment and demographics, or cytarabine randomization. Importantly, there were no interactions by FLT3/internal tandem duplications, NPM1, or CEBPA mutation. There was a suggestion that ATRA reduced relapse in patients with lower MN1 levels, but no significant effect on overall survival. Results were consistent when restricted to patients with normal karyotype. ATRA has no overall effect on treatment outcomes in this group of patients. The study did not identify any subgroup of patients likely to derive a significant survival benefit from the addition of ATRA to chemotherapy.",cancer
1660,Statins improve outcomes of nonsurgical curative treatments in hepatocellular carcinoma patients.,"Statins are associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and have the potential to be an adjuvant agent for HCC. In this study, we examined whether statin use is associated with additional benefits among patients who received curative treatments (CTs) such as surgery, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).We conducted a cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry in 2001 to 2012. The patient cohort consisted of those who received different treatments, and we compared patients who received statins with those who did not. Statin users were defined as patients who received >28 cumulative defined daily doses after their HCC diagnosis. We used a time-dependent Cox proportional method to model the time from the HCC diagnosis to any death and HCC death between men who received statins and those who did not after adjusting for confounders. Data on statin prescriptions were collected every 6 months to define the user status.In total, 18,892 patients were included, and the mean follow-up duration was 1.74 years. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause deaths increased in HCC patients who received RFA/PEI compared to those who received surgery (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.05, with aHRs of 1.81 and 1.16, respectively, for hepatitis B virus [HBV] or non-HBV HCC). However, with the addition of statin use to RFA or PEI, the overall survival was statistically equal.Surgical resection is still superior over other therapies.

1325,Laparoscopic Repair of Giant Bochdalek Hernia in Adults.,"Bochdalek hernia is a congenital diaphragmatic defect that results from improper fusion of the septum transversum and the pleuroperitoneal folds. It rarely persists asymptomatic until adulthood. The reported incidence is as low as 0.17%. Surgical repair of the defect can be performed through the abdomen or through the chest, and in both cases open or through laparoscopy/thoracoscopy.|We present 2 cases of fully laparoscopic repair of giant Bochdalek hernia in adults. In both cases we used a GORE(®) DUALMESH(®) and we had neither complications nor recurrence. It is worthy of mention that hernia sac was not found in any of the cases. This has been described as a distinct characteristic that confirms diagnosis.|Bochdalek hernia in the adult is a rare entity that requires surgical treatment to avoid complications. CT scan of the abdomen and chest with oral and IV contrast is the gold standard for diagnosis.",nonCancer
2077,Core@double-shell Structured Nanocomposites: a Route to High Dielectric Constant and Low Loss Material.,"This work reports the advances of utilizing a core@double-shell nanostructure to enhance the electrical energy storage capability and suppress the dielectric loss of polymer nanocomposites. Two types of core@double-shell barium titanate (BaTiO3) matrix-free nanocomposites were prepared using a surface initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) method to graft a poly(2-hydroxylethyle methacrylate)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate) and sodium polyacrylate-block-poly(2-hydroxylethyle methacrylate) block copolymer from BaTiO3 nanoparticles. The inner shell polymer is chosen to have either high dielectric constant or high electrical conductivity to provide large polarization, while the encapsulating outer shell polymer is chosen to be more insulating as to maintain a large resistivity and low loss. Finite element modeling was conducted to investigate the dielectric properties of the fabricated nanocomposites and the relaxation behavior of the grafted polymer. It demonstrates that confinement of the more conductive (lossy) phase in this multi-shell nanostructure is the key to achieving a high dielectric constant and maintaining a low loss. This promising multi-shell strategy could be generalized to a variety of polymers to develop novel nanocomposites.",nonCancer
1042,Mismatch repair deficiency associated with complete remission to combination programmed cell death ligand immune therapy in a patient with sporadic urothelial carcinoma: immunotheranostic considerations.,"Mismatch repair deficiency (MMRD) is a common pathway of malignant transformation accounting for approximately 15-20 % of human carcinogensis. It has been postulated that MMRD increases tumor antigenicity and highlights a role for immunotherapeutic approach MMR-deficient cancers. This strategy was pursued in a patient with upper tract urothelial carcinoma, and the results are reported here. Molecular profiling was performed using next generation DNA sequencing and (IHC) testing for MMR and PD-L1. A patient with sporadic, high grade urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis was found to have a hypermutator genotype with 73 mutations occurring amidst 62 known drivers of malignancy, and 340 VUS alterations. MMR deficiency phenotype was confirmed by the absence of MSH2 and MSH6 as well as deleterious mutations in these genes. IHC staining for programmed cell death ligand-1 [PD-L1] revealed 2+ staining in 80 % of cells. The patient gained access to combination immunotherapy trial utilizing MEDI4736 and MEDI0680 through a clinical trial. The patient achieved a prolonged, complete remission within two months and had no severe ill effects from the treatment. Given their ability to generate neo-antigens, MMR-deficient cancers may be uniquely susceptible to immune checkpoint inhibitor strategies, including urothelial tract cancers. Screening for MMR deficient cancers has the potential to become a routine strategy for evaluating the role of PD-L1 inhibitors for patient with advanced disease. ( Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00938834.

1715,Effect of HIV-infection and cumulative viral load on age-related decline in grip strength.,"Grip strength predicts functional decline and death, and is regarded as a biomarker of biological aging. The primary objective of this manuscript was to assess differences in the rate of decline in grip strength in persons aging with and without HIV.|Grip strength was assessed in 1,552 (716 HIV+ and 836 HIV-) men ≥ 50 years participating in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study between 2007 and 2014.|Grip strength decline was modeled longitudinally, adjusting for serostatus, demographics, comorbidities, and conditions. In HIV-specificmodels, coefficients were included for cumulative viral load and history of AIDS.|Grip strength at age 50 averaged 37.9 kg and 38.2 kg for HIV+ and HIV- men, respectively (p = 0.70). In fully adjusted models, grip strength declined 0.33 kg/yr in HIV- men (p < 0.001) and 0.42 kg/yr in HIV+ men (p = 0.01). In HIV-stratified models, higher cumulative viral load indicated greater strength decline (-0.884 kg for 3.1 - 4.0 log10 copies-years/mL and -1.077 kg for ≥ 4.1 log10 copies-years/mL) relative to men with consistently low viral load (≤ 3.0 log10 copies-years/mL). Adjusted Cox proportional hazard models revealed a 70% greater risk of clinically weak grip strength in HIV+ men (aHR 1.70; 95% CI, 1.22 - 2.40).|Grip strength decline is accelerated in HIV-infected men, which may contribute to decreased life expectancy and lower quality of life with aging. Greater cumulative viral load exposure appears to be an important driver of this decline and underscores the importance of early initiation of therapy.",nonCancer
472,A practical approach to aid physician interpretation of clinically actionable predictive biomarker results in a multi-platform tumor profiling service.,"Patients in whom the standard of care has failed or who have uncommon tumors for which no standard of care exists are often treated with drugs selected based on the physician's best guess. The rate of success for this method is generally low. With the advent of fast, affordable tumor profiling technologies, and a growth in the understanding of predictive biomarkers, it is now possible to identify drugs potentially associated with clinical benefit for such patients. We present the Caris approach to evidence-based tumor profiling and two patients with advanced ovarian and prostate cancer in whom standard of care had failed and tumor profiling identified an effective treatment schedule. To establish Caris Molecular Intelligence(TM) (CMI), over 120,000 clinical publications were screened and graded to characterize the predictive value of biomarkers that form the panel of tests. CMI includes multiple technologies to measure changes in proteins, ribonucleic acid, and deoxyribonucleic acid and proprietary software that matches the test results with the published evidence. The CMI results enable physicians to select drugs that are more likely to benefit the patients, avoid drugs that are not likely to work, and find treatment options that otherwise would not be considered. Worldwide, over 60,000 cancer patients have undergone evidence-based tumor profiling with CMI. In the cases reported in this article, CMI identified treatments that would not have been routinely used in the respective clinical setting. The clinical outcomes observed help to illustrate the utility of this approach.",cancer
2534,Evolutionary Trails of Plant Group II Pyridoxal Phosphate-Dependent Decarboxylase Genes.,"Type II pyridoxal phosphate-dependent decarboxylase (PLP_deC) enzymes play important metabolic roles during nitrogen metabolism. Recent evolutionary profiling of these genes revealed a sharp expansion of histidine decarboxylase genes in the members of Solanaceae family. In spite of the high sequence homology shared by PLP_deC orthologs, these enzymes display remarkable differences in their substrate specificities. Currently, limited information is available on the gene repertoires and substrate specificities of PLP_deCs which renders their precise annotation challenging and offers technical challenges in the immediate identification and biochemical characterization of their full gene complements in plants. Herein, we explored their evolutionary trails in a comprehensive manner by taking advantage of high-throughput data accessibility and computational approaches. We discussed the premise that has enabled an improved reconstruction of their evolutionary lineage and evaluated the factors offering constraints in their rapid functional characterization, till date. We envisage that the synthesized information herein would act as a catalyst for the rapid exploration of their biochemical specificity and physiological roles in more plant species.",nonCancer

Although the hepatic artery is very important for the liver, it has to be removed when tumor invades it. Therefore, portal vein arterialization has been used in clinic as a remedial measure, but there still is professional debate on portal vein arterialization.|Here, we report 1 case that was diagnosed with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the duodenum. The tumor had large size and invaded surrounding organs and vessels.|Preliminary diagnoses were poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of the duodenum and viral hepatitis B. Pancreaticoduodenectomy assisted by 3-D visualization reconstruction and portal vein arterialization were performed in this case. The tumor was removed. Liver function returned to normal limits 1 week after operation. Digital subtraction arteriography showed compensatory artery branches within the liver 1 month after operation.|3-D visualization reconstruction can provide a reliable assistance for the accurate assessment and surgical design before pancreatoduodenectomy, and it is certainly worth adopting portal vein arterialization when retention of hepatic artery is impossible or conventional arterial anastomosis is required during pancreatoduodenectomy.",nonCancer
1476,Amending HIV drugs: a novel small-molecule approach to target lupus anti-DNA antibodies.,"Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect numerous tissues and is characterized by the production of nuclear antigen-directed autoantibodies (e.g. anti-dsDNA). Using a combination of virtual and ELISA-based screens, we made the intriguing discovery that several HIV-protease inhibitors can function as decoy antigens to specifically inhibit the binding of anti-dsDNA antibodies to target antigens such as dsDNA and pentapeptide DWEYS. Computational modeling revealed that HIV-protease inhibitors comprised structural features present in DWEYS and predicted that analogues containing more flexible backbones would possess preferred binding characteristics. To address this, we reduced the internal amide backbone to improve flexibility, producing new small-molecule decoy antigens, which neutralize anti-dsDNA antibodies in vitro, in situ, and in vivo. Pharmacokinetic and SLE model studies demonstrated that peptidomimetic FISLE-412(1), a reduced HIV protease inhibitor analogue, was well-tolerated, altered serum reactivity to DWEYS, reduced glomerular IgG deposition, preserved kidney histology, and delayed SLE onset in NZB/W F1 mice.",nonCancer
2268,Upregulation of CD4+T-Cell Derived MiR-223 in The Relapsing Phase of Multiple Sclerosis Patients.,"MicroRNAs (miRNA) are a class of non-coding RNAs which play key roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. Previous studies indicate that miRNAs are dysregulated in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Th17 and regulatory T (Treg) cells are two subsets of CD4+T-cells which have critical functions in the onset and progression of MS. The current study seeks to distinguish fluctuations in expression of CD4+T-cell derived miR-223 during the relapsing-remitting (RR) phase of MS (RR-MS), as well as the expressions of Th17 and Treg cell markers.|This experimental study used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to evaluate CD4+ T cell derived miR-223 expression patterns in patients that experienced either of the RR-MS phases (n=40) compared to healthy controls (n=12), along with RNA markers for Th17 and Treg cells. We conducted flow cytometry analyses of forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) and RAR-related orphan receptor γt (RORγt) in CD4+T-cells. Putative and validated targets of miR-223 were investigated in the miRWalk and miRTarBase databases, respectively.|miR-223 significantly upregulated in CD4+T-cells during the relapsing phase of RR-MS compared to the remitting phase (P=0.000) and healthy individuals (P=0.036). Expression of RORγt, a master transcription factor of Th17, upregulated in the relapsing phase, whereas FOXP3 upregulated in the remitting phase. Additionally, potential targets of miR-223, STAT1, FORKHEAD BOX O (FOXO1) and FOXO3 were predicted by in silico studies.|miR-223 may have a potential role in MS progression. Therefore, suppression of miR-223 can be proposed as an appropriate approach to control progression of the relapsing phase of MS.",nonCancer
1134,Correlation between IDH1 gene mutation status and survival of patients treated for recurrent glioma.,"Somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) gene have been frequently found in low-grade glioma and secondary glioblastoma and are associated with a significantly younger age at diagnosis and a superior overall survival. We investigated the IDH1 gene mutation status by nested PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) on DNA extracted from archival tumor blocks of 63 glioma patients who were treated following recurrence with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted blocking monoclonal antibody cetuximab, or the vascular endothelial growth factor (receptor) (VEGF(R))-targeted agents sunitinib malate and bevacizumab. In our study population, IDH1 mutation was significantly correlated with a longer overall survival (OS) from the time of initial diagnosis. Patients with IDH1 mutation also had a superior OS from the time of recurrence when treated with sunitinib or bevacizumab but a worse OS when treated with cetuximab. Our observations support the hypothesis that IDH1 mutation may correlate with the benefit from VEGF(R)- versus EGFR-targeted therapy at the time of recurrence in glioma patients.",cancer
2235,Oral Vitamin B12 Replacement for the Treatment of Pernicious Anemia.,"Many patients with pernicious anemia are treated with lifelong intramuscular (IM) vitamin B12 replacement. As early as the 1950s, there were studies suggesting that oral vitamin B12 replacement may provide adequate absorption. Nevertheless, oral vitamin B12 replacement in patients with pernicious anemia remains uncommon in clinical practice. The objective of this review is to provide an update on the effectiveness of oral vitamin B12 for the treatment of pernicious anemia, the recommended dosage, and the required frequency of laboratory test and clinical monitoring. Relevant articles were identified by PubMed search from January 1, 1980 to March 31, 2016 and through hand search of relevant reference articles. Two randomized controlled trials, three prospective papers, one systematic review, and three clinical reviews fulfilled our inclusion criteria. We found that oral vitamin B12 replacement at 1000 μg daily was adequate to replace vitamin B12 levels in patients with pernicious anemia. We conclude that oral vitamin B12 is an effective alternative to vitamin B12 IM injections. Patients should be offered this alternative after an informed discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options.",nonCancer

The randomized German-Austrian AML Study Group 06-04 protocol was designed on the basis of in vitro synergistic effects of valproic acid (VPA) and all-trans retinoic acid with chemotherapy. Between 2004 and 2006, 186 patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 induction cycles with idarubicin, cytarabine, and all-trans retinoic acid either with VPA or without (STANDARD). In all patients, consolidation therapy was intended. Complete remission rates after induction tended to be lower in VPA compared with STANDARD (40% vs 52%; P = .14) as a result of a higher early death rate (26% vs 14%; P = .06). The main toxicities attributed to VPA were delayed hematologic recovery and grade 3/4 infections, observed predominantly during the second induction cycle. After restricting VPA to the first induction cycle and reducing the dose of idarubicin, these toxicities dropped to rates observed in STANDARD. After a median follow-up time of 84 months, event-free and overall survival were not different between the 2 groups (P = .95 and P = .57, respectively). However, relapse-free-survival was significantly superior in VPA compared with STANDARD (24.4% vs 6.4% at 5 years; P = .02). Explorative subset analyses revealed that AML with mutated Nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) may particularly benefit from VPA. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00151255.",cancer
688,A phase II trial of Salirasib in patients with lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations.,"KRAS mutations are present in 30% of lung adenocarcinomas. Salirasib prevents Ras membrane binding thereby blocking the function of all Ras isoforms. This phase II study determined the activity of salirasib in patients with advanced lung adenocarcinomas with KRAS mutations. Two cohorts of patients with stage IIIB/IV lung adenocarcinoma were eligible: patients with tumors with KRAS mutations who were previously treated with chemotherapy and patients receiving initial therapy who had ≥15 pack-year smoking history. Salirasib was given orally from days 1 to 28 of a 35-day cycle. The primary end point was the rate of nonprogression at 10 weeks. Thirty-three patients were enrolled. Thirty patients had KRAS mutations (23 patients who were previously treated and 7/10 patients who had no prior therapy). Of the previously treated patients, 7 of 23 (30%) had stable disease at 10 weeks, and 4 of 10 (40%) previously untreated patients had stable disease at 10 weeks. No patient had a radiographic partial response (0% observed rate, 95% confidence interval 0-12%). The median overall survival was not reached (>9 months) for previously untreated patients and it was 15 months for patients who received prior chemotherapy. Diarrhea, nausea, and fatigue were the most common toxicities. Salirasib at the current dose and schedule has insufficient activity in the treatment of KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma to warrant further evaluation. The successful enrollment of 30 patients with tumors with KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma over 15 months at a single site demonstrates that drug trials directed at a KRAS-specific genotype in lung cancer are feasible.",cancer
1427,Regulatory T Cells and Cancer: A Two-Sided Story.,"Regulatory T cells (Tregs) play pivotal roles in limiting the duration and magnitude of immune response against infectious agents and self-antigens. This is accomplished through contact-dependent and -independent mechanisms that involve crosstalk between Treg cells and other immune and tissue-specific cell types. The same machinery is employed by Tregs to regulate immune responses to cancer, limiting both pro-tumor inflammation and anti-tumor immunity. Factors produced by Treg cells also act directly on transformed epithelial cells and exert opposing effects during different stages of cancer development. Therefore, the immune regulatory cell population serves as a double-edged sword for the development, progression, and treatment of cancers. In this review, we summarize current knowledge on the roles of Treg lymphocytes during cancer development, as well as the underlying cellular and molecular mechanism.",nonCancer

1233,The GNAS1 T393C polymorphism is associated with disease progression and survival in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.,"B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells. The G protein Galphas subunit has been linked to proapoptotic processes in cancer cell lines. The TT genotype of the GNAS1 T393C polymorphism is associated with increased Galphas transcript levels and a more favorable clinical course in different solid cancers. We retrospectively genotyped 144 patients with B-CLL to examine a potential association between T393C genotypes with progression-free survival (time from diagnosis to initiation of chemotherapy) and overall survival. The C-allele frequency in the patient group was 0.57 and not significantly different from that of healthy blood donors. Median progression-free survival was significantly different between genotypes (TT 130 months; TC 100 months; CC 31 months; P = 0.0066). Multivariable analysis showed that besides of ZAP-70 (P = 0.005) and Binet stage (P < 0.001), the T393C polymorphism was an independent prognostic factor for progression-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) CC versus TT 2.7; P = 0.010]. In Binet A stages, ZAP-70-positive patients with CC genotypes had a HR of 4.4 to receive first therapy compared with ZAP-70-negative patients with T-alleles (P = 0.0001). Regarding overall survival, CC genotypes (median overall survival, 197 months) were at highest risk for death compared with T-alleles (median overall survival, 310 months) in both univariate (HR, 4.8; P < 0.0001) and multivariable analysis (HR, 5.6; P = 0.002). Here, we show that the GNAS1 T393C status is a novel independent prognostic marker in patients with B-CLL. These results could help to define patients who could benefit from an early individualized therapy.",cancer
1059,Rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR) Amplification Defines a Subset of Advanced Gastric Cancer and is Sensitive to AZD2014-mediated mTORC1/2 Inhibition.,"Targeting oncogenic genomic aberrations is an established therapeutic strategy in multiple tumor types. Molecular classification has uncovered a number of novel targets, and rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR (RICTOR) amplification has been identified in lung cancer. Further investigation assessing the therapeutic potential of RICTOR amplification as a novel target across advanced cancers is needed. Tumor samples from 640 patients with metastatic solid tumors, primarily gastrointestinal and lung cancers were prospectively subjected to a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay to identify molecular targets. Samples with NGS-detected RICTOR amplification were confirmed with FISH. A RICTOR-amplified patient-derived cell (PDC) line was generated and used to investigate the effectiveness of selective AKT, mTORC1, and mTORC1/2 inhibition. NGS identified 13 (2%) of 640 patients with RICTOR-amplified tumors (6 gastric, 3 NSCLC, 1 SCLC, 1 CRC, 1 sarcoma, 1 MUO). Of the thirteen patients, 7 patients had RICTOR protein overexpression by IHC. The prevalence of RICTOR amplification in gastric cancer by NGS was 3.8 % (6/160). FISH testing confirmed amplification (RICTOR/control >2) in 5/13 (38%) of samples, including 4 gastric cancers and 1 lung cancer. Treatment of a RICTOR amplified PDC with a selective AKT (AZD5363), selective mTORC1 (everolimus), dual mTORC1/2 (AZD2014), and the multi-target kinase inhibitor pazopanib demonstrated preferential sensitivity to the mTORC1/2 inhibitor (AZD2014). Knockdown of RICTOR reversed PDC sensitivity to AZD2014, validating the importance of RICTOR amplification to the PDC line. RICTOR amplification is a rare but therapeutically relevant genomic alteration across solid tumors. Our results support further pre-clinical and clinical investigation with AZD2014 in RICTOR amplified gastric cancer and highlights the importance of genomic profiling.",cancer
1511,Uncovering cortico-striatal correlates of cognitive fatigue in pediatric acquired brain disorder: Evidence from traumatic brain injury.,"Cognitive fatigue is among the most profound and disabling sequelae of pediatric acquired brain disorders, however the neural correlates of these symptoms in children remains unexplored. One hypothesis suggests that cognitive fatigue may arise from dysfunction of cortico-striatal networks (CSNs) implicated in effort output and outcome valuation. Using pediatric traumatic brain injury (TBI) as a model, this study investigated (i) the sub-acute effect of brain injury on CSN volume; and (ii) potential relationships between cognitive fatigue and sub-acute volumetric abnormalities of the CSN. 3D T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging sequences were acquired sub-acutely in 137 children (TBI: n = 103; typically developing - TD children: n = 34). 67 of the original 137 participants (49%) completed measures of cognitive fatigue and psychological functioning at 24-months post-injury. Results showed that compared to TD controls and children with milder injuries, children with severe TBI showed volumetric reductions in the overall CSN package, as well as regional gray matter volumetric change in cortical and subcortical regions of the CSN. Significantly greater cognitive fatigue in the TBI patients was associated with volumetric reductions in the CSN and its putative hub regions, even after adjusting for injury severity, socioeconomic status (SES) and depression. In the first study to evaluate prospective neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive fatigue in pediatric acquired brain disorder, these findings suggest that post-injury cognitive fatigue is related to structural abnormalities of cortico-striatal brain networks implicated in effort output and outcome valuation. Morphometric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may have potential to unlock early prognostic markers that may assist to identify children at elevated risk for cognitive fatigue post-TBI.",nonCancer

In the process, animal models represent invaluable tools for identifying disease-related loci and their genetic components. Amongst them, the laboratory rat is used extensively in the study of many conditions and disorders. The Rat Genome Database (RGD-http://rgd.mcw.edu) has been established to house rat genetic, genomic and phenotypic data. Since its inception, it has continually expanded the depth and breadth of its content. Currently, in addition to rat genes, QTLs and strains, RGD houses mouse and human genes and QTLs and offers pertinent associated data, acquired through manual literature curation and imported via pipelines. A collection of controlled vocabularies and ontologies is employed for the standardized extraction and provision of biological data. The vocabularies/ontologies allow the capture of disease and phenotype associations of rat strains and QTLs, as well as disease and pathway associations of rat, human and mouse genes. A suite of tools enables the retrieval, manipulation, viewing and analysis of data. Genes associated with particular conditions or with altered networks underlying disease pathways can be retrieved. Genetic variants in humans or in sequenced rat strains can be searched and compared. Lists of rat strains and species-specific genes and QTLs can be generated for selected ontology terms and then analyzed, downloaded or sent to other tools. From many entry points, data can be accessed and results retrieved. To illustrate, diabetes is used as a case study to initiate and embark upon an exploratory journey.",nonCancer

The best method to identify such patients remains unclear. Clinical assessment of residual mucosal abnormality is considered the most accurate method. In our institution, magnetic resonance tumor regression grade is performed as routine to assess response.|The purpose of this study was to compare the sensitivity of magnetic tumor regression grade against residual mucosal abnormality in detecting patients with a pathological complete response.|Magnetic tumor regression grade scores from reported posttreatment MRI scans were documented. Magnetic tumor regression grade 1 to 3 was defined as likely to predict complete or near complete response. Gross appearances of the mucosa were derived from histopathology reports and used as a surrogate for clinical assessment (previously validated). Final histopathological staging was used to determine response.|The study was conducted at Royal Marsden National Health Service Trust, United Kingdom.|A total of 143 patients with rectal adenocarcinoma, diagnosed between September 1, 2009, and September 1, 2013, who received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy before curative surgery were included.|The sensitivity of magnetic tumor regression grade and residual mucosal abnormality in detecting patients with pathological complete response were measured RESULTS:: Eighteen patients had a pathological complete response. Seventeen were detected using magnetic resonance tumor regression grade 1 to 3, with sensitivity 94% (95% CI, 0.74-0.99), and 10 were detected using residual mucosal abnormality, with sensitivity 62% (95% CI, 0.38-0.81). There was no statistical difference between the false positive rates for either method. Magnetic tumor regression grade identified 10 times more patients with a pathological complete response (diagnostic OR = 10.2 (95% CI, 1.30-73.73)) compared with clinical assessment with RMA.|Residual mucosal abnormality was used as a surrogate marker for endoscopic appearances.|Most patients with rectal cancer who have a pathological complete response do not manifest a complete response at the mucosal level.

We examined the antitumor action of the MET-TKI crizotinib (PF-02341066) in lung cancer cells that are positive or negative for MET amplification or mutation. The antitumor action of crizotinib was evaluated on the basis of signal transduction, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and progression of tumor xenografts. Inhibition of MET signaling by crizotinib or by RNA interference-mediated MET depletion resulted in the induction of apoptosis accompanied by inhibition of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation in lung cancer cells with MET amplification but not in cells with a MET mutation or in those without amplification or mutation of MET. These results suggest that MET signaling is essential for the survival of cells with MET amplification but not for that of cells without this genetic change, including those with a MET mutation. Crizotinib up-regulated the expression of BIM, a proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family, and down-regulated that of survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, in cells with MET amplification. Forced depletion of BIM and expression of survivin each inhibited crizotinib-induced apoptosis, suggesting that both up-regulation of BIM and down-regulation of survivin contribute to the proapoptotic effect of crizotinib. Crizotinib shows a marked antitumor action in MET amplification-positive lung cancer cells but not in cells without MET amplification, including those with a MET mutation.",cancer
742,Somatic mutations in exocrine pancreatic tumors: association with patient survival.,"KRAS mutations are major factors involved in initiation and maintenance of pancreatic tumors. The impact of different mutations on patient survival has not been clearly defined. We screened tumors from 171 pancreatic cancer patients for mutations in KRAS and CDKN2A genes. Mutations in KRAS were detected in 134 tumors, with 131 in codon 12 and only 3 in codon 61. The GGT>GAT (G12D) was the most frequent mutation and was present in 60% (80/134). Deletions and mutations in CDKN2A were detected in 43 tumors. Analysis showed that KRAS mutations were associated with reduced patient survival in both malignant exocrine and ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). Patients with PDACs that had KRAS mutations showed a median survival of 17 months compared to 30 months for those without mutations (log-rank P = 0.07) with a multivariate hazard ratio (HR) of 2.19 (95%CI 1.09-4.42). The patients with G12D mutation showed a median survival of 16 months (log-rank-test P = 0.03) and an associated multivariate HR 2.42 (95%CI 1.14-2.67). Although, the association of survival in PDAC patients with CDKN2A aberrations in tumors was not statistically significant, the sub-group of patients with concomitant KRAS mutations and CDKN2A alterations in tumors were associated with a median survival of 13.5 months compared to 22 months without mutation (log-rank-test P = 0.02) and a corresponding HR of 3.07 (95%CI 1.33-7.10). Our results are indicative of an association between mutational status and survival in PDAC patients, which if confirmed in subsequent studies can have potential clinical application.",cancer
1780,N-heterocyclic Carbene Catalytic [4+2] Cyclization of 3-Alkylenyloxindoles with Enals: a Gamma-Carbon Activation for Enantioselective Assembly of Spirocarbocyclic Oxindoles.,"The ubiquitous structure of all-carbospirocyclic oxindoles makes the development of new methods for their enantioselective and stereoselective synthesis a significant ongoing challenge. Herein, we disclose a formal [4+2] annulation through N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalysis for highly enantioselective synthesis of intriguing spirocarbocyclic oxindoles in the presence of Lewis acids. This protocol features good substrates tolerance, good yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 97% ee) under mild conditions.",nonCancer
1426,Cyclotriveratrylene-Containing Porphyrins.,"The C3-symmetric cyclotriveratrylene (CTV) was covalently bonded via click chemistry to 1, 2, 3, and 6 zinc(II) porphyrin units to various host for C60. The binding constants, Ka, were measured from the quenching of the porphyrin fluorescence by C60. These constants vary between 400 and 4000 M(-1) and are considered weak. Computer modeling demonstrated that the zinc(II) porphyrin units, [Zn], exhibit a strong tendency to occupy the CTV cavity, hence blocking the access for C60 to land on this site. Instead, the pincer of the type [Zn]----[Zn] and in one case [Zn]----CTV, were found to be the most probable geometry to promote host-guest associations in these systems.",nonCancer
1702,Rhamnose Links Moonlighting Proteins to Membrane Phospholipid in Mycoplasmas.,"Many proteins that have a primary function as a cytoplasmic protein are known to have the ability to moonlight on the surface of nearly all organisms. An example is the glycolytic enzyme enolase, which can be found on the surface of many types of cells from bacteria to human. Surface enolase is not enzymatic because it is monomeric and oligomerization is required for glycolytic activity. It can bind various molecules and activate plasminogen. Enolase lacks a signal peptide and the mechanism by which it attaches to the surface is unknown. We found that treatment of whole cells of the murine pathogen Mycoplasma pulmonis with phospholipase D released enolase and other common moonlighting proteins. Glycostaining suggested that the released proteins were glycosylated. Cytoplasmic and membrane-bound enolase was isolated by immunoprecipitation. No post-translational modification was detected on cytoplasmic enolase, but membrane enolase was associated with lipid, phosphate and rhamnose. Treatment with phospholipase released the lipid and phosphate from enolase but not the rhamnose. The site of rhamnosylation was identified as a glutamine residue near the C-terminus of the protein. Rhamnose has been found in all species of mycoplasma examined but its function was previously unknown. Mycoplasmas are small bacteria with have no peptidoglycan, and rhamnose in these organisms is also not associated with polysaccharide. We suggest that rhamnose has a central role in anchoring proteins to the membrane by linkage to phospholipid, which may be a general mechanism for the membrane association of moonlighting proteins in mycoplasmas and perhaps other bacteria.",nonCancer
286,Upregulation of the antiapoptotic factor Livin contributes to cisplatin resistance in colon cancer cells.,"The antiapoptotic factor Livin has been considered critical for tumor progression and poor prognosis for variant types of tumors. However, there are only limited reports regarding its expression and biological functions in colon cancer. Here, we examined Livin expression in four colon cancer cell lines (HCT116, RKO, KM12C, and SW620) in the presence or absence of cisplatin that was used as a model reagent. We found the different response to cisplatin was related to endogenous Livin expression level. From among a panel of apoptosis-related factors (p53, Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, BAX, and survivin), the expression of Livin was upregulated after cisplatin treatment in a dose-dependent manner. Both immunocytochemistry and nuclear cytoplasmic fractionation indicated Livin remained in the cytoplasm after treatment with cisplatin. In an attempt to explore the mechanism, we found the elevated expression of Livin was not due to the decreased degradation by proteosome but was enhanced at the mRNA level. Besides, cisplatin treatment activated the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway as shown by increased phosphorylation of Akt1, mTOR, S6K, and 4E-BP1, together with the elevated Livin. The PI3K inhibitor LY294002 inhibited both the phosphorylation of mTOR and upregulation of Livin. The stable overexpression of Livin inhibited the activation of caspase-3 and led to resistance to cisplatin, while the knockdown of Livin by siRNA rendered colon cancer cells more sensitive to cisplatin. Our study, along with others, highlighted the potential of Livin for cancer therapy in colon cancer.",cancer
2292,The health care and life sciences community profile for dataset descriptions.,"Access to consistent, high-quality metadata is critical to finding, understanding, and reusing scientific data. However, while there are many relevant vocabularies for the annotation of a dataset, none sufficiently captures all the necessary metadata. This prevents uniform indexing and querying of dataset repositories. Towards providing a practical guide for producing a high quality description of biomedical datasets, the W3C Semantic Web for Health Care and the Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLSIG) identified Resource Description Framework (RDF) vocabularies that could be used to specify common metadata elements and their value sets. The resulting guideline covers elements of description, identification, attribution, versioning, provenance, and content summarization. This guideline reuses existing vocabularies, and is intended to meet key functional requirements including indexing, discovery, exchange, query, and retrieval of datasets, thereby enabling the publication of FAIR data. The resulting metadata profile is generic and could be used by other domains with an interest in providing machine readable descriptions of versioned datasets.",nonCancer
1633,Risk-adjusted outcomes in Medicare inpatient nephrectomy patients.,"Without risk-adjusted outcomes of surgical care across both the inpatient and postacute period of time, hospitals and surgeons cannot evaluate the effectiveness of current performance in nephrectomy and other operations, and will not have objective metrics to gauge improvements from care redesign efforts.We compared risk-adjusted hospital outcomes following elective total and partial nephrectomy to demonstrate differences that can be used to improve care. We used the Medicare Limited Dataset for 2010 to 2012 for total and partial nephrectomy for benign and malignant neoplasms to create prediction models for the adverse outcomes (AOs) of inpatient deaths, prolonged length-of-stay outliers, 90-day postdischarge deaths without readmission, and 90-day relevant readmissions. From the 4 prediction models, total predicted adverse outcomes were determined for each hospital in the dataset that met a minimum of 25 evaluable cases for the study period. Standard deviations (SDs) for each hospital were used to identify specific z-scores. Risk-adjusted adverse outcomes rates were computed to permit benchmarking each hospital's performance against the national standard. Differences between best and suboptimal performing hospitals defined the potential margin of preventable adverse outcomes for this operation.A total of 449 hospitals with 23,477 patients were evaluated. Overall AO rate was 20.8%; 17 hospitals had risk-adjusted AO rates that were 2 SDs poorer than predicted and 8 were 2 SDs better. The top performing decile of hospitals had a risk-adjusted AO rate of 10.2% while the lowest performing decile had 32.1%. With a minimum of 25 cases for each study hospital, no statistically valid improvement in outcomes was seen with increased case volume.Inpatient and 90-day postdischarge risk-adjusted adverse outcomes demonstrated marked variability among study hospitals and illustrate the opportunities for care improvement. This analytic design is applicable for comparing provider performance across a wide array of different inpatient episodes.",nonCancer

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the applicability of an innovative RSA set-up for in vivo knee kinematic analysis, using a biplane fluoroscopic image system. To this end, the Authors describe the set-up as well as a possible protocol for clinical knee joint evaluation. The accuracy of the kinematic measurements is assessed.|the Authors evaluated the accuracy of 3D kinematic analysis of the knee in a new RSA set-up, based on a commercial biplane fluoroscopy system integrated into the clinical environment. The study was organized in three main phases: an in vitro test under static conditions, an in vitro test under dynamic conditions reproducing a flexion-extension range of motion (ROM), and an in vivo analysis of the flexion-extension ROM. For each test, the following were calculated, as an indication of the tracking accuracy: mean, minimum, maximum values and standard deviation of the error of rigid body fitting.|in terms of rigid body fitting, in vivo test errors were found to be 0.10±0.05 mm. Phantom tests in static and kinematic conditions showed precision levels, for translations and rotations, of below 0.1 mm/0.2° and below 0.5 mm/0.3° respectively for all directions.|the results of this study suggest that kinematic RSA can be successfully performed using a standard clinical biplane fluoroscopy system for the acquisition of slow movements of the lower limb.|a kinematic RSA set-up using a clinical biplane fluoroscopy system is potentially applicable and provides a useful method for obtaining better characterization of joint biomechanics.",nonCancer
2093,Discovery of Key Dioxygenases that Diverged the Paraher-quonin and Acetoxydehydroaustin Pathways in Penicillium brasilianum.,"Paraherquonin (1), a fungal meroterpenoid produced by Penicillium brasilianum NBRC 6234, possesses a unique, highly congested hexacyclic molecular architecture. Here we identified the biosynthetic gene cluster of 1 (the prh cluster) and elucidated the pathway up to berkeleydione (2), which serves as the key intermediate for the biosynthesis of 1 as well as many other meroterpenoids. Interestingly, the nonheme iron and α-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase PrhA constructs the cycloheptadiene moiety to afford 2 from preaustinoid A1 (6), probably via the homoallyl-homoallyl radical rearrangement. Additionally, another fungal strain, P. brasilianum MG11, which produces acetoxydehydroaustin instead of 1, was found to have a gene cluster nearly identical to the prh cluster. The dioxygenase encoded by the cluster shares 92% sequence identity with PrhA, and also accepts 6 but produces preaustinoid A3 (17) with a spiro-lactone system, generating a diverging point for the two different meroterpenoid pathways in the same species.",nonCancer
773,Expression of p16 and retinoblastoma determines response to CDK4/6 inhibition in ovarian cancer.,"PD-0332991 is a selective inhibitor of the CDK4/6 kinases with the ability to block retinoblastoma (Rb) phosphorylation in the low nanomolar range. Here we investigate the role of CDK4/6 inhibition in human ovarian cancer. We examined the effects of PD-0332991 on proliferation, cell-cycle, apoptosis, and Rb phosphorylation using a panel of 40 established human ovarian cancer cell lines. Molecular markers for response prediction, including p16 and Rb, were studied using gene expression profiling, Western blot, and array CGH. Multiple drug effect analysis was used to study interactions with chemotherapeutic drugs. Expression of p16 and Rb was studied using immunohistochemistry in a large clinical cohort of ovarian cancer patients. Concentration-dependent antiproliferative effects of PD-0332991 were seen in all ovarian cancer cell lines, but varied significantly between individual lines. Rb-proficient cell lines with low p16 expression were most responsive to CDK4/6 inhibition. Copy number variations of CDKN2A, RB, CCNE1, and CCND1 were associated with response to PD-0332991. CDK4/6 inhibition induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest, blocked Rb phosphorylation in a concentration-and time-dependent manner, and enhanced the effects of chemotherapy. Rb-proficiency with low p16 expression was seen in 97/262 (37%) of ovarian cancer patients and was independently associated with poor progression-free survival (adjusted relative risk 1.49, 95% CI 1.00-2.24, P = 0.052). PD-0332991 shows promising biologic activity in ovarian cancer cell lines. Assessment of Rb and p16 expression may help select patients most likely to benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition in ovarian cancer.",cancer
385,FGFR1 is an adverse outcome indicator for luminal A breast cancers.,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) has been suggested to be the candidate gene for 8p11-12 amplification in breast cancer and its therapeutic/ prognostic value is explored. Most previous studies focused on FGFR1 gene amplification, which may not necessarily lead to protein expression. Therefore, analysis of protein level may have more clinical relevance. We evaluated FGFR1 expression in a large cohort of breast cancer by immunohistochemistry, correlated with the tumor clinic-pathologic features, biomarkers expression, and patient's survival. FGFR1 expression was associated mainly with luminal cancers, particularly luminal B subtype (23.5%; p < 0.001), and it also showed adverse prognostic impact on luminal A cancers. FGFR1 expression was associated with higher pN (p = 0.023), pT (p = 0.003) stages, lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.010), p-cadherin (p = 0.028), synaptophysin (p = 0.009) and SOX2 expression (p = 0.034) in luminal A cancers. FGFR1 expressing luminal A cancers showed a similar outcome as luminal B cancers. Multivariate Cox regression analysis demonstrated FGFR1 positive luminal A cancers to be an independently poor prognosticator for disease free survival in luminal cancers (hazard ratio = 3.341, p = 0.008). Thus FGFR1 could be useful in identifying the aggressive cases amongst heterogeneous luminal A cancers. Given the relevance of FGFR pathway in treatment resistance in luminal cancers, FGFR1 could be an important tumor biomarker and adverse prognostic factor potentially exploitable in the clinical management of luminal cancers.",cancer
1978,A Randomized Controlled Study of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress in Street Children in Mexico City.,"The study aimed to evaluate cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for posttraumatic stress (PTS), depression, anxiety, and anger in street children by a randomized controlled trial of CBT versus a waitlist control. It was conducted in 8 residential facilities for street children in Mexico City, with assessments at baseline, posttreatment, and 3 months later. Children who reported at least moderate posttraumatic stress, and fulfilled the study requirement were enrolled in the study (N = 100, 12-18 years old, 36 boys). There were 51 children randomized to CBT and 49 to the waitlist condition. Randomization was stratified by gender. CBT consisted of 12 individual 1-hour sessions administered weekly by 2 trained, master's-level clinicians. Outcome measures included self-reports of PTS, depression, anxiety, and anger; global improvement was assessed by the independent evaluator. Compared to participants in the waitlist condition participants in CBT showed a significant reduction in all symptoms, with effects sizes of 1.73 to 1.75. At follow up there was attrition (n = 36), and no change from posttreatment scores. The study did find statistically significant improvement in symptoms in the CBT group compared to the waitlist condition; symptoms remained stable at 3 months. The study found that CBT for trauma in a sample of street children provided a reduction of a broad range of mental health symptoms.",nonCancer
40,Both BRAF V600E mutation and older age (≥ 65 years) are associated with recurrent papillary thyroid cancer.,"This study was designed to examine the aggressive features of BRAF-positive papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) and association with age. We compared the clinicopathologic parameters and BRAF V600E mutation status of 121 elderly (age ≥65 years) PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy from January 2007 to December 2009 to a consecutive cohort of 98 younger (age <65 years) PTC patients. Younger and elderly PTC patients had similar incidences of BRAF-positive tumors (41% vs. 38%; p = 0.67). The elderly cohort was more likely to have smaller tumors (mean 1.6 vs. 2.1 cm; p = 0.001), present with advanced TNM stage (36% vs. 19%; p = 0.008), and have persistent/recurrent disease (10% vs. 1%; p = 0.006). BRAF-positive status was associated with PTC that were tall cell variant (p < 0.001), had extrathyroidal extension (p < 0.001), lymph node involvement (p = 0.008), advanced (III/IV) TNM stage (p < 0.001), and disease recurrence (p < 0.001). Except for lymph node involvement, the association between aggressive histology characteristics at presentation and BRAF-positive PTC also was observed within the age-defined cohorts. In short-term follow-up (mean, 18 months), persistent/recurrent PTC was much more likely to occur in patients who were both BRAF-positive and elderly (22%). BRAF mutations are equally present in younger and older patients. Aggressive histology characteristics at presentation are associated with BRAF-positive PTC, irrespective of age. However, the well-established association of BRAF with recurrence is limited to older (age ≥65 years) patients.",cancer
2333,Critical Review of Noninvasive Optical Technologies for Wound Imaging.,"Significance: Noninvasive imaging approaches can provide greater information about a wound than visual inspection during the wound healing and treatment process. This review article focuses on various optical imaging techniques developed to image different wound types (more specifically ulcers). Recent Advances: The noninvasive optical imaging approaches in this review include hyperspectral imaging, multispectral imaging, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, optical coherence tomography, laser Doppler imaging, laser speckle imaging, spatial frequency domain imaging, and fluorescence imaging. The various wounds imaged using these techniques include open wounds, chronic wounds, diabetic foot ulcers, decubitus ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and burns. Preliminary work in the development and implementation of a near-infrared optical scanner for wound imaging as a noncontact hand-held device is briefly described. The technology is based on NIRS and has demonstrated its potential to differentiate a healing from nonhealing wound region. Critical Issues: While most of the optical imaging techniques can penetrate few hundred microns to a 1-2 mm from the wound surface, NIRS has the potential to penetrate deeper, demonstrating the potential to image internal wounds. Future Directions: All the technologies are currently at various stages of translational efforts to the clinic, with NIRS holding a greater promise for physiological assessment of the wounds internal, beyond the gold-standard visual assessment.",nonCancer
2346,Clinical significance and management of Barrett's esophagus with epithelial changes indefinite for dysplasia.,"Barrett's esophagus (BE) is defined as the extension of salmon-colored mucosa into the tubular esophagus ≥ 1 cm proximal to the gastroesophageal junction with biopsy confirmation of intestinal metaplasia. Patients with BE are at increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), and undergo endoscopic surveillance biopsies to detect dysplasia or early EAC. Dysplasia in BE is classified as no dysplasia, indefinite for dysplasia (IND), low grade dysplasia (LGD) or high grade dysplasia (HGD). Biopsies are diagnosed as IND when the epithelial abnormalities are not sufficient to diagnose dysplasia or the nature of the epithelial abnormalities is uncertain due to inflammation or technical issues. Specific diagnostic criteria for IND are not well established and its clinical significance and management has not been well studied. Previous studies have focused on HGD in BE and led to changes and improvement in the management of BE with HGD and early EAC. Only recently, IND and LGD in BE have become focus of intense study.

2207,"HIV-1 infection, microenvironment and endothelial cell dysfunction.","HIV-1 promotes a generalized immune activation that involves the main targets of HIV-1 infection but also cells that are not sensitive to viral infection. ECs display major dysfunctions in HIV+ patients during long-standing viral infection that persist even in the current cART era, in which new-generation drugs have reduced dysmetabolic side effects and successfully impeded viral replication. In vivo studies have failed to demonstrate the presence of replicating virus in ECs suggesting that a direct role of the virus is unlikely, and implying that the mechanism accounting for vascular dysfunction may rely on the indirect action of molecules released in the microenvironment by HIV-1-infected cells.

In particular, we discuss the emerging role played by different HIV-1 proteins in driving inflammation and EC dysregulation, and highlight the need to target them for therapeutic benefit.",nonCancer
2085,Glycolaldehyde-derived advanced glycation end products (glycol-AGEs)-induced vascular smooth muscle cell dysfunction is regulated by the AGES-receptor (RAGE) axis in endothelium.,"Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) are involved in the development of vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) dysfunction and the progression of atherosclerosis. However, AGEs may indirectly affect VSMCs via AGEs-induced signal transduction between monocytes and human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs), rather than having a direct influence. This study was designed to elucidate the signaling pathway underlying AGEs-RAGE axis influence on VSMC dysfunction using a co-culture system with monocytes, HUVECs and VSMCs. AGEs stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β via extracellular-signal-regulated kinases phosphorylation and nuclear factor-κB activation in HUVECs. It was observed that AGEs-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines increase VSMC proliferation, inflammation and vascular remodeling in the co-culture system. This result implies that RAGE plays a role in AGEs-induced VSMC dysfunction. We suggest that the regulation of signal transduction via the AGEs-RAGE axis in the endothelium can be a therapeutic target for preventing atherosclerosis.",nonCancer

We studied 126 well-characterized CLL patients by direct sequencing and DHPLC to detect TP53 mutations (exons 2-11). Most patients with 17p deletions also had TP53 mutations (81%). Mutations in the absence of 17p deletions were found in 4.5%. We found a shorter survival for patients with TP53 mutation (n = 18; P = .002), which was more pronounced when analyzed from the time point of mutation detection (6.8 vs 69 months, P < .001). The survival was equally poor for patients with deletion 17p plus TP53 mutation (7.6 months, n = 13), TP53 mutation only (5.5 months, n = 5), and 17p deletion only (5.4 months, n = 3). The prognostic impact of TP53 mutation (HR 3.71) was shown to be independent of stage, VH status, and 11q and 17p deletion in multivariate analysis. Serial samples showed evidence of clonal evolution and increasing clone size during chemotherapy, suggesting that there may be patients where this treatment is potentially harmful. TP53 mutations are associated with poor sur-vival once they occur in CLL. The de-monstration of clonal evolution under selective pressure supports the biologic significance of TP53 mutations in CLL.",cancer
1526,Unveil the Structural Basis that Regulates the Energy Transduction Properties within a Family of Triheme Cytochromes from Geobacter sulfurreducens.,"A family of triheme cytochromes from Geobacter sulfurreducens plays an important role in extracellular electron transfer. In addition to their role in electron transfer pathways, two members of this family (PpcA and PpcD) were also found to be able to couple e-/H+ transfer through the redox-Bohr effect observed in the physiological pH range, a feature not observed for cytochromes PpcB and PpcE. As part of understanding the molecular control of the redox-Bohr effect in this family of cytochromes, which is highly homologous both in amino acid sequence and structures, it was observed that residue 6 is a conserved leucine in PcpA and PpcD, whereas in the other two characterized members (PpcB and PpcE) the equivalent residue is a phenylalanine. To determine the role of this residue located close to the redox-Bohr center, we replaced Leu6 in PpcA with Phe and determined the redox properties of the mutant, as well as its solution structure in the fully reduced state. In contrast with the native, the mutant PpcAL6F is not able to couple e-/H+ pathway. We carried out the reverse mutation in PpcB and PpcE (i.e., replace Phe6 in these two proteins by leucine) and show that the mutant proteins showed an increased redox-Bohr effect. The results clearly establish the role of residue 6 in the control of the redox-Bohr effect in this family of cytochromes, a feature that can enable rational design of G. sulfurreducens strains carrying mutant cytochromes with optimal redox-Bohr effect as suitable for various biotechnological applications.",nonCancer

351,Oncogenic RIT1 mutations in lung adenocarcinoma.,"Lung adenocarcinoma is comprised of distinct mutational subtypes characterized by mutually exclusive oncogenic mutations in RTK/RAS pathway members KRAS, EGFR, BRAF and ERBB2, and translocations involving ALK, RET and ROS1. Identification of these oncogenic events has transformed the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma via application of therapies targeted toward specific genetic lesions in stratified patient populations. However, such mutations have been reported in only ∼55% of lung adenocarcinoma cases in the United States, suggesting other mechanisms of malignancy are involved in the remaining cases. Here we report somatic mutations in the small GTPase gene RIT1 in ∼2% of lung adenocarcinoma cases that cluster in a hotspot near the switch II domain of the protein. RIT1 switch II domain mutations are mutually exclusive with all other known lung adenocarcinoma driver mutations. Ectopic expression of mutated RIT1 induces cellular transformation in vitro and in vivo, which can be reversed by combined PI3K and MEK inhibition. These data identify RIT1 as a driver oncogene in a specific subset of lung adenocarcinomas and suggest PI3K and MEK inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy in RIT1-mutated tumors.",cancer

GnRH analog therapy can reduce testosterone to ""castrate"" levels, historically defined as <50 ng/dL. With the advent of newer assays, a lower threshold of <20 ng/dL has recently been proposed. We report the results of a retrospective analysis of two Phase III trials of 4- and 6-month depot microsphere formulations of leuprolide acetate (LA), a GnRH agonist that has previously demonstrated efficacy in testosterone suppression to <50 ng/dL in patients on ADT. This analysis investigates the ability of these LA formulations to suppress to ≤20 ng/dL levels.|In two of five AbbVie/Abbott clinical trials of microsphere formulations of LA for ADT, analytic technology permitting testosterone detection as low as 3 ng/dL was used and thus was selected for this analysis. Both trials were open-label, fixed-dose studies in prostate cancer patients, naïve to ADT. Patients received either 30 mg (4-month formulation; n=49) or 45 mg (6-month formulation; n=151) depot injections of LA microspheres. Treatment duration was up to 32 weeks for the 4-month formulation and 48 weeks for the 6-month formulation. The proportion of patients achieving the 20 ng/dL threshold was determined every 4 weeks.|Pooled analysis showed that 152 of 193 (79%) of patients achieved serum testosterone levels of ≤20 ng/dL at 4 weeks, and sustained the improvement at week 24 (169/189, 89%). Additionally, in the 6-month study, 127/135 (94.1%) patients were suppressed to ≤20 ng/dL at 48 weeks.|Both 4- and 6-month intramuscular depot formulations of LA achieved and maintained mean serum testosterone levels ≤20 ng/dL in the vast majority of patients as early as 4 weeks following treatment initiation. Additional research on the clinical relevance of this lower testosterone threshold is warranted.",nonCancer
2330,Is it safe to nest near conspicuous neighbours? Spatial patterns in predation risk associated with the density of American Golden-Plover nests.,"Predation is one of the main factors explaining nesting mortality in most bird species. Birds can avoid nest predation or reduce predation pressure by breeding at higher latitude, showing anti-predator behaviour, selecting nest sites protected from predators, and nesting in association with protective species. American Golden-Plovers (Pluvialis dominica) defend their territory by using various warning and distraction behaviours displayed at varying levels of intensity (hereafter ""conspicuous behaviour""), as well as more aggressive behaviours such as aerial attacks, but only in some populations. Such antipredator behaviour has the potential to repel predators and thus benefit the neighbouring nests by decreasing their predation risk. Yet, conspicuous behaviour could also attract predators by signalling the presence of a nest. To test for the existence of a protective effect associated with the conspicuous antipredator behaviour of American Golden-Plovers, we studied the influence of proximity to plover nests on predation risk of artificial nests on Igloolik Island (Nunavut, Canada) in July 2014. We predicted that the predation risk of artificial nests would decrease with proximity to and density of plover nests. We monitored 18 plover nests and set 35 artificial nests at 30, 50, 100, 200, and 500 m from seven of those plover nests. We found that the predation risk of artificial nests increases with the density of active plover nests. We also found a significant negative effect of the distance to the nearest active protector nest on predation risk of artificial nests. Understanding how the composition and structure of shorebird communities generate spatial patterns in predation risks represents a key step to better understand the importance of these species of conservation concern in tundra food webs.",nonCancer
355,Genome sequencing of SHH medulloblastoma predicts genotype-related response to smoothened inhibition.,"Smoothened (SMO) inhibitors recently entered clinical trials for sonic-hedgehog-driven medulloblastoma (SHH-MB). Clinical response is highly variable. To understand the mechanism(s) of primary resistance and identify pathways cooperating with aberrant SHH signaling, we sequenced and profiled a large cohort of SHH-MBs (n = 133). SHH pathway mutations involved PTCH1 (across all age groups), SUFU (infants, including germline), and SMO (adults). Children >3 years old harbored an excess of downstream MYCN and GLI2 amplifications and frequent TP53 mutations, often in the germline, all of which were rare in infants and adults. Functional assays in different SHH-MB xenograft models demonstrated that SHH-MBs harboring a PTCH1 mutation were responsive to SMO inhibition, whereas tumors harboring an SUFU mutation or MYCN amplification were primarily resistant.",cancer
1810,Ultrahigh Dimensional Variable Selection for Interpolation of Point Referenced Spatial Data: A Digital Soil Mapping Case Study.,"Modern soil mapping is characterised by the need to interpolate point referenced (geostatistical) observations and the availability of large numbers of environmental characteristics for consideration as covariates to aid this interpolation. Modelling tasks of this nature also occur in other fields such as biogeography and environmental science. This analysis employs the Least Angle Regression (LAR) algorithm for fitting Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) penalized Multiple Linear Regressions models. This analysis demonstrates the efficiency of the LAR algorithm at selecting covariates to aid the interpolation of geostatistical soil carbon observations. Where an exhaustive search of the models that could be constructed from 800 potential covariate terms and 60 observations would be prohibitively demanding, LASSO variable selection is accomplished with trivial computational investment.",nonCancer
2220,The Effect of Photodynamic Therapy and Diode Laser as Adjunctive Periodontal Therapy on the Inflammatory Mediators Levels in Gingival Crevicular Fluid and Clinical Periodontal Status.,"The presence of bacterial biofilms is the major cause of gingivitis and periodontitis, their mechanical removal is not often enough. Therefore, laser therapy and photodynamic therapy can be effective as adjunctive treatment.|This study aimed to evaluate the impact of these treatments on the level of gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), inflammatory mediators, and periodontal clinical status.|In this clinical trial, three quadrants were studied in 12 patients with chronic periodontitis aged 30-60 years. The clinical parameters were recorded and GCF samples were taken. After the first phase of periodontal treatment, one of the three quadrants was determined as the control group, one was treated by diode laser, and one underwent photodynamic therapy. The clinical parameters were recorded 2 and 6 weeks later. The data were statistically analyzed by using Friedman, ANOVA, and LSD post-test.|Significant reduction was observed over time in the level of Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-17 (IL-17), clinical attachment loss, and pocket depth in the three treatment groups (p< 0.000). The three treatment methods significantly reduced the IL-1β and IL-17 at the baseline, up to 2 weeks, and 2-6 weeks (p< 0.05). Diode laser and photodynamic therapy significantly decreased the average bleeding on probing over time (p< 0.000 and p< 0.002, respectively).|Laser and photodynamic therapy reduced the inflammatory mediators (IL-1β and IL-17) and improved the clinical symptoms.",nonCancer
80,Prognostic impact of WT1 mutations in cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia: a study of the German-Austrian AML Study Group.,"To evaluate the incidence and clinical impact of WT1 gene mutations in younger adult patients with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML), sequencing of the complete coding region was performed in diagnostic samples from 617 patients who were treated on 3 German-Austrian AML Study Group protocols. WT1 mutations were identified in 78 (12.6%) of the 617 patients; mutations clustered in exon 7 (54 of 78) and exon 9 (13 of 78), but also occurred in exons 1, 2, 3, and 8. WT1 mutations were significantly associated with younger age, higher serum lactate dehydrogenase levels, higher blood blast counts, and the additional presence of FLT3-ITD (P < .001) and CEBPA mutations (P = .004). There was no difference in relapse-free survival and overall survival between patients with (WT1(mut)) or without WT1 mutations. Subset analysis showed that patients with the genotype WT1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(pos) had a lower complete remission rate (P = .003) and an inferior relapse-free survival (P = .006) and overall survival (P < .001) compared with those with the genotype WT1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(neg). In conclusion, in our large cohort of younger adults with CN-AML, WT1 mutation as a single molecular marker did not impact on outcome. However, our data suggest a negative impact of the genotype WT1(mut)/FLT3-ITD(pos).",cancer
788,Predictive role of BRAF mutations in patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving cetuximab and panitumumab: a meta-analysis.,"Wild type RAS (RAS-wt) status is predictive of the activities of the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies cetuximab (C) and panitumumab (P). We examined the impact of C and P on progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and overall response rate (ORR) in advanced colorectal cancer (CRC) patients who have RAS-wt/BRAF-mutant (BRAF-mut) status. Randomised trials that compared C or P plus chemotherapy (or C or P monotherapy) with standard therapy or best supportive care (BSC) were included. We used published hazard ratios (HRs) if they were available, or we derived treatment estimates from other survival data. Pooled estimates of the treatment efficacy of anti-EGFR-based therapy with C or P for the RAS-wt/BRAF-mut subgroup were calculated with the random-effect inverse variance weighted method. All statistical tests were two-sided. Nine phase III trials and one phase II trial (six first-line and two second-line trials, plus two trials involving chemorefractory patients), that included 463 RAS-wt/BRAF-mut CRC patients, were analysed. Overall, the addition of C or P treatment in the BRAF-mut subgroup did not significantly improve PFS (HR, 0.88; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.67-1.14; p=0.33), OS (HR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.62-1.34; p=0.63) and ORR (relative risk, 1.31; 95% CI 0.83-2.08, p=0.25) compared with control regimens. C- or P-based therapy did not increase the benefit of standard therapy or the BSC in RAS-wt/BRAF-mut CRC patients. These findings support BRAF mutation assessment before initiation of treatment with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies.",cancer
10,Molecular correlates of imatinib resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) commonly harbor oncogenic mutations of the KIT or platelet-derived growth factor alpha (PDGFRA) kinases, which are targets for imatinib. In clinical studies, 75% to 90% of patients with advanced GISTs experience clinical benefit from imatinib. However, imatinib resistance is an increasing clinical problem. One hundred forty-seven patients with advanced, unresectable GISTs were enrolled onto a randomized, phase II clinical study of imatinib. Specimens from pretreatment and/or imatinib-resistant tumors were analyzed to identify molecular correlates of imatinib resistance. Secondary kinase mutations of KIT or PDGFRA that were identified in imatinib-resistant GISTs were biochemically profiled for imatinib sensitivity. Molecular studies were performed using specimens from 10 patients with primary and 33 patients with secondary resistance. Imatinib-resistant tumors had levels of activated KIT that were similar to or greater than those typically found in untreated GISTs. Secondary kinase mutations were rare in GISTs with primary resistance but frequently found in GISTs with secondary resistance (10% v 67%; P = .002). Evidence for clonal evolution and/or polyclonal secondary kinase mutations was seen in three (18.8%) of 16 patients. Secondary kinase mutations were nonrandomly distributed and were associated with decreased imatinib sensitivity compared with typical KIT exon 11 mutations. Using RNAi technology, we demonstrated that imatinib-resistant GIST cells remain dependent on KIT kinase activity for activation of critical downstream signaling pathways. Different molecular mechanisms are responsible for primary and secondary imatinib resistance in GISTs. These findings have implications for future approaches to the growing problem of imatinib resistance in patients with advanced GISTs.",cancer
61,"The impact of FLT3 internal tandem duplication mutant level, number, size, and interaction with NPM1 mutations in a large cohort of young adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia.","An internal tandem duplication in the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene (FLT3/ITD) is associated with poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), but the impact of mutant level, size, and interaction with nucleophosmin 1 (NPM1) mutations remains controversial. We evaluated these characteristics in a large cohort of young adult AML patients. There was a highly significant trend for worsening in relapse risk (RR) and overall survival (OS) with increasing FLT3/ITD mutant level (P < .001 for both), and even in the low level mutant group (1%-24% of total FLT3 alleles), RR was significantly worse than in the FLT3 wild-type (WT) group (P < .001). In multivariate analysis, mutant level was the most powerful prognostic factor for RR. Mutant size and number had no significant impact on outcome. The beneficial impact of an NPM1 mutation on RR and OS was seen in FLT3/ITD(+) as well as FLT3/WT patients; both markers were highly significant independent predictors of outcome (P < .001). Stratification using both markers identified 3 prognostic groups: good (FLT3/ITD(-)NPM1(+)), intermediate (FLT3/ITD(-)NPM1(-) or FLT3/ITD(+)NPM1(+)), and poor (FLT3/ITD(+)NPM1(-)). Patients with high FLT3/ITD mutant level (greater than 50%) or FLT3/ITD(+) in the absence of an NPM1 mutation may be good candidates for more experimental therapeutic approaches.",cancer
838,"Targeting activated Akt with GDC-0068, a novel selective Akt inhibitor that is efficacious in multiple tumor models.","We describe the preclinical pharmacology and antitumor activity of GDC-0068, a novel highly selective ATP-competitive pan-Akt inhibitor currently in clinical trials for the treatment of human cancers. The effect of GDC-0068 on Akt signaling was characterized using specific biomarkers of the Akt pathway, and response to GDC-0068 was evaluated in human cancer cell lines and xenograft models with various genetic backgrounds, either as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapeutic agents. GDC-0068 blocked Akt signaling both in cultured human cancer cell lines and in tumor xenograft models as evidenced by dose-dependent decrease in phosphorylation of downstream targets. Inhibition of Akt activity by GDC-0068 resulted in blockade of cell-cycle progression and reduced viability of cancer cell lines. Markers of Akt activation, including high-basal phospho-Akt levels, PTEN loss, and PIK3CA kinase domain mutations, correlate with sensitivity to GDC-0068. Isogenic PTEN knockout also sensitized MCF10A cells to GDC-0068. In multiple tumor xenograft models, oral administration of GDC-0068 resulted in antitumor activity ranging from tumor growth delay to regression. Consistent with the role of Akt in a survival pathway, GDC-0068 also enhanced antitumor activity of classic chemotherapeutic agents. GDC-0068 is a highly selective, orally bioavailable Akt kinase inhibitor that shows pharmacodynamic inhibition of Akt signaling and robust antitumor activity in human cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. Our preclinical data provide a strong mechanistic rationale to evaluate GDC-0068 in cancers with activated Akt signaling.",cancer
635,Phase II study of the oral MEK inhibitor selumetinib in advanced acute myelogenous leukemia: a University of Chicago phase II consortium trial.,"The clinical relevance of targeting the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway, activated in 70% to 80% of patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), is unknown. Selumetinib is an oral small-molecule inhibitor of MAP-ERK kinase (MEK)-1/2. Forty-seven patients with relapsed/refractory AML or 60 years old or more with untreated AML were enrolled on a phase II study. Patients were stratified by FLT3 ITD mutation status. The primary endpoint was response rate (complete, partial, and minor). Leukemia cells were analyzed for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mTOR phosphorylation. Common drug-related toxicities were grade 1-2 diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and skin rash. In the FLT3 wild-type cohort, six of 36 (17%) patients had a response [one partial response, three minor responses, two unconfirmed minor responses (uMR)]. No patient with FLT3 ITD responded. NRAS and KRAS mutations were detected in 7% and 2% of patients, respectively. The sole patient with KRAS mutation had uMR with hematologic improvement in platelets. Baseline p-ERK activation was observed in 85% of patients analyzed but did not correlate with a response. A single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs3733542 in exon 18 of the KIT gene was detected in significantly higher number of patients with response/stable disease compared with nonresponders (60% vs. 23%; P = 0.027). Selumetinib is associated with modest single-agent antileukemic activity in advanced AML. However, given its favorable toxicity profile, combination with drugs that target other signaling pathways in AML should be considered. The potential association of SNP rs3733542 in exon 18 of the KIT gene with antileukemic activity of selumetinib is intriguing, but will require validation in larger trials.",cancer
1227,Mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene in colorectal cancer in Taiwan.,"Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 have been reported as occurring prevalently in a wide range of human tumors. Detection of a mutated p53 is thought to provide useful information for the clinical management of colorectal neoplasm. In this study, we used polymerase chain reaction/single-strand conformation polymorphism (PCR/SSCP) and sequencing analysis to rapidly screen for mutations in p53 in colorectal cancer in Taiwan. Genomic DNA was purified from colorectal cancer specimens obtained from 80 patients at a teaching hospital in southern Taiwan. Primer sets were designed to amplify fragments within exons 4-8 of p53. We found p53 mutations in 38 of 80 patients. This is the first identification of a mutation at codon 143 of p53 in colorectal cancer in Taiwan. In addition, we found two insertions in exon 5 of p53. The p53 mutation rate among colorectal tumors in Taiwan, found in this study, is 43%. The results indicate that p53 mutation is not significantly associated with tumor grade, age, or gender (p > 0.05). We found that two-fifths of colorectal cancer patients in Taiwan have a p53 mutation, which could be used as a marker of colorectal cancer.",cancer

1003,Ligand-dependent platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR)-alpha activation sensitizes rare lung cancer and sarcoma cells to PDGFR kinase inhibitors.,"Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors (PDGFR) and their ligands play critical roles in several human malignancies. Sunitinib is a clinically approved multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor, c-KIT, and PDGFR, and has shown clinical activity in various solid tumors. Activation of PDGFR signaling has been described in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (PDGFRA mutations) as well as in chronic myeloid leukemia (BCR-PDGFRA translocation), and sunitinib can yield clinical benefit in both settings. However, the discovery of PDGFR activating mutations or gene rearrangements in other tumor types could reveal additional patient populations who might benefit from treatment with anti-PDGFR therapies, such as sunitinib. Using a high-throughput cancer cell line screening platform, we found that only 2 of 637 tested human tumor-derived cell lines show significant sensitivity to single-agent sunitinib exposure. These two cell lines [a non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and a rhabdomyosarcoma] showed expression of highly phosphorylated PDGFRA. In the sunitinib-sensitive adenosquamous NSCLC cell line, PDGFRA expression was associated with focal PFGRA gene amplification, which was similarly detected in a small fraction of squamous cell NSCLC primary tumor specimens. Moreover, in this NSCLC cell line, focal amplification of the gene encoding the PDGFR ligand PDGFC was also detected, and silencing PDGFRA or PDGFC expression by RNA interference inhibited proliferation. A similar codependency on PDGFRA and PDGFC was observed in the sunitinib-sensitive rhabdomyosarcoma cell line. These findings suggest that, in addition to gastrointestinal stromal tumors, rare tumors that show PDGFC-mediated PDGFRA activation may also be clinically responsive to pharmacologic PDGFRA or PDGFC inhibition.",cancer

Nevertheless, data on NAFLD in HIV mono-infection are scarce.|We prospectively investigated prevalence and predictors of NAFLD and liver fibrosis by transient elastography (TE) and associated controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in unselected HIV-infected adults without significant alcohol intake or viral hepatitis coinfection. NAFLD was defined as CAP≥238 dB/m. Significant liver fibrosis and cirrhosis were defined as TE measurement ≥7.1 and ≥13 kPa, respectively. Predictors of NAFLD and significant liver fibrosis were determined using logistic regression analysis.|300 consecutive patients (mean age 50 years, 77% men; mean CD4 570 cells/mm, 90% on antiretrovirals) were included as a part of a routine screening program. TE with CAP identified NAFLD and significant liver fibrosis in 48% and 15% of cases, respectively. NAFLD was independently associated with BMI >25 Kg/m (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 4.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.55-9.26) and elevated ALT (aOR 3.17, 95% CI 1.43-7.03). Independent predictors of significant liver fibrosis were diabetes (aOR 5.84, 95% CI 1.91-17.85), elevated ALT (aOR 3.30, 95% CI 1.27-8.59) and current use of protease inhibitors (aOR 3.96, 95% CI 1.64-9.54).|NAFLD and significant liver fibrosis diagnosed by TE with CAP are major comorbidities in unselected HIV mono-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy, particularly if metabolic conditions and elevated ALT coexist.

1962,Glutamine metabolism drives succinate accumulation in plasma and the lung during hemorrhagic shock.,"Metabolomic investigations have consistently reported succinate accumulation in plasma after critical injury. Succinate receptors have been identified on numerous tissues, and succinate has been directly implicated in post-ischemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, platelet activation and the generation of reactive oxygen species, which may potentiate morbidity and mortality risk to patients. Metabolic flux (heavy isotope labeling) studies demonstrate that glycolysis is not the primary source of increased plasma succinate during protracted shock. Glutamine is an alternative parent substrate for ATP generation during anaerobic conditions; a biochemical mechanism that ultimately supports cellular survival but produces succinate as a catabolite. We hypothesize that succinate accumulation during hemorrhagic shock is driven by glutaminolysis.|Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to hemorrhagic shock for 45 min (Shock, n=8), and compared to normotensive shams (Sham, n=8). At 15 min, animals received intravenous injection of 13C515N2-glutamine solution (iLG). Blood, brain, heart, lung and liver tissues were harvested at defined time points. Labeling distribution in samples was determined by ultra high pressure liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) metabolomic analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA with Tukey comparison determined significance of relative fold-change in metabolite level from baseline.|Hemorrhagic shock instigated succinate accumulation in plasma and lungs tissues (8.5 vs. 1.1 fold increase plasma succinate level from baseline, Shock vs. Sham, p=0.001; 3.2 fold higher succinate level in lung tissue, Shock vs. Sham, p=0.006). Metabolomic analysis identified labeled glutamine and labeled succinate in plasma (p=0.002) and lung tissue (p=0.013), confirming glutamine as the parent substrate.

600,Association studies of Fcγ receptor polymorphisms with outcome in HER2+ breast cancer patients treated with trastuzumab in NCCTG (Alliance) Trial N9831.,"Patients with HER2+ breast cancer treated with trastuzumab and chemotherapy have superior survival compared with patients treated with chemotherapy alone. Polymorphisms within FCGR2A and FCGR3A are associated with binding affinity of natural killer cells to the IgG1 portion of trastuzumab, and a polymorphism in FCGR2B (I232T) is associated with impaired regulatory activity. The association of these polymorphisms with clinical response among trastuzumab-treated patients is equivocal, with both positive and negative associations. We performed genotyping analysis on the FCGR3A V158F, FCGR2A R131H, and FCGR2B I232T polymorphisms in 1,325 patients from the N9831 clinical trial. Patients in arm A (N = 419) received chemotherapy only. Patients in arms B (N = 469) and C (N = 437) were treated with chemotherapy and trastuzumab (sequentially in arm B and concurrently in arm C). Using log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models, we compared disease-free survival (DFS) among genotypic groups within pooled arms B/C. We found no differences in DFS between trastuzumab-treated patients who had the FCGR3A 158 V/V and/or FCGR2A 131 H/H high-affinity genotypes and patients without those genotypes. Furthermore, there was no significant interaction between FCGR3A and FCGR2A and treatment. However, there was a difference in DFS for FCGR2B I232T, with I/I patients deriving benefit from trastuzumab (P < 0.001), compared with the T carriers who did not (P = 0.81). The interaction between FCGR2B genotype and treatment was statistically significant (P = 0.03). Our analysis did not reveal an association between FcγR high-affinity genotypes and outcomes. However, it seems that the FCGR2B inhibitory gene may be predictive of adjuvant trastuzumab benefit.",cancer
1177,EGFR-independent mechanisms of acquired resistance to AZD9291 in EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC patients.,"AZD9291 is an oral, irreversible, mutant-selective epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI), which specifically targets both sensitizing and resistant T790M mutations. This compound has shown outstanding activity, in a phase I/II (AURA) trial. However, despite impressive tumor responses in T790M-positive patients, acquired resistance to this drug limits the benefit of this compound. Mutations at the EGFR C797 codon, located within the kinase-binding site, were very recently reported to be a potential mechanism of resistance to AZD9291 in T790M-positive patients. To identify potential mechanisms of resistance to AZD9291, we report here on two patients with resistant biopsy specimens that had been treated with AZD9291. We identified in two distinct cases, HER2 and MET amplification by FISH and CGH as a potential mechanism of acquired resistance to third-generation EGFR-TKI. Interestingly, this event occurred with complete loss of the T790M mutation. In one case, we observed a different molecular status at two biopsy sites (the T790M mutation at the primary site and wild-type T790M at the metastatic site with different pathways of acquired resistance to AZD9291). Our observations suggest that T790M-positive and wild-type T790M clones may coexist at baseline. AZD9291 efficiently suppresses the growth of T790M-positive cells, but a population of wild-type T790M cells at baseline will mediate the development of resistance, here via a by-pass pathway activating either HER2 or MET.",cancer

The aims of this study were to identify patient- and health service-related predictors of poorly coordinated care and to explore patient preferences to assist care coordination.|Patients with incident colorectal cancer, identified from a state-wide cancer registry, completed a self-report questionnaire 6 to 8 months after their diagnosis. Care coordination was assessed with the Cancer Care Coordination Questionnaire for Patients. Multiple linear regression models were used to predict factors associated with a poor experience with cancer care coordination.|Among 560 patients (56% response rate), care coordination experiences were normally distributed (mean score, 76.1; standard deviation, 10.9). Patients who had 3 or more comorbid conditions (β, -4.56; standard error [SE], 1.46; P = .006), little or no understanding of the health system (β, -4.34; SE, 0.94; P < .001), and no regular general practitioner (GP; β, -4.09; SE, 2.07; P = .049) experienced poorer care coordination. At the health service level, patients who did not receive a written pretreatment plan (β, -4.15; SE, 0.95; P < .001) or did not see a cancer care coordinator (β, -3.29; SE, 1.03; P = .001) had lower scores. The most preferred resources included information packs (92%), written care plans (88%), and improved access to their own personal medical records (electronic, 86; paper, 84%), with most patients preferring a shared GP and surgeon care model.|There was wide variation in experiences across the state. The factors associated with lower scores provide a focus for targeted strategies for improving patients' experience with colorectal cancer care coordination.

1149,PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss correlate with similar prognostic factors and are not mutually exclusive in breast cancer.,"The phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/Akt pathway is frequently altered in breast cancer. PTEN, a phosphatase that opposes the effect of phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, can be mutated or lost, whereas the PIK3CA gene is mutated. These have been proposed as alternative mechanisms, and their clinicalpathology significance is under discussion. In this study, we aimed to explore whether PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss are mutually exclusive mechanisms, correlate with other known clinicopathologic markers, or have clinical implication in breast cancer. Exons 9 and 20 of the PIK3CA gene were analyzed in 270 breast tumors, and mutations were detected by single-stranded conformational analysis followed by sequencing. The expression of PTEN was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 201 tumors. PIK3CA mutations were found in 24% of the tumors and associated with estrogen receptor(+) status, small size, negative HER2 status, high Akt1, and high cyclin D1 protein expression. PTEN was negative in 37% of the cases and PTEN loss was associated with PIK3CA mutations (P = 0.0024). Tumors presenting PTEN loss or both alterations were often estrogen receptor(+), small in size, and HER2(-). PIK3CA mutations predicted for longer local recurrence-free survival. Moreover, PTEN loss by itself or combined with mutated PIK3CA tended to confer radiosensitivity. In addition, the patients with high S-phase fraction had longer recurrence-free survival if they carried mutations in the PIK3CA gene and/or had lost PTEN, whereas the same alterations were associated with shorter recurrence-free survival among patients with low S-phase fraction. PIK3CA mutations and PTEN loss were not mutually exclusive events and associated with similar prognostic factors.",cancer
1710,Transient remission of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease decreases the risk of incident type 2 diabetes mellitus in Japanese men.,"It is unclear how the transient remission of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects incident type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Here, we sought to determine the effect of the transient remission of NAFLD on incident T2DM in Japanese men.|We used a population-based health check-up program. The primary outcome was set as incident T2DM. We divided the participants who showed NAFLD at the time of enrollment into three groups according to their clinical course of NAFLD: the Regression group, in which the participants showed a regression of NAFLD and no relapse during the follow-up period; the Transient Remission group, in which participants achieved a transient remission of NAFLD, but had a relapse of NAFLD; and the Persistent group, in which participants showed NAFLD throughout the follow-up. The Never group of participants who did not show NAFLD throughout the follow-up served as a reference.|The incidence rates of T2DM in the Never group, the Regression group, the Transient Remission group, and the Persistent group were 4.7% (62/1306), 9.2% (14/153), 18.0% (25/139), and 35.1% (120/342), respectively. In a multivariate Cox regression analysis with covariates, the adjusted hazard ratios for incident T2DM compared with the Never group were as follows: Regression group: 1.08 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-2.04, P=0.81], Transient Remission group: 2.12 (95% CI 1.22-3.57, P<0.01), and Persistent group: 3.44 (95% CI 2.29-5.21, P<0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio of the Transient Remission group was significantly lower than that of the Persistent group (P<0.05).|Transient remission of NAFLD significantly decreased the risk of developing T2DM.",nonCancer
347,Low EGFR/MET ratio is associated with resistance to EGFR inhibitors in non-small cell lung cancer.,"Although activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are predictive markers for response to EGFR inhibitors, 30-40% of EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients are de novo non-responders. Hence, we sought to explore additional biomarkers of response. We conducted a prospective pilot study to characterize the expression and/or activation of key receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in stage IIIB-IV NSCLC tumors. A total of 37 patients were enrolled and 34 underwent EGFR inhibitor treatment. As expected, patients bearing activating EGFR mutations showed increased progression free survival (PFS) compared to patients with wild-type EGFR status (9.3 vs 1.4 months, p = 0.0629). Analysis of baseline tumor RTK profiles revealed that, regardless of EGFR mutation status, higher levels of EGFR relative to MET correlated with longer PFS. At multiple EGFR/MET ratio cut-offs, including 1, 2 and 3, median PFS according to below vs. above cut-offs were 0.4 vs. 6.1 (p = 0.0001), 0.5 vs. 9.3 (p = 0.0006) and 1.0 vs. 11.2 months (p = 0.0008), respectively. The EGFR/MET ratio measured in tumors at baseline may help identify NSCLC patients most likely to benefit from prolonged PFS when treated with EGFR inhibitors.",cancer
1005,"Identification of Ponatinib as a potent inhibitor of growth, migration, and activation of neoplastic eosinophils carrying FIP1L1-PDGFRA.","In chronic eosinophilic leukemia, the transforming oncoprotein FIP1L1-PDGFRA is a major target of therapy. In most patients, the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) imatinib induces complete remission. For patients who are intolerant or resistant, novel TKIs have been proposed. We examined the in vitro effects of 14 kinase blockers on growth and function of EOL-1 cells, a FIP1L1-PDGFRA(+) eosinophil cell line. Major growth-inhibitory effects were seen with all PDGFR-blocking agents, with IC50 values in the low nanomolar range: ponatinib, 0.1-0.2 nmol/L; sorafenib, 0.1-0.2 nmol/L; masitinib, 0.2-0.5 nmol/L; nilotinib, 0.2-1.0 nmol/L; dasatinib, 0.5-2.0 nmol/L; sunitinib, 1-2 nmol/L; midostaurin, 5-10 nmol/L. These drugs were also found to block activation of PDGFR-downstream signaling molecules, including Akt, S6, and STAT5 in EOL-1 cells. All effective TKIs produced apoptosis in EOL-1 cells as determined by microscopy, Annexin-V/PI, and caspase-3 staining. In addition, PDGFR-targeting TKIs were found to inhibit cytokine-induced migration of EOL-1 cells. In all bioassays used, ponatinib was found to be the most potent compound in EOL-1 cells. In addition, ponatinib was found to downregulate expression of the activation-linked surface antigen CD63 on EOL-1 cells and to suppress the growth of primary neoplastic eosinophils. We also examined drug effects on Ba/F3 cells expressing two clinically relevant, imatinib-resistant, mutant forms of FIP1L1-PDGFRA, namely T674I and D842V. Strong inhibitory effects on both mutants were seen only with ponatinib. In summary, novel PDGFR-targeting TKIs may be alternative agents for the treatment of patients with imatinib-resistant chronic eosinophilic leukemia. Although several different PDGFR-targeting agents are effective, the most potent drug appears to be ponatinib.",cancer
1408,Demonstration of Protein-Based Human Identification Using the Hair Shaft Proteome.,"Human identification from biological material is largely dependent on the ability to characterize genetic polymorphisms in DNA. Unfortunately, DNA can degrade in the environment, sometimes below the level at which it can be amplified by PCR. Protein however is chemically more robust than DNA and can persist for longer periods. Protein also contains genetic variation in the form of single amino acid polymorphisms. These can be used to infer the status of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism alleles. To demonstrate this, we used mass spectrometry-based shotgun proteomics to characterize hair shaft proteins in 66 European-American subjects. A total of 596 single nucleotide polymorphism alleles were correctly imputed in 32 loci from 22 genes of subjects' DNA and directly validated using Sanger sequencing. Estimates of the probability of resulting individual non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism allelic profiles in the European population, using the product rule, resulted in a maximum power of discrimination of 1 in 12,500. Imputed non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphism profiles from European-American subjects were considerably less frequent in the African population (maximum likelihood ratio = 11,000). The converse was true for hair shafts collected from an additional 10 subjects with African ancestry, where some profiles were more frequent in the African population. Genetically variant peptides were also identified in hair shaft datasets from six archaeological skeletal remains (up to 260 years old). This study demonstrates that quantifiable measures of identity discrimination and biogeographic background can be obtained from detecting genetically variant peptides in hair shaft protein, including hair from bioarchaeological contexts.",nonCancer
708,Crizotinib in ALK-rearranged inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a distinctive mesenchymal neoplasm characterized by a spindle-cell proliferation with an inflammatory infiltrate. Approximately half of IMTs carry rearrangements of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) locus on chromosome 2p23, causing aberrant ALK expression. We report a sustained partial response to the ALK inhibitor crizotinib (PF-02341066, Pfizer) in a patient with ALK-translocated IMT, as compared with no observed activity in another patient without the ALK translocation. These results support the dependence of ALK-rearranged tumors on ALK-mediated signaling and suggest a therapeutic strategy for genomically identified patients with the aggressive form of this soft-tissue tumor.

29,Polyclonal evolution of multiple secondary KIT mutations in gastrointestinal stromal tumors under treatment with imatinib mesylate.,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are characterized by a strong KIT receptor activation most often resulting from KIT mutations. In a smaller subgroup of tumors without KIT mutations, analogous activating mutations are found in the platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRalpha) gene. Both PDGFRalpha and KIT receptors are targets of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib (Glivec) which has improved the treatment of advanced GISTs significantly. However, a subgroup of tumors show a secondary progress under therapy with imatinib after initial response. One possible mechanism of secondary resistance is the development of newly acquired KIT mutations. In the present study, we evaluated the frequency of such secondary KIT mutations in a series of GIST patients in which tumor tissue was resected under treatment. We examined one to seven different tumor areas in 32 cases (total of 104 samples) and found up to four newly acquired KIT mutations in 14 patients (43.8%). These were always located in exons encoding the first or second tyrosine kinase domain (exon 13, 14, or 17). Mutations were found only in a subset of samples analyzed from each case whereas others retained the wild-type sequence in the same region. There was never more than one new mutation in the same sample. Consistent with a secondary clonal evolution, the primary mutation was always detectable in all samples from each tumor. According to our results, the identification of newly acquired KIT mutations in addition to the primary mutation is dependent on the number of tissue samples analyzed and has high implications for further therapeutic strategies.",cancer
150,KRAS mutation in stage III colon cancer and clinical outcome following intergroup trial CALGB 89803.,"Alterations in the RAS and RAF pathway relate to epigenetic and epigenomic aberrations, and are important in colorectal carcinogenesis. KRAS mutation in metastatic colorectal cancer predicts resistance to anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapy (cetuximab or panitumumab). It remains uncertain, however, whether KRAS mutation predicts prognosis or clinical outcome of colon cancer patients independent of anti-EGFR therapy. We conducted a study of 508 cases identified among 1,264 patients with stage III colon cancer who enrolled in a randomized adjuvant chemotherapy trial (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin with or without irinotecan) in 1999-2001 (CALGB 89803). KRAS mutations were detected in 178 tumors (35%) by pyrosequencing. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard models assessed the prognostic significance of KRAS mutation and adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, tumor location, tumor/node stage, performance status, adjuvant chemotherapy arm, and microsatellite instability status. Compared with patients with KRAS-wild-type tumors, patients with KRAS-mutated tumors did not experience any difference in disease-free, recurrence-free, or overall survival. The 5-year disease-free, recurrence-free, and overall survival rates (KRAS-mutated versus KRAS-wild-type patients) were 62% versus 63% (log-rank P = 0.89), 64% versus 66% (P = 0.84), and 75% versus 73% (P = 0.56), respectively. The effect of KRAS mutation on patient survival did not significantly differ according to clinical features, chemotherapy arm, or microsatellite instability status, and the effect of adjuvant chemotherapy assignment on outcome did not differ according to KRAS status. In this large trial of chemotherapy in stage III colon cancer patients, KRAS mutational status was not associated with any significant influence on disease-free or overall survival.",cancer
2155,Molecular transport through capillaries made with atomic-scale precision.,"Nanometre-scale pores and capillaries have long been studied because of their importance in many natural phenomena and their use in numerous applications. A more recent development is the ability to fabricate artificial capillaries with nanometre dimensions, which has enabled new research on molecular transport and led to the emergence of nanofluidics. But surface roughness in particular makes it challenging to produce capillaries with precisely controlled dimensions at this spatial scale. Here we report the fabrication of narrow and smooth capillaries through van der Waals assembly, with atomically flat sheets at the top and bottom separated by spacers made of two-dimensional crystals with a precisely controlled number of layers. We use graphene and its multilayers as archetypal two-dimensional materials to demonstrate this technology, which produces structures that can be viewed as if individual atomic planes had been removed from a bulk crystal to leave behind flat voids of a height chosen with atomic-scale precision. Water transport through the channels, ranging in height from one to several dozen atomic planes, is characterized by unexpectedly fast flow (up to 1 metre per second) that we attribute to high capillary pressures (about 1,000 bar) and large slip lengths. For channels that accommodate only a few layers of water, the flow exhibits a marked enhancement that we associate with an increased structural order in nanoconfined water. Our work opens up an avenue to making capillaries and cavities with sizes tunable to ångström precision, and with permeation properties further controlled through a wide choice of atomically flat materials available for channel walls.",nonCancer
1244,PTPRF Expression as a Potential Prognostic/Predictive Marker for Treatment with Erlotinib in Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer.,"EGFR mutations and anaplastic lymphoma kinase rearrangements are, to date, the only approved biomarkers to select treatment for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is considerable interest in identifying other predictive markers. The PTPRF gene has been suggested as a marker of interest in NSCLC and other tumor types. This hypothesis-generating retrospective analysis examined data from two studies of erlotinib in NSCLC, Marker Identification Trial (MERIT; n = 102) and Sequential Tarceva in Unresectable NSCLC (SATURN; n = 262), to determine whether PTPRF expression was prognostic and/or predictive of patient outcomes. Exploratory analyses were conducted using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on existing formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples, to assess gene expression levels, including PTPRF. High versus low levels of expression were dichotomized using the median with B2M as a control comparator. Progression-free survival and overall survival were then compared for patients with high versus low levels of PTPRF in the two studies. PTPRF expression was found to be prognostic for shorter overall survival but was also significantly predictive of improved survival with erlotinib versus placebo in SATURN (hazard ratio, 0.45 [95% confidence interval, CI, 0.30-0.69] in PTPRF high versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62-1.48] in PTPRF low; interaction p = 0.02), even in the EGFR wild-type subpopulation (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.44 [95% CI, 0.29-0.68] versus 0.96 [95% CI, 0.62-1.48]; interaction p = 0.01). PTPRF may have value as a predictive marker to identify which patients can obtain the greatest benefit from erlotinib in the post-first-line setting. Further research is warranted to determine the potential value of this marker in clinical decision-making.",cancer
634,Overexpression of DDX43 mediates MEK inhibitor resistance through RAS Upregulation in uveal melanoma cells.,"The majority of uveal melanomas carry oncogenic mutations in the G proteins GNAQ and GNA11, with consequent activation of the MAPK pathway. Selective MEK inhibitors, such as selumetinib, have shown clinical benefit in uveal melanoma. However, mechanisms of drug resistance limit their efficacy in some patients. Analysis of MEK inhibitor-resistant uveal melanoma cell lines revealed the induction of RAS protein expression and activity. This effect was mediated by the RNA helicase DDX43, which was remarkably overexpressed in these cells. Depletion of DDX43 in MEK inhibitor-resistant cells decreased RAS proteins and inhibited ERK and AKT pathways. On the contrary, ectopic expression of DDX43 in parental uveal melanoma cells induced RAS protein levels and rendered cells resistant to MEK inhibition. Similar to DDX43 depletion, downregulation of KRAS, HRAS, and NRAS inhibited downstream pathways in the resistant cells, overcoming mutant GNAQ signaling. We also analyzed the expression of DDX43 in liver metastases of patients with uveal melanoma by RT-PCR, and found a significant overexpression of DDX43 in patients who did not benefit from selumetinib therapy. In conclusion, DDX43 induces RAS protein expression and signaling, mediating a novel mechanism of MEK inhibitor resistance. The detection of DDX43 in patients with uveal melanoma could lead to more targeted therapies for this disease.",cancer
560,Nimotuzumab enhances temozolomide-induced growth suppression of glioma cells expressing mutant EGFR in vivo.,"A mutant form of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), EGFRvIII, is common in glioblastoma (GBM) and confers enhanced tumorigenic activity and drug resistance. Nimotuzumab, an anti-EGFR antibody, has shown preclinical and clinical activity to GBM, but its specific activity against EGFRvIII has not been fully investigated. Human glioma U87MG or LNZ308 cells overexpressing either wild-type (wt) EGFR or EGFRvIII were treated with nimotuzumab, temozolomide, or both. Expression and phosphorylation status of molecules were determined by Western blot analysis. Methylation status of promoter region of O(6) -methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) was detected by methylation-specific PCR. Antitumor activity was tested using nude mice bearing either subcutaneous or intracerebral xenografts along with analyses of EGFR phosphorylation status, proliferation, apoptosis, and vessel density. Nimotuzumab treatment resulted in reduction of EGFRvIII tyrosine phosphorylation with a decrease in Akt phosphorylation that was greater than that of wtEGFR. Correspondingly, antitumor effects, growth suppression and survival elongation, were more significant in mice bearing either subcutaneous or intracerebral tumor expressing EGFRvIII than in those expressing wtEGFR. These effects were markedly increased when temozolomide was combined with nimotuzumab. The post-treatment recurrent brain tumors exhibited a decrease in expression of the mismatch repair (MMR) proteins, MSH6 and MLH1, but their methylated MGMT status did not changed. Nimotuzumab has in vivo antitumor activity against GBM, especially those expressing EGFRvIII, when combined with temozolomide. This could provide a basis for preselection of patients with GBM by EGFR status who might benefit from the nimotuzumab and temozolomide combination therapy.",cancer
665,Activation of MET via diverse exon 14 splicing alterations occurs in multiple tumor types and confers clinical sensitivity to MET inhibitors.,"Focal amplification and activating point mutation of the MET gene are well-characterized oncogenic drivers that confer susceptibility to targeted MET inhibitors. Recurrent somatic splice site alterations at MET exon 14 (METex14) that result in exon skipping and MET activation have been characterized, but their full diversity and prevalence across tumor types are unknown. Here, we report analysis of tumor genomic profiles from 38,028 patients to identify 221 cases with METex14 mutations (0.6%), including 126 distinct sequence variants. METex14 mutations are detected most frequently in lung adenocarcinoma (3%), but also frequently in other lung neoplasms (2.3%), brain glioma (0.4%), and tumors of unknown primary origin (0.4%). Further in vitro studies demonstrate sensitivity to MET inhibitors in cells harboring METex14 alterations. We also report three new patient cases with METex14 alterations in lung or histiocytic sarcoma tumors that showed durable response to two different MET-targeted therapies. The diversity of METex14 mutations indicates that diagnostic testing via comprehensive genomic profiling is necessary for detection in a clinical setting. Here we report the identification of diverse exon 14 splice site alterations in MET that result in constitutive activity of this receptor and oncogenic transformation in vitro. Patients whose tumors harbored these alterations derived meaningful clinical benefit from MET inhibitors. Collectively, these data support the role of METex14 alterations as drivers of tumorigenesis, and identify a unique subset of patients likely to derive benefit from MET inhibitors.",cancer
378,Blocking NRG1 and other ligand-mediated Her4 signaling enhances the magnitude and duration of the chemotherapeutic response of non-small cell lung cancer.,"Although standard chemotherapies are commonly used to treat most types of solid tumors, such treatment often results in inadequate response to, or relapse after, therapy. This is particularly relevant for lung cancer because most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and are treated with frontline chemotherapy. By studying the residual tumor cells that remain after chemotherapy in several in vivo non-small cell lung cancer models, we found that these cells have increased levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER) signaling due, in part, to the enrichment of a preexisting NRG1(HI) subpopulation. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) signaling in these models can be mediated by either the HER3 or HER4 receptor, resulting in the differential activation of downstream effectors. Inhibition of NRG1 signaling inhibits primary tumor growth and enhances the magnitude and duration of the response to chemotherapy. Moreover, we show that inhibition of ligand-mediated Her4 signaling impedes disease relapse in cases where NRG1 inhibition is insufficient. These findings demonstrate that ligand-dependent Her4 signaling plays an important role in disease relapse.",cancer

Both comparative and observational studies were included. We excluded irrelevant articles, editorials, case reports, reviews, and meta-analyses. The studies that followed the patients less than 6 mo were excluded. Variables collected were demographic data of the patients, technique of BTX-A injection and number of sessions, short-term and long-term clinical improvement, post-injection changes in electromyography (EMG), defecography, manometry, and balloon expulsion test, and complications recorded after BTX-A injection.|Seven studies comprising 189 patients were included in the review. The median age of the patients was 41.2 years and female-to-male ratio was 1.3:1. The median dose of BTX-A injected per procedure was 100 IU (range, 20-100 IU). Lateral injection was done in five trails and combined lateral and posterior injections in two trials. Three studies used endorectal ultrasonography-guided technique, one study used EMG-guided technique, whereas the remaining three studies used manual palpation with the index finger. The median percentage of patients who reported initial improvement of symptoms was 77.4% (range 37.5%-86.7%), this percentage declined to a median of 46% (range 25%-100%) at 4 mo after injection of BTX-A. Rates of improvement evaluated by balloon expulsion test, EMG, and defecography ranged between (37.5%-80%), (54%-86.7%), and (25%-86.6%), respectively. Fourteen (7.4%) patients developed complications after injection of BTX-A. Complication rates across the studies ranged from 0% to 22.6%.|Initial satisfactory improvement of symptoms after BTX-A injection remarkably deteriorated after 3 mo of the procedure. However, repeated injection may provide better sustained results with no additional morbidities. Further analysis of more patients is necessary to conclude the safety of BTX-A for the treatment of anismus.",nonCancer

218,Homogeneous EGFR amplification defines a subset of aggressive Barrett's adenocarcinomas with poor prognosis.,"The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a tyrosine kinase (TK) involved in the tumour progression of many cancer types and may serve as an important therapeutic target (erlotinib, cetuximab). Heterogeneity of EGFR amplification and expression could represent a major drawback for anti-EGFR therapy. The aim of this study was performed to determine the potential impact of tumour heterogeneity on anti-EGFR therapy in Barrett's adenocarcinoma (BAC). Tissue microarray (TMA) sections of 112 BAC and 45 lymph node metastases were analysed for EGFR amplification and expression using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). A subset of 20 samples was also sequenced for EGFR exons 18-21 and Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) exons 2-3 mutations. EGFR amplification was seen in seven (6.25%) of 112 interpretable BAC and typically high-level with more than 10-20 EGFR copies per tumour cell (EGFR/centromere 7 ratio >3). EGFR amplification was associated with high pT, pN and poor prognosis (P = 0.0004). Identical EGFR amplification status was found in 29 primary tumours and 29 matched lymph node metastases. Moreover, FISH analysis of three to 16 large sections from all amplified BAC and corresponding lymph node metastases did not reveal any heterogeneity of EGFR amplification. No EGFR mutation but one KRAS mutation was found. The high level and homogeneity of EGFR amplification in primary tumours and metastases suggests the potential therapeutic utility of anti-EGFR drugs in BAC.",cancer
2290,Proteomic profiling analysis reveals that glutathione system plays important roles responding to osmotic stress in wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) roots.,"Wheat is one of the most important crops in the world, and osmotic stress has become one of the main factors affecting wheat production. Understanding the mechanism of the response of wheat to osmotic stress would be greatly significant. In the present study, isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ) was used to analyze the changes of protein expression in the wheat roots exposed to different osmotic stresses. A total of 2,228 expressed proteins, including 81 differentially expressed proteins, between osmotic stress and control, were found. The comprehensive analysis of these differentially expressed proteins revealed that osmotic stress increased the variety of expressed proteins and suppressed the quantity of expressed proteins in wheat roots. Furthermore, the proteins for detoxifying and reactive oxygen species scavenging, especially the glutathione system, played important roles in maintaining organism balance in response to osmotic stress in wheat roots. Thus, the present study comprehensively describes the protein expression changes in wheat roots in response to osmotic stress, providing firmer foundation to further study the mechanism of osmotic resistance in wheat.",nonCancer

The T variant of the MGMT promoter-enhancer single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP; rs16906252) has been associated with the presence of MGMT promoter methylation in other cancers. We examined the association of the T allele of rs16906252 with glioblastoma development, tumor MGMT methylation, MGMT protein expression, and survival outcomes. Two independent temozolomide-treated glioblastoma cohorts-one Australian (Australian Genomics and Clinical Outcomes of Glioma, n = 163) and the other American (University of California Los Angeles/Kaiser Permanente Los Angeles, n = 159)-were studied. Allelic bisulphite sequencing was used to determine if methylation was specific to the T allele. Additionally, we compared the incidence of the T allele between glioblastoma cases and matched controls to assess whether it was a risk factor for developing MGMT methylated glioblastoma. Carriage of the T allele of the rs16906252 SNP was associated with both MGMT methylation and low MGMT protein expression and predicted significantly longer survival in temozolomide-treated patients with both MGMT methylated and nonmethylated glioblastoma. Methylation was linked to the T allele, inferring that the T variant plays a key role in the acquisition of MGMT methylation. Carriage of the T allele was associated with a significantly elevated risk of developing glioblastoma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.96; P = .013), increasing further when glioblastoma was classified by the presence of MGMT methylation (adjusted odds ratio, 2.86; P = .001). The T allele of the rs16906252 SNP is a key determinant in the acquisition of MGMT methylation in glioblastoma. Temozolomide-treated patients with the rs16906252 T genotype have better survival, irrespective of tumor methylation status.",cancer

Cohort studies assessing overall cancer risk in RRT patients published before May 29, 2015 were included following systematic searches with of PubMed, EMBASE and the reference lists of the studies retrieved. Random-effects meta-analyses were used to pool standardized incidence rates (SIRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Heterogeneity tests, sensitivity analyses and publication bias assessment were performed. A total of 18 studies including 22 cohort studies were eventually identified, which comprised a total of 1,528,719 patients. In comparison with the general population, the pooled SIR for patients with dialysis including non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC), dialysis excluding NMSC, transplantation including NMSC, transplantation excluding NMSC and RRT were 1.40 (95% CI, 1.36-1.45), 1.35 (95% CI, 1.23-1.50), 3.26 (95% CI, 2.29-4.63), 2.08 (95% CI, 1.73-2.50) and 2.01 (95% CI, 1.70-2.38), respectively. The cancer risk was particularly high in subgroups of large sample size trials, female patients, younger patients (age at first dialysis, 0-34 years; age at transplantation, 0-20 years), the first year of RRT and non-Asian transplant patients. A significant association was also found between RRT and the majority of organ-specific cancers. However, neither dialysis nor transplantation was associated with breast, body of uterus, colorectal or prostate cancer. Significant heterogeneity was found regarding the association between RRT and overall cancer as well as the majority of site-specific cancer types. However, this heterogeneity had no substantial influence on the pooled SIR for overall cancer in RRT according to the sensitivity analysis. Compared with the general population, RRT patients have a significantly increased risk of overall cancer and the majority of specific cancer types, particularly Kaposi sarcoma (KS), lip cancer and NMSC in patients subjected to kidney transplantation and cancer of the thyroid gland and kidney as well as myeloma in dialysis patients. Considering the high heterogeneity encountered, further high-quality studies are required.",nonCancer
158,The prognostic significance of IDH2 mutations in AML depends on the location of the mutation.,"We have investigated the prognostic significance of isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) mutations in 1473 younger adult acute myeloid leukemia patients treated in 2 United Kingdom Medical Research Council trials. An IDH2 mutation was present in 148 cases (10%), 80% at R140 and 20% at R172. Patient characteristics and outcome differed markedly between the 2 mutations. IDH2(R140) significantly correlated with nucleophosmin mutations (NPM1(MUT)), whereas IDH2(R172) cases generally lacked other molecular mutations. An IDH2(R140) mutation was an independent favorable prognostic factor for relapse (P = .004) and overall survival (P = .008), and there was no significant heterogeneity with regard to NPM1 or FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3/ITD) genotype. Relapse in FLT3/ITD(WT)NPM1(MUT)IDH2(R140) patients was lower than in favorable-risk cytogenetics patients in the same cohort (20% and 38% at 5 years, respectively). The presence of an IDH2(R172) mutation was associated with a significantly worse outcome than IDH2(R140), and relapse in FLT3/ITD(WT)NPM1(WT)IDH2(R172) patients was comparable with adverse-risk cytogenetics patients (76% and 72%, respectively).",cancer
2509,High-dose-rate intraluminal brachytherapy for paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome.,"Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS), also known as paraneoplasic pemphigus, involves the skin, internal organs and mucosa. PAMS-associated mortality may occur as a result of autoantibody formation against internal tumors and their infiltration into organs other than the skin lesions that characterize PAMS. The most common symptoms of PAMS include pain associated with continuous oral ulceration and resistance to pharmacological treatment. The present study reports the case of a 42-year-old female patient who was admitted with an 8-month history of erosive skin lesions within the trunk region, oral mucosa and vaginal mucosa. The patient was diagnosed with PAMS based on computed tomography scans and histological analyses of the lesions. The lymphoid hyperplasia in the retroperitoneum and lesions in the vaginal mucosa and trunk area were improved following pharmacological treatment and resection of the lymph node showing hyperplasia. However, the oral lesion was treated with intraluminal brachytherapy due to its resistance to long-term pharmacological treatment. The majority of the lesions were improved following treatment, in the absence of any severe side effects. In addition, neither worsening nor progression of the oral lesion was observed during the 4-year follow-up period.",nonCancer
1914,"Patient Reported Outcomes from HIV Facial Lipoatrophy Treatment With a Volumizing Hyaluronic Acid Filler: A Prospective, Open-Label, Phase I and II Study.","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) facial lipoatrophy (FLA) is associated with the use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and HIV disease. HIV FLA is primarily characterized by midface (cheeks and temples) volume loss, resulting in a ""sunken"" and aged appearance. Filler agents for treatment of HIV FLA can provide midface volumization and improve quality-of-life (QOL). A 20 mg/ml hyaluronic acid (HA) filler (Juvéderm Voluma® XC, Allergan plc, Irvine, CA) may provide an immediate, natural appearing facial enhancement outcome in one treatment. We hypothesized that this HA filler for treatment of HIV FLA is safe and efficacious and may help improve patients' QOL.<br/> OBJECTIVE: To provide patient reported outcomes from HA filler for treatment of HIV FLA and suggest recommendations on use of validated QOL outcome measures to assess patient concerns specific to HIV FLA.<br/> METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, phase I and II study to evaluate patient reported outcomes, in addition to safety and efficacy, of this HA filler for treatment of HIV FLA in 20 subjects at the Sacramento Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Mather, CA (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02342223). Outcome measures include the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and a subject satisfaction questionnaire (SSQ).<br/> RESULTS: Nineteen subjects completed the 12-month follow-up. There was no significant improvement of DLQI score. Subject comments revealed high degree of satisfaction and there were no negative comments on the SSQ.<br/> CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we report that all subjects that completed this study were satisfied and had subjective improvement of their QOL post-treatment. We recommend against use of DLQI in the future as it may not fully encompass the emotional and mental health aspects that may be affected from HIV FLA. We recommend use of the Facial Appearance Inventory (FAI) and FACE-Q in future studies for HA filler treatment of HIV FLA. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1064-1069.",nonCancer
1725,Mental Rotation with Egocentric and Object-Based Transformations.,"Two experiments were conducted to address methodological issues with past studies investigating the influence of egocentric and object-based transformations on performance and sex differences in mental rotation. In previous work, the egocentric and object-based mental rotation tasks confounded the stimulus type (embodied vs. non embodied) and transformation task (egocentric vs. object-based). In both experiments presented here, the same stimuli were used regardless of the type of transformation but task instructions were modified to induce either egocentric (left-right judgment) or object-based (same-different judgment) processing. Experiment 1 used pairs of letters whereas Experiment 2 presented pairs of line-drawings of human hands. For both experiments, it was hypothesized that the mental rotation slope for response time would be steeper for object-based than for egocentric transformations. This hypothesis was verified in both experiments. Furthermore, Experiments 2 showed a reduced male advantage for egocentric compared to object-based rotations, whereas this pattern was reversed for Experiment 1. In conclusion, the present study showed that the influence of the type of transformation involved in mental rotation can be examined with the same set of stimuli simply by modifying task instructions.",nonCancer
330,Inhibition of PI3Kβ signaling with AZD8186 inhibits growth of PTEN-deficient breast and prostate tumors alone and in combination with docetaxel.,"Loss of PTEN protein results in upregulation of the PI3K/AKT pathway, which appears dependent on the PI3Kβ isoform. Inhibitors of PI3Kβ have potential to reduce growth of tumors in which loss of PTEN drives tumor progression. We have developed a small-molecule inhibitor of PI3Kβ and PI3Kδ (AZD8186) and assessed its antitumor activity across a panel of cell lines. We have then explored the antitumor effects as single agent and in combination with docetaxel in triple-negative breast (TNBC) and prostate cancer models. In vitro, AZD8186 inhibited growth of a range of cell lines. Sensitivity was associated with inhibition of the AKT pathway. Cells sensitive to AZD8186 (GI50 < 1 μmol/L) are enriched for, but not exclusively associated with, PTEN deficiency. In vivo, AZD8186 inhibits PI3K pathway biomarkers in prostate and TNBC tumors. Scheduling treatment with AZD8186 shows antitumor activity required only intermittent exposure, and that increased tumor control is achieved when AZD8186 is used in combination with docetaxel. AZD8186 is a potent inhibitor of PI3Kβ with activity against PI3Kδ signaling, and has potential to reduce growth of tumors dependent on dysregulated PTEN for growth. Moreover, AZD8186 can be combined with docetaxel, a chemotherapy commonly used to treat advanced TBNC and prostate tumors. The ability to schedule AZD8186 and maintain efficacy offers opportunity to combine AZD8186 more effectively with other drugs.",cancer
557,Phase I Study to Assess the Combination of Afatinib with Trastuzumab in Patients with Advanced or Metastatic HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.,"The HER2 mAb, trastuzumab, is a standard therapy for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer before acquired resistance. Afatinib, an irreversible, oral, small-molecule ErbB family blocker, shows clinical activity in trastuzumab-refractory HER2-positive breast cancer. This phase I study used a 3+3 dose escalation to determine the MTD of oral once-daily afatinib in combination with the recommended dose of intravenous trastuzumab (4 mg/kg week 1; 2 mg/kg/wk thereafter). Adult women with confirmed advanced/metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer were eligible. Of 18 patients treated, 16 received daily afatinib 20 mg and two 30 mg. Overall, 4 of 13 and 2 of 2 patients receiving afatinib 20 mg and 30 mg, respectively, experienced dose-limiting toxicity (DLT; all CTCAE grade 3 diarrhea). Most frequent treatment-related adverse events were diarrhea (94%), rash (56%), and fatigue (56%). Overall, pharmacokinetic profiles of afatinib and trastuzumab in combination were consistent with the known characteristics of each alone. Overall, objective response and disease control rates were 11% and 39%, respectively, with median progression-free survival 111.0 days (95% confidence interval, 56.0-274.0). The MTD of afatinib was 20 mg daily combined with the recommended weekly dose of trastuzumab, with 1 of 6 patients showing DLTs in the dose escalation. However, additional DLTs occurred in the dose-expansion phase meaning that this MTD cannot be recommended for phase II development without strict diarrhea management. There was no evidence suggesting relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions. Signs of clinical activity were seen in trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive breast cancer, suggesting further investigation with optimal diarrhea management is warranted.",cancer
1887,Prolactin-Inducible Protein: From Breast Cancer Biomarker to Immune Modulator-Novel Insights from Knockout Mice.,"The propensity for breast cancers to elicit immune responses in patients is well established. The accumulation of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes within the primary breast tumor has been linked to better prognosis and better response to therapy. The prolactin-inducible protein (PIP) is a 15 kD protein that is expressed under physiological conditions of the breast and is regarded as a marker of mammary differentiation. While highly expressed under pathological conditions of the mammary gland, including breast cancers, PIP is expressed in very few other cancers. Although the function of PIP is not well elucidated, numerous studies suggest that its primary role may be related to host defense and immune modulation. However, evidence to show a direct link between PIP and the immune response has been lacking. In this review, we discuss our recent work with Pip-deficient mice, linking PIP not only to a role in innate immunity but for the first time, providing evidence for a role in cell-mediated immunity. These functional studies in Pip null mice lend new insight into the role of PIP in immunity and suggest that PIP may play a similar immune-regulatory role in breast cancer.",nonCancer
858,High CDK6 Protects Cells from Fulvestrant-Mediated Apoptosis and is a Predictor of Resistance to Fulvestrant in Estrogen Receptor-Positive Metastatic Breast Cancer.,"Resistance to endocrine therapy in estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer remains a major clinical problem. Recently, the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib combined with letrozole or fulvestrant was approved for treatment of ER(+) advanced breast cancer. However, the role of CDK4/6 in endocrine resistance and their potential as predictive biomarkers of endocrine treatment response remains undefined. We investigated the specific role of increased CDK6 expression in fulvestrant-resistant cells by gene knockdown and treatment with palbociclib, and evaluated the effect in cell proliferation, apoptosis, and kinase activity. Furthermore, we evaluated CDK6 expression in metastatic samples from breast cancer patients treated or not with fulvestrant. We found increased expression of CDK6 in two fulvestrant-resistant cell models versus sensitive cells. Reduction of CDK6 expression impaired fulvestrant-resistant cell growth and induced apoptosis. Treatment with palbociclib resensitized fulvestrant-resistant cells to fulvestrant through alteration of retinoblastoma protein phosphorylation. High CDK6 levels in metastatic samples from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients treated with fulvestrant (N = 45 and 46) correlated significantly with shorter progression-free survival (PFS) on fulvestrant treatment (P = 0.0006 and 0.018), whereas no association was observed in patients receiving other first- or second-/third-line endocrine treatments (N = 68, P = 0.135 and 0.511, respectively). Our results indicate that upregulation of CDK6 may be an important mechanism in overcoming fulvestrant-mediated growth inhibition in breast cancer cells. Patients with advanced ER(+) breast cancer exhibiting high CDK6 expression in the metastatic lesions show shorter PFS upon fulvestrant treatment and thus may benefit from the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors in their therapeutic regimens.

696,"MEK162 for patients with advanced melanoma harbouring NRAS or Val600 BRAF mutations: a non-randomised, open-label phase 2 study.","Patients with melanoma harbouring Val600 BRAF mutations benefit from treatment with BRAF inhibitors. However, no targeted treatments exist for patients with BRAF wild-type tumours, including those with NRAS mutations. We aimed to assess the use of MEK162, a small-molecule MEK1/2 inhibitor, in patients with NRAS-mutated or Val600 BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma. In our open-label, non-randomised, phase 2 study, we assigned patients with NRAS-mutated or BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma to one of three treatment arms on the basis of mutation status. Patients were enrolled at university hospitals or private cancer centres in Europe and the USA. The three arms were: twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for NRAS-mutated melanoma, twice-daily MEK162 45 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma, and twice-daily MEK162 60 mg for BRAF-mutated melanoma. Previous treatment with BRAF inhibitors was permitted, but previous MEK inhibitor therapy was not allowed. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who had an objective response (ie, a complete response or confirmed partial response). We report data for the 45 mg groups. We assessed clinical activity in all patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 and in patients assessable for response (with two available CT scans). This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01320085, and is currently recruiting additional patients with NRAS mutations (based on a protocol amendment). Between March 31, 2011, and Jan 17, 2012, we enrolled 71 patients who received at least one dose of MEK162 45 mg. By Feb 29, 2012 (data cutoff), median follow-up was 3·3 months (range 0·6-8·7; IQR 2·2-5·0). No patients had a complete response. Six (20%) of 30 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma had a partial response (three confirmed) as did eight (20%) of 41 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma (two confirmed). The most frequent adverse events were acneiform dermatitis (18 [60%] patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and 15 [37%] patients with the BRAF-mutated melanoma), rash (six [20%] and 16 [39%]), peripheral oedema (ten [33%] and 14 [34%]), facial oedema (nine [30%] and seven [17%]), diarrhoea (eight [27%] and 15 [37%]), and creatine phosphokinase increases (11 [37%] and nine [22%]). Increased creatine phosphokinase was the most common grade 3-4 adverse event (seven [23%] and seven [17%]). Four patients had serious adverse events (two per arm), which included diarrhoea, dehydration, acneiform dermatitis, general physical deterioration, irregular heart rate, malaise, and small intestinal perforation. No deaths occurred from treatment-related causes. To our knowledge, MEK162 is the first targeted therapy to show activity in patients with NRAS -mutated melanoma and might offer a new option for a cancer with few effective treatments.

1900,The Effects of a Daily Skincare Regimen on Maintaining the Benefits Obtained from Previous Chemical Resurfacing Treatments.,"Chemical peels are versatile treatments that involve chemical exfoliation of the skin for cosmetic improvement. Deeper peels produce more significant results, but can be associated with longer healing time and potential complications. Novel chemical resurfacing treatments (AGE and MELA) were developed in Europe to produce skin resurfacing via controlled inflammation to promote cell regeneration with minimum negative effects associated with conventional peelings. The AGE Resurfacing regimen is indicated for the treatment of photoaging, and consists of multi-ingredient peeling solution with trichloroacetic acid, pyruvic acid, salicylic acid, mandelic acid, and lactobionic acid. The MELA Resurfacing regimen addresses hyperpigmentation concerns and contains mandelic acid, potassium azeloyl diglycinate, retinol, salicylic acid, phytic acid, lactobionic acid, and lactic acid. Results of previously conducted US clinical experience trial of AGE and MELA resurfacing protocols rated 81% of subjects with some level of improvement according to physician assessment.<br/> OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether a daily skin care regimen used for 12 weeks could maintain the benefits achieved with AGE and MELA chemical resurfacing treatments.<br/> METHODS: Subjects who completed participation in the AGE and MELA skin resurfacing clinical trial were recruited to participate in a continuation trial and used a daily regimen of MDRejuvena facial products for 12 weeks. No other facial products were permitted. Physicians assessed the severity of individual skin parameters at baseline and week 12 and provided global assessment. Subjects assessed improvement of individual skin parameters at week 12 and provided an overall assessment.<br/> RESULTS: Thirteen subjects participated in the 12-week continuation trial. According to the physician's global assessment, all subjects demonstrated some level of improvement at week 12 compared to baseline. Physician assessment showed a decrease in severity of all skin parameters assessed at week 12 compared to baseline. According to the subject overall assessment at week 12, 11 of 12 subjects noted some level of improvement, 1 subject saw no improvement, and 1 subject did not provide an overall assessment. Mild to moderate improvement was observed by subjects in all individual skin parameters assessed except for skin discoloration.<BR /> CONCLUSIONS: The results of the continuation study demonstrate that use of a daily skin care regimen, which include combination of 2 various strengths of MDRejuvena Rejuvaphyl<sup>®</sup> Rejuvenating Complex: low strength (LS) and high strength (HS), not only maintains but can enhance the beneficial effects of skin resurfacing treatments for at least 12 weeks. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1145-1150.",nonCancer
1567,Mercury-Pollution Induction of Intracellular Lipid Accumulation and Lysosomal Compartment Amplification in the Benthic Foraminifer Ammonia parkinsoniana.,"Heavy metals such as mercury (Hg) pose a significant health hazard through bioaccumulation and biomagnification. By penetrating cell membranes, heavy metal ions may lead to pathological conditions. Here we examined the responses of Ammonia parkinsoniana, a benthic foraminiferan, to different concentrations of Hg in the artificial sea water. Confocal images of untreated and treated specimens using fluorescent probes (Nile Red and Acridine Orange) provided an opportunity for visualizing the intracellular lipid accumulation and acidic compartment regulation. With increased Hg over time, we observed an increased number of lipid droplets, which may have acted as a detoxifying organelle where Hg is sequestered and biologically inactivated. Further, Hg seems to promote the proliferation of lysosomes both in terms of number and dimension that, at the highest level of Hg, resulted in cell death. We report, for the first time, the presence of Hg within the foraminiferal cell: at the basal part of pores, in the organic linings of the foramen/septa, and as cytoplasmic accumulations.",nonCancer

1613,"Risk of sudden sensorineural hearing loss in stroke patients: A 5-year nationwide investigation of 44,460 patients.","Poststroke sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) can hinder communication between patients and healthcare professionals, thereby restricting participation in rehabilitation programs and limiting improvements in physical performance. However, the relationship between stroke and SSNHL remains unclear. This study employed a nationwide population-based dataset to investigate the relationship between stroke and SSNHL.The Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database was used to compile data from 11,115 stroke patients and a comparison cohort of 33,345 matched nonstroke enrollees. Each patient was followed for 5 years to identify new-onset SSNHL. Stratified Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis was used to examine the association of stroke with subsequent SSNHL.Among the 44,460 patients, 66 patients (55,378 person-years) from the stroke cohort and 105 patients (166,586 person-years) from the comparison cohort were diagnosed with SSNHL. The incidence of SSNHL was approximately twice as high among stroke patients than among nonstroke patients (1.19 and 0.63/1000 person-years, respectively). Stroke patients had a 71% increased risk of SSNHL, compared with nonstroke patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.71, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.24-2.36). We also observed a remarkable increase in risk of SSNHL in stroke patients within 1-year of follow-up (adjusted HR 5.65, 95% CI 3.07-10.41) or under steroid therapy during hospitalization (adjusted HR 5.14, 95% CI 2.08-12.75).Patients with stroke had a higher risk of subsequent SSNHL compared with patients without stroke. In particular, stroke patients within 1-year follow-up and those undergoing steroid therapy during hospitalization should be treated with the utmost caution, considering that the risk of SSNHL increases by more than 5-fold.",nonCancer
753,Feasibility of novel PPP1R15A and proposed ANXA11 single nucleotide polymorphisms as predictive markers for bevacizumab regimen in metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Bevacizumab improves survival in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) under chemotherapy, but few predictive markers have been identified. To investigate chemosensitive single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of mCRC, we performed exome sequencing and RNA sequencing in 19 patients. A clinical association analysis was performed with the other 116 patients who had received chemotherapy to bevacizumab regimens. In vivo biodistribution studies and [(18)F]FDG-PET imaging were performed on mice bearing human colorectal cancer (HCT116 and SW480) xenografts after injection of bevacizumab with 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI). PPP1R15A rs557806 showed the most significant association with FRB-driven tumor IR in exome sequencing and the highest correlation (r = 0.74) with drug responses in RNA sequencing. Patients homozygous for the reference alleles (GG) of PPP1R15A rs557806 exhibited greater disease control rate and a tendency toward greater objective response rate (ORR) than those with homozygous or heterozygous substitution alleles (GC and CC; P = 0.027 and 0.073, respectively). In xenografted mice, HCT116 clones transfected with the G allele at PPP1R15A rs557806 were more sensitive to bevacizumab regimens than those with the C allele. Tumor volume of xenografts with the G allele was significantly lower than that of xenografts with the C allele (P = 0.004, day 13). [(18)F]FDG uptake decreased to 75 % in HCT116 xenograft-bearing mice with the G allele, whereas [(18)F]FDG uptake was 42 % in mice xenografts with the C allele (P = 0.032). ANXA11 rs1049550, a predictive biomarker of SNP described in our previous study, was validated using the xenograft model. Tumor volume and [(18)F]FDG uptake analyses showed that tumors in the SW480 xenografts expressing the substitution allele (T) at ANXA11 rs1049550 were more susceptible to FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab-induced suppression than those expressing the reference allele (C) (P = 0.001 and 0.026, respectively). ANXA11 rs1049550 and PPP1R15A rs557806 may improve the identification of mCRC patients sensitive to bevacizumab regimens, and further validation is required in large cohorts.",cancer
2327,A horizon scan of future threats and opportunities for pollinators and pollination.,"Background. Pollinators, which provide the agriculturally and ecologically essential service of pollination, are under threat at a global scale. Habitat loss and homogenisation, pesticides, parasites and pathogens, invasive species, and climate change have been identified as past and current threats to pollinators. Actions to mitigate these threats, e.g., agri-environment schemes and pesticide-use moratoriums, exist, but have largely been applied post-hoc. However, future sustainability of pollinators and the service they provide requires anticipation of potential threats and opportunities before they occur, enabling timely implementation of policy and practice to prevent, rather than mitigate, further pollinator declines. Methods.Using a horizon scanning approach we identified issues that are likely to impact pollinators, either positively or negatively, over the coming three decades. Results.Our analysis highlights six high priority, and nine secondary issues. High priorities are: (1) corporate control of global agriculture, (2) novel systemic pesticides, (3) novel RNA viruses, (4) the development of new managed pollinators, (5) more frequent heatwaves and drought under climate change, and (6) the potential positive impact of reduced chemical use on pollinators in non-agricultural settings. Discussion. While current pollinator management approaches are largely driven by mitigating past impacts, we present opportunities for pre-emptive practice, legislation, and policy to sustainably manage pollinators for future generations.",nonCancer

X-ray diffraction and morphological analyses show that successfully exfoliated rGO sponge consists of on average 4.2 graphene sheets, maintaining its three dimensional structure with highly oriented morphology even after the thermal reduction procedure. Lithium ion hybrid capacitors (LIC) are fabricated in this study based on a unique cell configuration which completely eliminates the pre-doping process of lithium ions. The full-cell LIC consisting of AC/HOG-Li configuration has resulted in remarkable high energy densities of 231.7 and 131.9 Wh kg-1 obtained at 57 W kg-1 and 2.8 kW kg-1. This excellent performance is attributed to the lithium ion diffusivity related to the intercalation reaction of AC/HOG-Li which is 3.6 times higher that of AC/CG-Li. This unique cell design and configuration of LIC presented in this study using HOG as an effective anode is an unprecedented example of performance enhancement and improved energy density of LIC through succesful increase in cell operation voltage window.",nonCancer
65,FLT3-ITD-TKD dual mutants associated with AML confer resistance to FLT3 PTK inhibitors and cytotoxic agents by overexpression of Bcl-x(L).,"FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) is constitutively activated in about 30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and represents a disease-specific molecular marker. Although FLT3-LM (length mutation) and TKD (tyrosine kinase domain) mutations have been considered to be mutually exclusive, 1% to 2% of patients carry both mutations. However, the functional and clinical significance of this observation is unclear. We demonstrate that FLT3-ITD-TKD dual mutants induce drug resistance toward PTK inhibitors and cytotoxic agents in in vitro model systems. As molecular mechanisms of resistance, we found that FLT3-ITD-TKD mutants cause hyperactivation of STAT5 (signal transducer and activator of transcription-5), leading to upregulation of Bcl-x(L) and RAD51 and arrest in the G(2)M phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of Bcl-x(L) was identified as the critical mediator of drug resistance and recapitulates the PTK inhibitor and daunorubicin-resistant phenotype in FLT3-ITD cells. The combination of rapamycin, a selective mTOR inhibitor, and FLT3 PTK inhibitors restored the drug sensitivity in FLT3 dual mutant-expressing cells. Our data provide the molecular basis for understanding clinical FLT3 PTK inhibitor resistance and point to therapeutical strategies to overcome drug resistance in patients with AML.",cancer

721,Programmed death-ligand 1 overexpression is a prognostic marker for aggressive papillary thyroid cancer and its variants.,"Programmed death-ligand 1(PD-L1) expression on tumor cells is emerging as a potential predictive biomarker in anti-PD-L1 directed cancer immunotherapy. We analyzed PD-L1 expression in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and its variants and determined its prognostic potential to predict clinical outcome in these patients. This study was conducted at an academic oncology hospital which is a prime referral centre for thyroid diseases. Immunohistochemical subcellular localization (IHC) analyses of PD-L1 protein was retrospectively performed on 251 archived formalin fixed and paraffin embedded (FFPE) surgical tissues (66 benign thyroid nodules and 185 PTCs) using a rabbit monoclonal anti-PD-L1 antibody (E1L3N, Cell Signaling Technology) and detected using VECTASTAIN rapid protocol with diaminobenzidine (DAB) as the chromogen. The clinical-pathological factors and disease outcome over 190 months were assessed; immunohistochemical subcellular localization of PD-L1 was correlated with disease free survival (DFS) using Kaplan Meier survival and Cox multivariate regression analysis. Increased PD-L1 immunostaining was predominantly localized in cytoplasm and occasionally in plasma membrane of tumor cells. Among all combined stages of PTC, patients with increased PD-L1 membrane or cytoplasmic positivity had significantly shorter median DFS (36 months and 49 months respectively) as compared to those with PD-L1 negative tumors (DFS, both 186 months with p < 0.001 and p < 0.01 respectively). Comparison of PD-L1+ and PD-L1- patients with matched staging showed increased cytoplasmic positivity in all four stages of PTC that correlated with a greater risk of recurrence and a poor prognosis, but increased membrane positivity significantly correlated with a greater risk of metastasis or death only in Stage IV patients. In conclusion, PD-L1 positive expression in PTC correlates with a greater risk of recurrence and shortened disease free survival supporting its potential application as a prognostic marker for PTC.",cancer
701,Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce growth arrest and differentiation in uveal melanoma.,"Metastasis is responsible for the death of most cancer patients, yet few therapeutic agents are available which specifically target the molecular events that lead to metastasis. We recently showed that inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor gene BAP1 are closely associated with loss of melanocytic differentiation in uveal melanoma (UM) and metastasis. The purpose of this study was to identify therapeutic agents that reverse the phenotypic effects of BAP1 loss in UM. In silico screens were done to identify therapeutic compounds predicted to differentiate UM cells using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Connectivity Map databases. Valproic acid (VPA), trichostatin A, LBH-589, and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid were evaluated for their effects on UM cells using morphologic evaluation, MTS viability assays, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, flow cytometry, clonogenic assays, gene expression profiling, histone acetylation and ubiquitination assays, and a murine xenograft tumorigenicity model. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induced morphologic differentiation, cell-cycle exit, and a shift to a differentiated, melanocytic gene expression profile in cultured UM cells. VPA inhibited the growth of UM tumors in vivo. These findings suggest that HDAC inhibitors may have therapeutic potential for inducing differentiation and prolonged dormancy of micrometastatic disease in UM.",cancer
896,Targeting FGFR with dovitinib (TKI258): preclinical and clinical data in breast cancer.,"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) and FGFR2 amplifications are observed in approximately 10% of breast cancers and are related to poor outcomes. We evaluated whether dovitinib (TKI258), an inhibitor of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3, presented antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancers. Preclinical activity of dovitinib was evaluated in both breast cancer cell lines and an FGFR1-amplified xenograft model (HBCx2). Dovitinib was then evaluated in a phase II trial that included 4 groups of patients with human EGF receptor 2-negative metastatic breast cancer on the basis of FGFR1 amplification and hormone receptor (HR) status. FGFR1 amplification was assessed by silver in situ hybridization. Preplanned retrospective analyses assessed predictive value of FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGF3 amplifications by quantitative PCR (qPCR). Dovitinib monotherapy inhibits proliferation in FGFR1- and FGFR2-amplified, but not FGFR-normal, breast cancer cell lines. Dovitinib also inhibits tumor growth in FGFR1-amplified breast cancer xenografts. Eighty-one patients were enrolled in the trial. Unconfirmed response or stable disease for more than 6 months was observed in 5 (25%) and 1 (3%) patient(s) with FGFR1-amplified/HR-positive and FGFR1-nonamplified/HR-positive breast cancer. When qPCR-identified amplifications in FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGF3 were grouped to define an FGF pathway-amplified breast cancer in HR-positive patients, the mean reduction in target lesions was 21.1% compared with a 12.0% increase in patients who did not present with FGF pathway-amplified breast cancer. Dovitinib showed antitumor activity in FGFR-amplified breast cancer cell lines and may have activity in breast cancers with FGF pathway amplification.",cancer
2115,2015 Estimation of Hospitals Safety from Disasters in I.R.Iran: The Results from the Assessment of 421 Hospitals.,"Iran's health system has developed a Farsi edition of the Hospital Safety Index (HSI) and has integrated the related assessment program into the health information system. This article presents the results of the 2015 estimation of hospital safety from disasters in I.R.Iran using HSI.|We analyzed data from 421 hospitals that had submitted a complete HSI assessment form on the Ministry of Health and Medical Education Portal System. Data collection was based on the self-assessments of the hospital disaster committees. HSI includes 145 items categorized in three components including, structural, non-structural and functional capacity. For each item, safety status was categorized into three levels: not safe (0), average safety (1) and high safety (2). A normalized scoring scheme on a 100-point scale was developed. Hospitals were classified to three safety classes according to their normalized total score: low (≤34.0), average (34.01-66.0) and high (>66.0).|The average score of all safety components were 43.0 out of 100 (± 11.0). Eighty-two hospitals (19.4%) were classified as not safe, and 339 hospitals (80.6%) were classified in the average safety category. No hospital was placed in the high safety category. Average safety scores were 41.0, 47.0, and 42.0 for functional capacity, non-structural safety, and structural safety respectively. The average safety score increased between 2012 and 2015, from 34.0 to 43.0.|Hospital safety in the event of disasters has improved in Iran in recent years and more hospitals have joined the HSI program. This is a result of continuous efforts invested in capacity building programs and promotion of the 2012 HSI estimation. The HSI should be maintained to monitor the progress of Iran's health system in regards to hospital safety in the case of disasters. It is recommended that WHO continue advocacy of HSI, establish a HSI monitoring system, and add it to country profiles on WHO website.",nonCancer
2255,Targeted Disruption of Chlamydia trachomatis Invasion by in Trans Expression of Dominant Negative Tarp Effectors.,"Chlamydia trachomatis invasion of eukaryotic host cells is facilitated, in part, by the type III secreted effector protein, Tarp. The role of Tarp in chlamydiae entry of host cells is supported by molecular approaches that examined recombinant Tarp or Tarp effectors expressed within heterologous systems. A major limitation in the ability to study the contribution of Tarp to chlamydial invasion of host cells was the prior absence of genetic tools for chlamydiae. Based on our knowledge of Tarp domain structure and function along with the introduction of genetic approaches in C. trachomatis, we hypothesized that Tarp function could be disrupted in vivo by the introduction of dominant negative mutant alleles. We provide evidence that transformed C. trachomatis produced epitope tagged Tarp, which was secreted into the host cell during invasion. We examined the effects of domain specific Tarp mutations on chlamydial invasion and growth and demonstrate that C. trachomatis clones harboring engineered Tarp mutants lacking either the actin binding domain or the phosphorylation domain had reduced levels of invasion into host cells. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for the critical role of Tarp in C. trachomatis pathogenesis and indicate that chlamydial invasion of host cells can be attenuated via the introduction of engineered dominant negative type three effectors.",nonCancer
2445,"Influence of autologous dendritic cells on cytokine-induced killer cell proliferation, cell phenotype and antitumor activity in vitro.","Dendritic cell (DCs) are essential antigen processing and presentation cells that play a key role in the immune response. In this study, DCs were co-cultured with cytokine-induced killer cells (DC-CIKs) in vitro to detect changes in cell proliferation, cell phenotype and cell cytotoxicity. The results revealed that the DCs were suitable for co-culture with CIKs at day 7, and that cell quantity of DC-CIKs was lower than that of CIKs until day 11, but it was significantly improved to 1.17-fold that of CIKs at day 13. Flow cytometry was used to detect the cell phenotype of CIKs and DC-CIKs. Compared with CIKs at day 13, the percentage of CD3(+), CD3(+)CD4(+), CD3(+)CD8(+) and CD3(+)CD56(+) T cells in DC-CIKs was significantly improved 1.02, 1.79, 1.26 and 2.44-fold, respectively. In addition, trypan blue staining analysis demonstrated that the cell viability of CIKs and DC-CIKs was 96% and 98%, respectively. Furthermore, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) analysis verified that CIK and DC-CIK cytotoxicity in Hela cells was 58% and 80%, respectively, with a significant difference. Taken together, our results indicate that the cell proliferation, cell phenotype and antitumor activity of CIKs were all enhanced following co-culture with DCs in vitro. These results are likely to be useful for DC-CIK application in antitumor therapies.",nonCancer
2344,Effects of aging on the architecture of the ileocecal junction in rats.,"To evaluate the structural organization of the elastic and collagen fibers in the region of the ileocecal transition in 30 young and old male Wistar rats.|Histology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were employed in this study. The results demonstrated that there was a demarcation of the ileocecal region between the ileum and the cecum in both groups.|The connective tissue fibers had different distribution patterns in the two groups. IHC revealed the presence of nitric oxide synthase, enteric neurons and smooth muscle fibers in the ileocecal junctions (ICJs) of both groups. Compared to the young group, the elderly group exhibited an increase in collagen type I fibers, a decrease in collagen type III fibers, a decreased linear density of oxytalan elastic fibers, and a greater linear density of elaunin and mature elastic fibers.|The results revealed changes in the patterns of distribution of collagen and elastic fibers that may lead to a possible decrease in ICJ functionality.",nonCancer
523,Acquired EGFR C797S mutation mediates resistance to AZD9291 in non-small cell lung cancer harboring EGFR T790M.,"Here we studied cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) collected from subjects with advanced lung cancer whose tumors had developed resistance to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) AZD9291. We first performed next-generation sequencing of cfDNA from seven subjects and detected an acquired EGFR C797S mutation in one; expression of this mutant EGFR construct in a cell line rendered it resistant to AZD9291. We then performed droplet digital PCR on serial cfDNA specimens collected from 15 AZD9291-treated subjects. All were positive for the T790M mutation before treatment, but upon developing AZD9291 resistance three molecular subtypes emerged: six cases acquired the C797S mutation, five cases maintained the T790M mutation but did not acquire the C797S mutation and four cases lost the T790M mutation despite the presence of the underlying EGFR activating mutation. Our findings provide insight into the diversity of mechanisms through which tumors acquire resistance to AZD9291 and highlight the need for therapies that are able to overcome resistance mediated by the EGFR C797S mutation.",cancer
779,"Long-term survival and blast transformation in molecularly annotated essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis.","Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) mutations define polycythemia vera (PV). Calreticulin (CALR) and myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene (MPL) mutations are specific to JAK2-unmutated essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). We examined the effect of these mutations on long-term disease outcome. One thousand five hundred eighty-one patients from the Mayo Clinic (n = 826) and Italy (n = 755) were studied. Fifty-eight percent of Mayo patients were followed until death; median survivals were 19.8 years in ET (n = 292), 13.5 PV (n = 267; hazard ratio [HR], 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-2.2), and 5.9 PMF (n = 267; HR, 4.5; 95% CI, 3.5-5.7). The survival advantage of ET over PV was not affected by JAK2/CALR/MPL mutational status. Survival in ET was inferior to the age- and sex-matched US population (P < .001). In PMF (n = 428), but not in ET (n = 576), survival and blast transformation (BT) were significantly affected by mutational status; outcome was best in CALR-mutated and worst in triple-negative patients: median survival, 16 vs 2.3 years (HR, 5.1; 95% CI, 3.2-8.0) and BT, 6.5% vs 25% (HR, 7.6; 95% CI, 2.8-20.2), respectively. We conclude that life expectancy in morphologically defined ET is significantly reduced but remains superior to that of PV, regardless of mutational status. In PMF, JAK2/CALR/MPL mutational status is prognostically informative.",cancer
1192,Complete sequencing of TP53 predicts poor response to systemic therapy of advanced breast cancer.,"TP53 has been implicated in regulation of the cell cycle, DNA repair, and apoptosis. We studied, in primary breast tumors through direct cDNA sequencing of exons 2-11, whether TP53 gene mutations can predict response in patients with advanced disease to either first-line tamoxifen therapy (202 patients, of whom 55% responded) or up-front (poly)chemotherapy (41 patients, of whom 46% responded). TP53 mutations were detected in 90 of 243 (37%) tumors, and one-fourth of these mutations resulted in a premature termination of the protein. The mutations were observed in 32% (65 of 202) of the primary tumors of tamoxifen-treated patients and in 61% (25 of 41) of the primary tumors of the chemotherapy patients. TP53 mutation was significantly associated with a poor response to tamoxifen [31% versus 66%; odds ratio (OR), 0.22; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.42; P < 0.0001]. Patients with TP53 gene mutations in codons that directly contact DNA or with mutations in the zinc-binding domain loop L3 showed the lowest response to tamoxifen (18% and 15% response rates, respectively). TP53 mutations were related, although not significantly, to a poor response to up-front chemotherapy (36% versus 63%; OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.09-1.24). In multivariate analysis for response including the classical parameters age and menopausal status, disease-free interval, dominant site of relapse, and levels of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor, TP53 mutation was a significant predictor of poor response in the tamoxifen-treated group (OR, 0.29; 95% CI, 0.13-0.63; P = 0.0014). TP53-mutated and estrogen receptor-negative (<10 fmol/mg protein) tumors appeared to be the most resistant phenotype. Interestingly, the response of patients with TP53 mutations to chemotherapy after tamoxifen was not worse than that of patients without these mutations (50% versus 42%; OR, 1.35, nonsignificant). The median progression-free survival after systemic treatment was shorter for patients with a TP53 mutation than for patients with wild-type TP53 (6.6 and 0.6 months less for tamoxifen and up-front chemotherapy, respectively). In conclusion, TP53 gene mutation of the primary tumor is helpful in predicting the response of patients with metastatic breast disease to tamoxifen therapy. The type of mutation and its biological function should be considered in the analyses of the predictive value of TP53.",cancer
799,SF3B1 mutations constitute a novel therapeutic target in breast cancer.,"Mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing have been found to occur at relatively high frequencies in several tumour types including myelodysplastic syndromes, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, uveal melanoma, and pancreatic cancer, and at lower frequencies in breast cancer. To investigate whether dysfunction in RNA splicing is implicated in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we performed a re-analysis of published exome and whole genome sequencing data. This analysis revealed that mutations in spliceosomal component genes occurred in 5.6% of unselected breast cancers, including hotspot mutations in the SF3B1 gene, which were found in 1.8% of unselected breast cancers. SF3B1 mutations were significantly associated with ER-positive disease, AKT1 mutations, and distinct copy number alterations. Additional profiling of hotspot mutations in a panel of special histological subtypes of breast cancer showed that 16% and 6% of papillary and mucinous carcinomas of the breast harboured the SF3B1 K700E mutation. RNA sequencing identified differentially spliced events expressed in tumours with SF3B1 mutations including the protein coding genes TMEM14C, RPL31, DYNL11, UQCC, and ABCC5, and the long non-coding RNA CRNDE. Moreover, SF3B1 mutant cell lines were found to be sensitive to the SF3b complex inhibitor spliceostatin A and treatment resulted in perturbation of the splicing signature. Albeit rare, SF3B1 mutations result in alternative splicing events, and may constitute drivers and a novel therapeutic target in a subset of breast cancers.",cancer

Employing a unique simulation of altering individuals' BMIs and the literature on ""aesthetic labour"", the study suggests that, especially for women, being heavier, but still within a healthy BMI, deleteriously impacts on hireability ratings. The paper explores the gendered dimension of this prejudice by asking whether female employees at the upper end of a healthy BMI range are likely to be viewed more negatively than their overtly overweight male counterparts. The paper concludes by considering the implications of these findings.",nonCancer
2106,"Cigarette Smoke Induces Immune Responses to Vimentin in both, Arthritis-Susceptible and -Resistant Humanized Mice.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease marked by chronic synovial inflammation and both, genetic and environmental factors are involved in its pathogenesis. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) DRB1*0401 is associated with susceptibility to develop RA, while cigarette smoke (CS) exposure promotes seropositive disease with increased severity in DRB1*0401+ individuals. Smokers have higher levels of antibodies against citrullinated peptides. In this study, we determined whether the response to a known autoantigen, Vimentin (Vim) is shared epitope specific and how CS influences this response using transgenic-mice carrying RA-susceptible,*0401, and -resistant, *0402, genes. Following relatively brief exposure to CS, peptidyl arginine deiminase (PAD) enzyme expression was increased in murine lungs. Cigarette smoking led to production of Interferon (IFN)-γ with reduced levels of Interleukin (IL)-10 by splenocytes of *0401 mice. In contrast, CS augmented Th2 cytokines along with T-regulatory cells in *0402 mice. An increase in levels of antibodies to native and citrullinated Vim was observed in naïve mice of both strains following CS exposure. Our data showed that both arthritis-susceptible and -resistant mice can generate cellular and humoral immunity to Vim; however CS-induced modulation of host immunity is dependent on the interaction with the host HLA genes.",nonCancer
262,IKZF1 status as a prognostic feature in BCR-ABL1-positive childhood ALL.,"Childhood BCR-ABL1-positive B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) has an unfavorable outcome and shows high frequency of IKZF1 deletions. The prognostic value of IKZF1 deletions was evaluated in 2 cohorts of BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL patients, before tyrosine kinase inhibitors (pre-TKI) and after introduction of imatinib (in the European Study for Philadelphia-Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia [EsPhALL]). In 126/191 (66%) cases an IKZF1 deletion was detected. In the pre-TKI cohort, IKZF1-deleted patients had an unfavorable outcome compared with wild-type patients (4-year disease-free survival [DFS] of 30.0 ± 6.8% vs 57.5 ± 9.4%; P = .01). In the EsPhALL cohort, the IKZF1 deletions were associated with an unfavorable prognosis in patients stratified in the good-risk arm based on early clinical response (4-year DFS of 51.9 ± 8.8% for IKZF1-deleted vs 78.6 ± 13.9% for IKZF1 wild-type; P = .03), even when treated with imatinib (4-year DFS of 55.5 ± 9.5% for IKZF1-deleted vs 75.0 ± 21.7% for IKZF1 wild-type; P = .05). In conclusion, the highly unfavorable outcome for childhood BCR-ABL1-positive BCP-ALL with IKZF1 deletions, irrespective of imatinib exposure, underscores the need for alternative therapies. In contrast, good-risk patients with IKZF1 wild-type responded remarkably well to imatinib-containing regimens, providing a rationale to potentially avoid hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in this subset of patients.",cancer

Rats were exposed to chronic mild stress following middle cerebral artery occlusion. The occurrence of post-stroke depression was evaluated according to the changes in preference for sucrose and performance in a forced swimming test. Estrogen therapy significantly improved these neurological symptoms, indicating that estrogen is effective in treating post-stroke depression. Increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) expression was reported in the hippocampus of rats that had been treated with estrogen for two weeks, suggesting that BDNF expression may be an important contributor to the improvement of post-stroke depression that is observed following estrogen therapy.",nonCancer
1447,Anatomical and Gene Expression Changes in the Retinal Pigmented Epithelium Atrophy 1 (rpea1) Mouse: A Potential Model of Serous Retinal Detachment.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the rpea1 mouse whose retina spontaneously detaches from the underlying RPE as a potential model for studying the cellular effects of serous retinal detachment (SRD).|Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was performed immediately prior to euthanasia; retinal tissue was subsequently prepared for Western blotting, microarray analysis, immunocytochemistry, and light and electron microscopy (LM, EM).|By postnatal day (P) 30, OCT, LM, and EM revealed the presence of small shallow detachments that increased in number and size over time. By P60 in regions of detachment, there was a dramatic loss of PNA binding around cones in the interphotoreceptor matrix and a concomitant increase in labeling of the outer nuclear layer and rod synaptic terminals. Retinal pigment epithelium wholemounts revealed a patchy loss in immunolabeling for both ezrin and aquaporin 1. Anti-ezrin labeling was lost from small regions of the RPE apical surface underlying detachments at P30. Labeling for tight-junction proteins provided a regular array of profiles outlining the periphery of RPE cells in wild-type tissue, however, this pattern was disrupted in the mutant as early as P30. Microarray analysis revealed a broad range of changes in genes involved in metabolism, signaling, cell polarity, and tight-junction organization.|These data indicate changes in this mutant mouse that may provide clues to the underlying mechanisms of SRD in humans. Importantly, these changes include the production of multiple spontaneous detachments without the presence of a retinal tear or significant degeneration of outer segments, changes in the expression of proteins involved in adhesion and fluid transport, and a disrupted organization of RPE tight junctions that may contribute to the formation of focal detachments.",nonCancer
2463,Cetuximab intensifies the ADCC activity of adoptive NK cells in a nude mouse colorectal cancer xenograft model.,"Natural killer (NK) cells, discovered ~40 years ago, are believed to be the most effective cytotoxic lymphocytes to counteract cancer; however, adoptive NK cell therapy in vivo has encountered certain limitations, including a lack of specificity. The drug cetuximab can mediate antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity through NK cells in vivo, and has been approved for the first-line treatment of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-positive metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the ADCC activity of adoptive NK cells, induced by cetuximab in a nude mouse CRC xenograft model, has not been previously reported. The aim of the present study was to explore the ADCC activity of cetuximab combined with adoptive NK cells in CRC xenograft models with various EGFR expressions. The nude mouse xenograft models were established by subcutaneously injecting LOVO or SW620 cells. The mice were then randomly divided into 6 groups: Phosphate-buffered saline, cetuximab, human immunoglobulin G (hIgG), NK cells, hIgG plus NK cells and cetuximab plus NK cells. The ADCC antitumor activity was evaluated in these CRC models. The results indicated that the cetuximab plus NK cells group showed the greatest tumor inhibition effect compared with the NK cells group in LOVO xenograft tumor models with positive EGFR expression. However, the combination of cetuximab and NK cells did not show a stronger tumor inhibitory effect against the SW620 xenograft tumor models compared with the efficiency of NK cells. In conclusion, cetuximab could intensify the ADCC antitumor activity of adoptive NK cells towards CRC with an increased EGFR expression. The combination of cetuximab and NK cells may be a potential immunotherapy for metastatic CRC patients with positive EGFR expression.",nonCancer
969,PDK1-SGK1 Signaling Sustains AKT-Independent mTORC1 Activation and Confers Resistance to PI3Kα Inhibition.,"PIK3CA, which encodes the p110α subunit of PI3K, is frequently mutated and oncogenic in breast cancer. PI3Kα inhibitors are in clinical development and despite promising early clinical activity, intrinsic resistance is frequent among patients. We have previously reported that residual downstream mTORC1 activity upon treatment with PI3Kα inhibitors drives resistance to these agents. However, the mechanism underlying this phenotype is not fully understood. Here we show that in cancer cells resistant to PI3Kα inhibition, PDK1 blockade restores sensitivity to these therapies. SGK1, which is activated by PDK1, contributes to the maintenance of residual mTORC1 activity through direct phosphorylation and inhibition of TSC2. Targeting either PDK1 or SGK1 prevents mTORC1 activation, restoring the antitumoral effects of PI3Kα inhibition in resistant cells.",cancer
1137,PIK3CA mutation associates with improved outcome in breast cancer.,"In breast cancer, somatic mutations in the PIK3CA gene are common. The prognostic implication of these activating mutations remains uncertain as moderately sized studies have yielded variable outcomes. Our aim was to determine the prognostic implications of PIK3CA mutations in breast cancer. Archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded primary breast tumors, from 590 patients selected for known vital status with a median follow-up of 12.8 years and a tumor >1 cm, were genotyped for PIK3CA mutations. Mutation rates and associations between mutation site and clinicopathologic characteristics were assessed. Progression-free survival, overall survival, and breast cancer-specific survival were examined using Kaplan-Meier or competing risk methodology. PIK3CA mutation is identified in 32.5% of breast cancers. PIK3CA mutation significantly associates with older age at diagnosis, hormone receptor positivity, HER2 negativity, lower tumor grade and stage, and lymph node negativity. Patients with PIK3CA mutated tumors have significant improvement in overall survival (P = 0.03) and breast cancer-specific survival (P = 0.004). Analysis for PIK3CA mutation site-specific associations reveals that the H1047R kinase domain mutation highly associates with node negativity (P = 0.007), whereas helical domain hotspot mutations associate with older age at diagnosis (P = 0.004). This study defines the positive prognostic significance of PIK3CA mutations. This work is clinically relevant, as it will significantly affect the design of clinical trials planned for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-targeted therapy. Future work may define a population of older age breast cancer patients in whom therapy can be minimized.",cancer
595,Diagnostic gold standard for soft tissue tumours: morphology or molecular genetics?,"The recognition of recurrent genetic alterations in specific tumour types has provided the basis for the reclassification of certain soft tissue neoplasms, and molecular analysis of patient material has the potential to provide both diagnostic and prognostic information. In this review, we evaluate the role of molecular genetic testing as the prospective 'gold standard' for sarcoma diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing, as with every new method, promises to improve accuracy and to be more sensitive and less subjective, claims that have been made previously by histochemistry, electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. Technical limitations in molecular assays, as well as more general specificity issues, decrease the clinical usefulness of molecular pathological testing significantly and suggest that, at present, molecular evaluation is best considered an ancillary technique that neither supersedes other ancillary techniques nor eclipses traditional pathological examination.",cancer
340,Gene expression markers of efficacy and resistance to cetuximab treatment in metastatic colorectal cancer: results from CALGB 80203 (Alliance).,"Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples from CALGB 80203 were analyzed for expression of EGFR axis-related genes to identify prognostic or predictive biomarkers for cetuximab treatment. Patients (238 total) with first-line metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) were randomized to FOLFOX or FOLFIRI chemotherapy ± cetuximab. qRT-PCR analyses were conducted on tissues from 103 patients at baseline to measure gene expression levels of HER-related genes, including amphiregulin (AREG), betacellulin (BTC), NT5E (CD73), DUSP4, EGF, EGFR, epigen (EPGN), epiregulin (EREG), HBEGF, ERBB2 (HER2), ERBB3 (HER3), ERBB4 (HER4), PHLDA1, and TGFA. The interactions between expression levels and treatment with respect to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were modeled using multiplicative Cox proportional hazards models. High tumor mRNA levels of HER2 [hazard ratio (HR), 0.64; P = 0.002] and EREG (HR, 0.89; P = 0.016) were prognostic markers associated with longer PFS across all patients. HER3 and CD73 expression levels were identified as potential predictive markers of benefit from cetuximab. In KRAS wild-type (WT) tumors, low HER3 expression was associated with longer OS from cetuximab treatment, whereas high HER3 expression was associated with shorter OS from cetuximab treatment (chemo + cetuximab: HR, 1.15; chemo-only: HR, 0.48; Pinteraction = 0.029). High CD73 expression was associated with longer PFS from cetuximab treatment in patients with KRAS-WT (chemo + cetuximab: HR, 0.91; chemo-only: HR, 1.57; Pinteraction = 0.026) and KRAS-mutant (Mut) tumors (chemo + cetuximab: HR, 0.80; chemo-only: HR, 1.29; P = 0.025). Gene expression of HER3 and CD73 was identified as a potential predictive marker for cetuximab. These data implicate HER axis signaling and immune modulation as potential mechanisms of cetuximab action and sensitivity.",cancer
939,Detailed imaging and genetic analysis reveal a secondary BRAF(L505H) resistance mutation and extensive intrapatient heterogeneity in metastatic BRAF mutant melanoma patients treated with vemurafenib.,"Resistance to treatment is the main problem of targeted treatment for cancer. We followed ten patients during treatment with vemurafenib, by three-dimensional imaging. In all patients, only a subset of lesions progressed. Next-generation DNA sequencing was performed on sequential biopsies in four patients to uncover mechanisms of resistance. In two patients, we identified mutations that explained resistance to vemurafenib; one of these patients had a secondary BRAF L505H mutation. This is the first observation of a secondary BRAF mutation in a vemurafenib-resistant patient-derived melanoma sample, which confirms the potential importance of the BRAF L505H mutation in the development of therapy resistance. Moreover, this study hints toward an important role for tumor heterogeneity in determining the outcome of targeted treatments.",cancer
905,Genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway confer sensitivity of thyroid cancer cells to therapeutic targeting of Akt and mammalian target of rapamycin.,"We investigated the genotype-dependent therapeutic potential of targeting the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway for thyroid cancer. Proliferation of TPC1, Hth7, FTC133, OCUT1, K1, and BCPAP cells that harbored PI3K/Akt-activating genetic alterations was potently inhibited by the Akt inhibitor perifosine, whereas SW1736, Hth74, WRO, KAT18, and TAD2 cells that harbored no genetic alterations had no or only modest responses. Inhibition of Akt phosphorylation by perifosine was seen in these cells. Genetic-dependent apoptosis was induced by perifosine in cells selectively tested. Similarly, potent inhibition of cell proliferation by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor temsirolimus occurred in virtually all the cells harboring genetic alterations, whereas modest inhibition was seen in some of the cells not harboring genetic alterations. Temsirolimus inhibited the phosphorylation of p70S6K, a substrate of mTOR. Knockdown of Akt1/2 or mTOR by shRNA approach inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of FTC133 and OCUT1 cells that harbored genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway but had no effect on SW1736 and KAT18 cells that did not. Transfection with PIK3CA mutants greatly sensitized SW1736 cells to perifosine and temsirolimus. Growth of xenograft tumors derived from FTC133 cells but not SW1736 cells in nude mice was dramatically inhibited by perifosine. Thus, this work for the first time shows that genetic alterations in the PI3K/Akt pathway confer thyroid cancer cells addiction to this pathway and their sensitivity to inhibition by targeting Akt and mTOR. This genotype-based targeting of the PI3K/Akt pathway using Akt and mTOR inhibitors may offer an effective therapeutic strategy for thyroid cancer and warrants further studies.",cancer
730,High SIRT1 expression is a negative prognosticator in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that Sirt1, a class III histone deacetylase (HDAC) is implicated in the initiation and progression of malignancies and thus gained attraction as druggable target. Since data on the role of Sirt1 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) are sparse, we investigated the expression profile and prognostic significance of Sirt1 in vivo as well as cellular effects of Sirt1 inhibition in vitro. Sirt1 expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in a large cohort of PDACs and correlated with clinicopathological and survival data. Furthermore, we investigated the impact of overexpression and small molecule inhibition on Sirt1 in pancreatic cancer cell culture models including combinatorial treatment with chemotherapy and EGFR-inhibition. Cellular events were measured quantitatively in real time and corroborated by conventional readouts including FACS analysis and MTT assays. We detected nuclear Sirt1 expression in 36 (27.9%) of 129 PDACs. SIRT1 expression was significantly higher in poorly differentiated carcinomas. Strong SIRT1 expression was a significant predictor of poor survival both in univariate (p = 0.002) and multivariate (HR 1.65, p = 0.045) analysis. Accordingly, overexpression of Sirt1 led to increased cell viability, while small molecule inhibition led to a growth arrest in pancreatic cancer cells and impaired cell survival. This effect was even more pronounced in combinatorial regimens with gefitinib, but not in combination with gemcitabine. Sirt1 is an independent prognosticator in PDACs and plays an important role in pancreatic cancer cell growth, which can be levered out by small molecule inhibition. Our data warrant further studies on SIRT1 as a novel chemotherapeutic target in PDAC.",cancer
266,IDH2 mutations are frequent in angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma.,"Mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) occur in most grade 2 and 3 gliomas, secondary glioblastomas, and a subset of acute myelogenous leukemias but have not been detected in other tumor types. The mutations occur at specific arginine residues and result in the acquisition of a novel enzymatic activity that converts 2-oxoglutarate to D-2-hydroxyglutarate. This study reports IDH1 and IDH2 genotyping results from a set of lymphomas, which included a large set of peripheral T-cell lymphomas. IDH2 mutations were identified in approximately 20% of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas (AITLs), but not in other peripheral T-cell lymphoma entities. These results were confirmed in an independent set of AITL patients, where the IDH2 mutation rate was approximately 45%. This is the second common genetic lesion identified in AITL after TET2 and extends the number of neoplastic diseases where IDH1 and IDH2 mutations may play a role.",cancer
1047,"Germline mutations in ETV6 are associated with thrombocytopenia, red cell macrocytosis and predisposition to lymphoblastic leukemia.","Some familial platelet disorders are associated with predisposition to leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or dyserythropoietic anemia. We identified a family with autosomal dominant thrombocytopenia, high erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and two occurrences of B cell-precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous single-nucleotide change in ETV6 (ets variant 6), c.641C>T, encoding a p.Pro214Leu substitution in the central domain, segregating with thrombocytopenia and elevated MCV. A screen of 23 families with similar phenotypes identified 2 with ETV6 mutations. One family also had a mutation encoding p.Pro214Leu and one individual with ALL. The other family had a c.1252A>G transition producing a p.Arg418Gly substitution in the DNA-binding domain, with alternative splicing and exon skipping. Functional characterization of these mutations showed aberrant cellular localization of mutant and endogenous ETV6, decreased transcriptional repression and altered megakaryocyte maturation. Our findings underscore a key role for ETV6 in platelet formation and leukemia predisposition.",cancer
1176,A phase II randomized trial evaluating gefitinib intercalated with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy or pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy alone in unselected patients with advanced non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.,"Current pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy does not produce a satisfactory therapeutic response in advanced lung cancer patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether the administration of gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), intercalated with pemetrexed/platinum could improve the efficacy in chemotherapy-naïve patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC without subsequent gefitinib maintenance therapy. Treatment-naïve patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed (500 mg/m (2) d1) and either cisplatin (75 mg/m (2) d1) or carboplatin (AUC = 5 d1) plus gefitinib (250 mg/d on days 3 to 16 of a 3-week cycle) (PC-G) or pemetrexed-platinum (PC) alone. Randomization was stratified according to the tobacco smoking status and EGFR mutational status of the patients. The primary endpoint was the non-progression rate (NPR) at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall response rate (ORR), overall survival (OS), and biosafety. The NPR at 12 weeks was 84.5% for the PC-G treatment arm and 83.1% for the PC treatment arm (P = 0.87). Median PFS was 7.9 months for the PC-G arm and 7.0 months for the PC arm (P = 0.57). The ORR was 50.0% for the PC-G arm and 47.4% for the PC arm (P = 0.78). Median survival was 25.4 mo for the PC-G arm and 20.8 mo for the PC arm (P = 0.54). The incidence of adverse events was similar between the two treatment arms, except for a higher incidence of skin rash with PC-G. Predefined subgroup analyses demonstrated that PC-G significantly increased the PFS compared with the PC regimen in patients with EGFR mutations (P = 0.017). Although gefitinib intercalated with pemetrexed/platinum chemotherapy did not improve the NPR at 12 weeks compared with chemotherapy, an improvement in the PFS for the intercalated treatment arm was seen in the subgroup of patients with EGFR mutations.",cancer
222,Prognostic value of epidermal growth factor receptor in patients with glioblastoma multiforme.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) frequently involves amplification and alteration of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene, resulting in overexpression of varied mutations, including the most common mutation, EGFRvIII, as well as wild-type EGFR (EGFRwt). To test the prognostic value of EGFR, we retrospectively analyzed the relationship between treatment outcomes and the EGFR gene in 87 newly diagnosed adult patients with supratentorial GBM enrolled in clinical trials. The EGFR gene status was assessed by Southern blots and EGFR expression by immunohistochemistry using three monoclonal antibodies (EGFR.25 for EGFR, EGFR.113 for EGFRwt, and DH8.3 for EGFRvIII). EGFR amplification was detected in 40 (46%) of the 87 GBM patients; in 39 (97.5%) of these, EGFR was overexpressed. On the other hand, in 46 of 47 patients without EGFR amplification (97.9%), no EGFR overexpression was present. There was a close correlation between EGFR amplification and EGFR overexpression (P < 0.0001). EGFRwt was overexpressed in 27 of the 40 (67.5%) patients with, and in none without, EGFR amplification (P < 0.0001). Similarly, EGFRvIII was overexpressed in 18 (45.0%) of 40 patients with and in 4 (8.5%) of 47 patients without EGFR amplification (P < 0.0001). The finding that 8 (20%) of the patients with EGFR amplification/EGFR overexpression manifested overexpression of neither EGFRwt nor EGFRvIII indicates that they overexpressed other types of EGFR. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that EGFR amplification was an independent, significant, unfavorable predictor for overall survival (OS) in all patients (P = 0.038, HR = 1.67). With respect to the relationship of age to EGFR prognostication, the EGFR gene status was a more significant prognosticator in younger patients, particularly in those <60 years (P = 0.0003, HR = 3.15), whereas not so in older patients. EGFRvIII overexpression, on the other hand, was not predictive for OS. However, in patients with EGFR amplification, multivariate analysis revealed that EGFRvIII overexpression was an independent, significant, poor prognostic factor for OS (P = 0.0044, HR = 2.71). This finding indicates that EGFRvIII overexpression in the presence of EGFR amplification is the strongest indicator of a poor survival prognosis. In GBM patients, EGFR is of significant prognostic value for predicting survival, and the overexpression of EGFRvIII with amplification plays an important role in enhanced tumorigenicity.",cancer
59,Nucleophosmin gene mutations are predictors of favorable prognosis in acute myelogenous leukemia with a normal karyotype.,"Nucleophosmin (NPM1) exon-12 gene mutations are the hallmark of a large acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) subgroup with normal karyotype, but their prognostic value in this AML subset has not yet been determined. We screened 401 AML patients with normal karyotype treated within the German AML Cooperative Group Protocol 99 (AMLCG99) study for NPM1 mutations. Results were related with partial tandem duplications within the MLL gene (MLL-PTD), Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3-length mutations (FLT3-LM), the tyrosine kinase domain of FLT3 (FLT3-TKD), NRAS, KIT, and CEBPA mutations and with clinical characteristics and outcome. NPM1 mutations were detected in 212 (52.9%) of 401 patients. Fourteen mutations, including 8 new variants, were identified. NPM1-mutated cases associated frequently with FLT3 mutations but rarely with other mutations. The NPM1-mutated group had a higher complete remission (CR) rate (70.5% vs 54.7%, P = .003), a trend to a longer overall survival (OS; median 1012 vs 549 days, P = .076), and significantly longer event-free survival (EFS; median 428 vs 336 days; P = .012). The favorable impact of NPM1 mutations on OS and EFS clearly emerged in the large group (264 [66.8%] of 395 cases) of normal-karyotype AML without FLT3-LM. This positive effect was lost in the presence of a concomitant FLT3-LM, since survival of the NPM1+/FLT3-LM+ double positive was similar to NPM1-/FLT3-LM+ cases. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that NPM1+/FLT3-LM- mutations are an independent predictor for a favorable outcome in AML with normal karyotype.",cancer
459,Molecular determinants of outcome with mammalian target of rapamycin inhibition in endometrial cancer.,"Targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is of increasing interest as a therapeutic strategy in many tumors. The aim of this study was to identify molecular markers associated with mTOR inhibitor activity in women with metastatic endometrial cancer. Archival tumor samples were collected from 94 women with recurrent or metastatic endometrial cancer who participated in 3 National Cancer Insitute of Canada Clinical Trials Group phase 2 trials investigating single-agent mTOR inhibitors: IND160A and IND160B (temsirolimus) and IND192 (ridaforolimus). Analyses included mutational profiling using the OncoCarta Panel version 1.0 and immunohistochemical expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue) and stathmin, a marker of PI3K activation. Associations between biomarker results and clinical outcomes were assessed. Mutations were found in 32 of 73 analyzed tumors, PIK3CA (21 patients) was the most common mutated gene. Co-mutations were seen in 8 tumors, most frequently KRAS and PIK3CA (4 cases). PTEN loss was observed in 46 of 85 samples analyzed and increased stathmin expression was observed in 15 of 65 analyzed samples. No correlation was observed between biomarkers and response or progression. In patients taking concurrent metformin, there was a trend toward lower progression, of 11.8% versus 32.5% (P = .14). No predictive biomarker or combination of biomarkers for mTOR inhibitor activity were identified in this study. Restriction and enrichment of study entry, especially based on archival tumor tissue, should be undertaken with caution in trials using these agents.",cancer
1156,BRAF mutation predicts sensitivity to MEK inhibition.,"The kinase pathway comprising RAS, RAF, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) is activated in most human tumours, often through gain-of-function mutations of RAS and RAF family members. Using small-molecule inhibitors of MEK and an integrated genetic and pharmacologic analysis, we find that mutation of BRAF is associated with enhanced and selective sensitivity to MEK inhibition when compared to either 'wild-type' cells or cells harbouring a RAS mutation. This MEK dependency was observed in BRAF mutant cells regardless of tissue lineage, and correlated with both downregulation of cyclin D1 protein expression and the induction of G1 arrest. Pharmacological MEK inhibition completely abrogated tumour growth in BRAF mutant xenografts, whereas RAS mutant tumours were only partially inhibited. These data suggest an exquisite dependency on MEK activity in BRAF mutant tumours, and offer a rational therapeutic strategy for this genetically defined tumour subtype.",cancer
1905,"Online Survey of US Dermatologists' Sunscreen Opinions: Perceptions, Recommendation Factors, and Self-Usage.","The American Academy of Dermatology and dermatologists' themselves, have recommended public education and patient counseling regarding sunscreen. The purpose of this study was to determine US dermatologists' actual sunscreen perceptions as well as their recommendations and personal usage. 540 practicing US dermatologists responded to an online survey that assessed each physician's perception of safety and efficacy of sunscreen, recommendation factors, and personal usage. Dermatologists have an overall positive view of sunscreen. 99% of dermatologists agree that regular sunscreen use helps lower skin cancer risk, reduces subsequent photoaging, and recommend their family/friends use sunscreen. Most dermatologists believe that oxybenzone and retinyl palmitate are safe in sunscreen (86% and 85%, respectively). Dermatologists used multiple sunscreen recommendation criteria including Sun Protection Factor (SPF) level, broad spectrum protection, cosmetic elegance/feel, and photostability (96%, 98%, 85%, and 68%, respectively). The use of sunscreen remains a critical part of sun protection. Therefore, it is important to assess and understand the perspective and patient recommendations provided by dermatologists. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1121-1123.",nonCancer
1333,Changing Epidemiology of Hepatitis C Virus Genotype among Patients with Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Hepatitis C Virus Co-Infection in China.,"Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has become the most common cause of death in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients on antiretroviral therapy. The distribution of HCV genotypes varies with geographical regions and time, and limited studies have focused on the HCV genotype in HIV/HCV co-infection.|The distribution of HCV genotypes was evaluated in 414 patients with HIV/HCV co-infection in three regions (South, Central and Northwest) of China from 2008 to 2010. The NS5B region of HCV was characterized using nested reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Nucleotide sequences obtained were subjected to phylogenetic analysis, and genotypes were assigned using published reference genotypes.|Genotype 3 was the most prevalent HCV strain (36.2%), followed by genotype 6 (30.0%), genotype 1 (28.5%), genotype 2 (5.1%), and genotype 5 (0.2%). The distribution varied geographically. Genotype 6 (37.6%) was the predominant strain while genotype 1 (20.2%) was less common in the South compared to the Central and Northwest regions (all P < 0.001). The distribution also varied temporally. There was no significant difference in genotype distribution in Guangdong (a province in the South region), between patient cohorts from 2005-2008 and 2009-2010. However, outside Guangdong, genotypes 3 and 6a became significantly more prevalent (22.4% vs.42.2%, P< 0.001; 8.0% vs. 19.8%, P = 0.004), and genotype 1 less prevalent (54.4% vs.26.6%, P< 0.001) over time.|The most dramatic shift in genotypic distribution was the movement of HCV genotypes 3 and 6a outside of Guangdong in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. This movement appeared closely associated with transmission via injected drug use.",nonCancer
618,Treatment outcome of all-trans retinoic acid/anthracycline combination chemotherapy and the prognostic impact of FLT3/ITD mutation in acute promyelocytic leukemia patients.,"All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)/anthracycline chemotherapy is beneficial in newly diagnosed acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL); however, it is important to identify patients with high-risk disease to increase the cure rate. We investigated the outcome of ATRA/anthracycline chemotherapy and clinicobiological correlations of FLT3/ITD and NPM1 mutations in APL patients. Induction therapy included oral ATRA (45 mg/m(2)/day) and idarubicin (12 mg/m(2)/day, intravenous, on days 2, 4, and 6). Patients achieving complete remission (CR) received 3 courses of ATRA combined with reinforced consolidation therapy. Mutations were analyzed using GeneScan and polymerasae chain reaction assays of bone marrow samples obtained from patients at diagnosis. Forty-five (84.9%) of 53 eligible patients achieved CR. The overall relapse rate was 8.9%, and the 3-year overall survival (OS) and leukemia-free survival (LFS) were 84.9±4.9% and 77.5±6.0%, respectively. The NPM1 mutation was not found in any patient, while the FLT3/ITD mutation was found in 10 (20.0%) patients. Of the FLT3/ITD+ patients, 80% belonged to the high-risk group, defined according to the presenting WBC and platelet counts. Among the patients who achieved CR, those who were FLT3/ITD+ had a higher relapse rate than those FLT3/ITD-. FLT3/ITD+ patients also had a significantly lower 3-year LFS than FLT3/ITD- patients. Multivariate analysis of the LFS showed that the FLT3/ITD mutation was independently associated with a shorter overall LFS, after adjusting for pretreatment risk stratification. This study investigated the clinical outcome of newly diagnosed APL patients treated with ATRA/anthracycline chemotherapy. Patients carrying the FLT3/ITD mutation had more aggressive clinical features and a poorer clinical outcome.",cancer
1666,Successful repair of recurrent rectovaginal fistula by stratified suture using transanal endoscopic microsurgery: A CARE-compliant case report.,"Rectovaginal fistulas (RVFs) are abnormal connections between the rectum and vagina. Although many surgical approaches to correct them have been attempted, management of RVFs still remains a challenge, especially for recurrent RVFs.|In the present study, we report a case in a 22-year-old female with a chief complaint of obvious passages of flatus or stool through the vagina for 10 years. She had suffered a vaginal trauma from a violent accident 10 years prior, and gradually noticed the uncontrollable passage of gas or feces from the vagina 2 weeks later.The patient underwent a transvaginal direct repair surgery at local hospital 9 years ago, but the symptoms recurred 1 month after the surgery. After 2-years monitoring, the patient underwent another transvaginal repair surgery (fistulectomy followed by direct suture) at another hospital, but the fistula recurred again. We initially performed a temporary protective transversostomy upon admission. After 8-months of observation, a methylene blue test was conducted and the diagnosis of recurrent RVF was confirmed. Subsequently, we performed a successful repair by stratified suture using transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). The scar tissue on the posterior wall of the vagina and the anterior wall of the rectum were meticulously excised until the margin of the excisional line showed healthy tissue. In addition, the fistulous tract was completely removed. The edges of the fistula on the posterior wall of the vagina were closed by simple continuous suturing, and the rectal anterior wall was sutured in the same manner.|During a 1-year follow-up period, the fistulae were not recurrent and no complication such as incontinences or rectal bleeding were found. The latest Wexner score was 3.|We present a case of successful treatment with stratified suture using TEM throughout the procedure. We strongly recommend this efficient and minimally invasive procedure for recurrent RVFs.",nonCancer
202,"Next-generation sequencing of acute myeloid leukemia identifies the significance of TP53, U2AF1, ASXL1, and TET2 mutations.","We assessed the frequency and clinicopathologic significance of 19 genes currently identified as significantly mutated in myeloid neoplasms, RUNX1, ASXL1, TET2, CEBPA, IDH1, IDH2, DNMT3A, FLT3, NPM1, TP53, NRAS, EZH2, CBL, U2AF1, SF3B1, SRSF2, JAK2, CSF3R, and SETBP1, across 93 cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) using capture target enrichment and next-generation sequencing. Of these cases, 79% showed at least one nonsynonymous mutation, and cases of AML with recurrent genetic abnormalities showed a lower frequency of mutations versus AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (P<0.001). Mutational analysis further demonstrated that TP53 mutations are associated with complex karyotype AML, whereas ASXL1 and U2AF1 mutations are associated with AML with myelodysplasia-related changes. Furthermore, U2AF1 mutations were specifically associated with trilineage morphologic dysplasia. Univariate analysis demonstrated that U2AF1 and TP53 mutations are associated with absence of clinical remission, poor overall survival (OS), and poor disease-free survival (DFS; P<0.0001), whereas TET2 and ASXL1 mutations are associated with poor OS (P<0.03). In multivariate analysis, U2AF1 and TP53 mutations retained independent prognostic significance in OS and DFS, respectively. Our results demonstrate unique relationships between mutations in AML, clinicopathologic prognosis, subtype categorization, and morphologic dysplasia.",cancer
1279,Noninvasive mapping of endothelial dysfunction in myocardial ischemia by magnetic resonance imaging using an albumin-based contrast agent.,"Noninvasive preclinical methods for the characterization of myocardial vascular function are crucial to an understanding of the dynamics of ischemic cardiac disease. Ischemic heart disease is associated with myocardial endothelial dysfunction, resulting in leakage of plasma albumin into the extravascular space. These features can be harnessed in a novel noninvasive three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging method to measure fractional blood volume (fBV) and vascular permeability (permeability-surface area product, PS) using labeled albumin as a blood pool contrast agent. C57BL/6 mice were imaged before and 3 days after myocardial infarction (MI). Following the quantification of endogenous myocardial R1 , the dynamics of intravenously injected albumin-based contrast agent, extravasating from permeable myocardial blood vessels, were tracked on short-axis magnetic resonance images of the entire heart. This study successfully discriminated between infarcted and remote regions at 3 days post-infarct, based on a reduced fBV and increased PS in the infarcted region. These findings were confirmed using ex vivo fluorescence imaging and histology. We have demonstrated a novel method to quantify blood volume and permeability in the infarcted myocardium, providing an imaging biomarker for the assessment of endothelial dysfunction. This method has the potential to three-dimensionally visualize subtle changes in myocardial permeability and to track endothelial function for longitudinal cardiac studies determining pathophysiological processes during infarct healing.",nonCancer

1067,Genomic sequencing of meningiomas identifies oncogenic SMO and AKT1 mutations.,"Meningiomas are the most common primary nervous system tumor. The tumor suppressor NF2 is disrupted in approximately half of all meningiomas, but the complete spectrum of genetic changes remains undefined. We performed whole-genome or whole-exome sequencing on 17 meningiomas and focused sequencing on an additional 48 tumors to identify and validate somatic genetic alterations. Most meningiomas had simple genomes, with fewer mutations, rearrangements and copy-number alterations than reported in other tumors in adults. However, several meningiomas harbored more complex patterns of copy-number changes and rearrangements, including one tumor with chromothripsis. We confirmed focal NF2 inactivation in 43% of tumors and found alterations in epigenetic modifiers in an additional 8% of tumors. A subset of meningiomas lacking NF2 alterations harbored recurrent oncogenic mutations in AKT1 (p.Glu17Lys) and SMO (p.Trp535Leu) and exhibited immunohistochemical evidence of activation of these pathways. These mutations were present in therapeutically challenging tumors of the skull base and higher grade. These results begin to define the spectrum of genetic alterations in meningiomas and identify potential therapeutic targets.",cancer

The obtained CuP2 nanowires have high aspect ratio and exhibit single crystal structure of monoclinic CuP2 without other impurity phase. CuP2 nanowires have progressive improvement for semiconductors and energy storages compared with bulk CuP2. Being utilized for back-gate field effect transistor (FET) measurement, CuP2 nanowires possess a p-type behavior intrinsically with on/off ratio larger than 104 and its single nanowire electrical transport property exhibits a hole mobility of 147 cm2 V-1 s-1 , which represent the example of CuP2 transistor. In addition, CuP2 nanowires can serve as a appealing anode material for lithium-ion batteries electrode. The discharge capacity maintained 945 mA h g-1 after 100 cycles, showing good capacity retention of 88 % based on the first discharge capacity. Even at high rate 6 C, the electrode still exhibited an outstanding result with capacity of ~600 mA h g-1. Ex-situ TEM and CV tests demonstrate that the stability of capacity retention and remarkable rate capability of CuP2 nanowires electrode are attributed to the role of metal phosphide conversion type lithium storage mechanism. Finally, CuP2 nanowire anodes and LiFePO4 cathodes were assembled into pouch-type lithium batteries offering a cpapcity over 60 mA h.

948,HER2 gene copy number status may influence clinical efficacy to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.,"In metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), KRAS is the only validated biomarker used to select patients for administration of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-targeted therapies. To identify additional predictive markers, we investigated the importance of HER2, the primary EGFR dimerisation partner, in this particular disease. We evaluated the HER2 gene status by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in 170 KRAS wild-type mCRC patients treated with cetuximab or panitumumab. Depending on HER2 gene copy number status, patients showed three distinct cytogenetic profiles: 4% of patients had HER2 gene amplification (R:HER2/CEP17 ≥ 2) in all neoplastic cells (HER2-all-A), 61% of patients had HER2 gain due to polysomy or to gene amplification in minor clones (HER2-FISH+*), and 35% of patients had no or slight HER2 gain (HER2-FISH-). These subgroups were significantly correlated with different clinical behaviours, in terms of response rate (RR; P=0.0006), progression-free survival (PFS; P<0.0001) and overall survival (OS; P<0.0001). Patients with HER2-all-A profile experienced the worst outcome, patients with HER2-FISH- profile showed an intermediate behaviour and patients with HER2-FISH+* profile were related to the highest survival probability (median PFS in months: 2.5 vs 3.9 vs 7.6, respectively; median OS in months: 4.2 vs 9.7 vs 13, respectively). HER2 gene copy number status may influence the clinical response to anti-EGFR-targeted therapy in mCRC patients.",cancer

Evidence suggests that up to 0.5% of anticoagulated patients suffer from ICH annually. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become an increasingly popular alternative to warfarin for anticoagulation, however, there is a dearth of research regarding the safety of DOACs, in particular on the outcome of traumatic ICH while taking DOACs.|We queried our Trauma Quality Improvement Project registry for patients who presented with traumatic intracranial hemorrhage during anticoagulant use. Patients were grouped into those prescribed warfarin and patients prescribed DOAC medications. The groups were compared with respect to age, gender, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) on arrival, Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) (head), Injury Severity Score (ISS), mortality, need for operative intervention, hospital and ICU lengths of stay, proportion of patients transfused (and their transfusion requirements), and rates of discharge to skilled nursing facility. Poisson regression was conducted to determine the relationship between mortality and treatment group while controlling for covariates (comorbidities, ISS).|There were no differences between DOAC and warfarin groups in terms of age, gender, median ISS, median AIS head, or median admission GCS. Mechanisms of injury, median hospital and ICU lengths of stay, ICU free days, and transfusion requirements were also not significantly different.DOAC use was associated with significantly lower mortality (4.9% vs. 20.8%; p<0.008), and a lower rate of operative intervention (8.2% vs. 26.7%; p=0.023) when compared with warfarin. Excluding patients who died, the observed rate of discharge to skilled nursing facility was lower in the DOAC group (28.8% compared with 39.7%; p=0.03). Multivariate Poisson regression analysis demonstrated that warfarin use was associated with an increased mortality when controlling for injury severity, and comorbidities.|We report improved mortality and reduced rates of operative intervention in patients with traumatic ICH associated with DOACs compared with a similar group taking warfarin.

1947,"Patient-Reported Roles, Preferences, and Expectations Regarding Treatment of Stage I Rectal Cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium.","Historically, stage I rectal cancer was treated with total mesorectal excision. However, there has been growing use of local excision, with and without adjuvant therapy, to treat these early rectal cancers. Little is known about how patients and providers choose among the various treatment approaches.|The purpose of this study was to identify patient roles, preferences, and expectations as they relate to treatment decision making for patients with stage I rectal cancer.|This is a population-based study.|The study included a geographically diverse population and health-system-based cohort.|A total of 154 adults with newly diagnosed and surgically treated stage I rectal cancer between 2003 and 2005 were included.|We compared patients by surgical treatment groups, including total mesorectal excision and local excision. Clinical, sociodemographic, and health-system factors were assessed for association with patient decision-making preferences and expectations.|A total of 80% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision versus 63% of patients who underwent local excision expected that surgery would be curative (p = 0.04). The total mesorectal excision group was less likely to report that radiation would cure their cancer compared with the local excision group (27% vs 63%; p = 0.004). When asked about their preferred role in decision making, 28% of patients who underwent total mesorectal excision preferred patient-controlled decision making compared with 48% of patients who underwent local excision (p = 0.046). However, with regard to the treatment actually received, 38% of the total mesorectal excision group reported making their own surgical decision compared with 25% of the local excision group (p = 0.18).|The study was limited by its sample size.|The preferred decision-making role for patients did not match the actual decision-making process. Future efforts should focus on bridging the gap between the decision-making process and patient preferences regarding various treatment approaches. This will be particularly important as newer innovative procedures play a more prominent role in the rectal cancer treatment paradigm.",nonCancer
386,"Whole-exome sequencing and clinical interpretation of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples to guide precision cancer medicine.","Translating whole-exome sequencing (WES) for prospective clinical use may have an impact on the care of patients with cancer; however, multiple innovations are necessary for clinical implementation. These include rapid and robust WES of DNA derived from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue, analytical output similar to data from frozen samples and clinical interpretation of WES data for prospective use. Here, we describe a prospective clinical WES platform for archival formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor samples. The platform employs computational methods for effective clinical analysis and interpretation of WES data. When applied retrospectively to 511 exomes, the interpretative framework revealed a 'long tail' of somatic alterations in clinically important genes. Prospective application of this approach identified clinically relevant alterations in 15 out of 16 patients. In one patient, previously undetected findings guided clinical trial enrollment, leading to an objective clinical response. Overall, this methodology may inform the widespread implementation of precision cancer medicine.",cancer
1734,Influence of Carbon Electrode Material on Energy Recovery From Winery Wastewater Using a Dual Chamber Microbial Fuel Cell.,"The aim of this work was to evaluate three carbon materials as anodes in microbial fuel cells (MFC), clarifying their influence on the generation of electricity and on the treatability of winery wastewater, a highly organic-loaded waste. The electrode materials tested were carbon felt, carbon cloth and carbon paper and they were used at the same time as anode and cathode in the tests. The MFC equipped with carbon felt reached the highest voltage and power (72 mV and 420 mW m(-2), respectively), while the lowest values were observed when carbon paper was used as electrode (0.2 mV and 8.37 10(-6) mW m(-2), respectively). COD removal from the wastewater was observed to depend on the electrode material, as well. When carbon felt was used, the MFC showed the highest average organic matter consumption rate (650 mg COD L(-1) d(-1)) whereas by using carbon paper the rate decreased down to 270 mg COD L(-1) d(-1). Therefore, both, the electricity generation and organic matter removal, are strongly related not to the chemical composition of the electrode (which was graphite carbon in the three electrodes) but to its surface features and, consequently, to the amount of biomass adhered to the electrode surface.",nonCancer
1956,Cytochrome C limits oxidative stress and decreases acidosis in a rat model of hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion injury.,"Hemorrhagic shock and reperfusion (HSR) injury leads to a cascade of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial dysfunction, which results in energy failure, cell death and multiple organ dysfunction. Cytochrome c (cyt c) is the final electron carrier in the mitochondrial electron transport chain providing the electrochemical force for ATP production. We sought to determine whether exogenous cyt c administration would improve parameters of organ dysfunction and/or mitochondrial stability in a rat model of HSR.|Male rats were hemorrhaged to a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 33 ± 2.0mmHg for 1 hour prior to resuscitation. Saline or cyt c (0.8mg [HSR-LoCC] or 3.75mg [HSR-HiCC]) was administered (iv) 30 minutes prior to resuscitation. Rats were euthanized by cardiac puncture 2 hours post-surgery and tissue collected and analyzed for lipid peroxidation, endogenous antioxidant activity (glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase), TNF-α expression, mitochondrial function (complex-I activity) and circulating mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA).|Cyt c administration improved lactate clearance, decreased hepatic lipid peroxidation, increased hepatic GPx activity, restored pulmonary TNF-α to sham activity levels and increased hepatic complex-I activity. Furthermore, addition of exogenous cyt c decreased circulating levels of mtDNA CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that cyt c reduces markers of physiologic stress, decreases oxidative stress, and lowers levels of circulating mtDNA. The impact of cytochrome c is organ specific. Further studies remain to determine the sum of the effects of cytochrome c on overall outcome.",nonCancer
541,RAF suppression synergizes with MEK inhibition in KRAS mutant cancer cells.,"KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancer, yet no therapies are available to treat KRAS mutant cancers. We used two independent reverse genetic approaches to identify components of the RAS-signaling pathways required for growth of KRAS mutant tumors. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening of 37 KRAS mutant colorectal cancer cell lines showed that RAF1 suppression was synthetic lethal with MEK inhibition. An unbiased kinome short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based screen confirmed this synthetic lethal interaction in colorectal as well as in lung cancer cells bearing KRAS mutations. Compounds targeting RAF kinases can reverse resistance to the MEK inhibitor selumetinib. MEK inhibition induces RAS activation and BRAF-RAF1 dimerization and sustains MEK-ERK signaling, which is responsible for intrinsic resistance to selumetinib. Prolonged dual blockade of RAF and MEK leads to persistent ERK suppression and efficiently induces apoptosis. Our data underlie the relevance of developing combinatorial regimens of drugs targeting the RAF-MEK pathway in KRAS mutant tumors.",cancer
1127,"Heterogeneity in therapeutic response of genetically altered myeloma cell lines to interleukin 6, dexamethasone, doxorubicin, and melphalan.","Because there is no known genetic abnormality common to all patients with myeloma, it is important to understand how genetic heterogeneity may lead to differences in signal transduction, cell cycle, and response to therapy. Model cell lines have been used to study the effect that mutations in p53 and ras can have on growth properties and responses of myeloma cells. The U266 cell line has a single mutant p53 allele. Stable expression of wild-type (wt) p53 in U266 cells results in a significant suppression of interleukin (IL)-6 gene expression and in the concomitant suppression of cell growth that could be restored by the addition of exogenous IL-6. Expression of wt p53 also leads to cell cycle arrest and protection from doxorubicin (Dox)- and melphalan (Mel)-induced apoptosis. The addition of IL-6 resulted in cell cycle progression and blocked p53-mediated protection from apoptosis. ANBL6 is an IL-6-dependent cell line that is sensitive to dexamethasone (Dex), Dox, and Mel. IL-6 is able to protect ANBL6 cells from Dex- and Mel- but not Dox-induced apoptosis. To study the effect of an activating mutation in ras, the ANBL6 cell line transfected with either a constitutively activated N- or K-ras gene was used. Both N-ras12 and K-ras12 genes were able to protect ANBL6 cells from apoptosis induced by Dex, Dox, and Mel. These data show that changes in ras or p53 can alter the myeloma cell response to IL-6 and demonstrate that the genetic background can alter therapeutic responses.",cancer
1048,Novel germ line DDX41 mutations define families with a lower age of MDS/AML onset and lymphoid malignancies.,"Recently our group and others have identified DDX41 mutations both as germ line and acquired somatic mutations in families with multiple cases of late onset myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (AML), suggesting that DDX41 acts as a tumor suppressor. To determine whether novel DDX41 mutations could be identified in families with additional types of hematologic malignancies, our group screened two cohorts of families with a diverse range of hematologic malignancy subtypes. Among 289 families, we identified nine (3%) with DDX41 mutations. As previously observed, MDS and AML were the most common malignancies, often of the erythroblastic subtype, and 1 family displayed early-onset follicular lymphoma. Five novel mutations were identified, including missense mutations within important functional domains and start-loss and splicing mutations predicted to result in truncated proteins. We also show that most asymptomatic mutation carriers have normal blood counts until malignancy develops. This study expands both the mutation and phenotypic spectra observed in families with germ line DDX41 mutations. With an increasing number of both inherited and acquired mutations in this gene being identified, further study of how DDX41 disruption leads to hematologic malignancies is critical.",cancer
765,Frequent mutation of the PI3K pathway in head and neck cancer defines predictive biomarkers.,"Genomic findings underscore the heterogeneity of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Identification of mutations that predict therapeutic response would be a major advance. We determined the mutationally altered, targetable mitogenic pathways in a large HNSCC cohort. Analysis of whole-exome sequencing data from 151 tumors revealed the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway to be the most frequently mutated oncogenic pathway (30.5%). PI3K pathway-mutated HNSCC tumors harbored a significantly higher rate of mutations in known cancer genes. In a subset of human papillomavirus-positive tumors, PIK3CA or PIK3R1 was the only mutated cancer gene. Strikingly, all tumors with concurrent mutation of multiple PI3K pathway genes were advanced (stage IV), implicating concerted PI3K pathway aberrations in HNSCC progression. Patient-derived tumorgrafts with canonical and noncanonical PIK3CA mutations were sensitive to an mTOR/PI3K inhibitor (BEZ-235), in contrast to PIK3CA-wild-type tumorgrafts. These results suggest that PI3K pathway mutations may serve as predictive biomarkers for treatment selection.",cancer
238,Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor as predictive biomarkers of response to endocrine therapy: a prospectively powered pathology study in the Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational trial.,"The Tamoxifen and Exemestane Adjuvant Multinational (TEAM) trial included a prospectively planned pathology substudy testing the predictive value of progesterone receptor (PgR) expression for outcome of estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) early breast cancer treated with exemestane versus tamoxifen. Pathology blocks from 4,781 TEAM patients randomly assigned to exemestane versus tamoxifen followed by exemestane for 5 years of total therapy were collected centrally, and tissue microarrays were constructed from samples from 4,598 patients. Quantitative analysis of hormone receptors (ER and PgR) was performed by using image analysis and immunohistochemistry, and the results were linked to outcome data from the main TEAM trial and analyzed relative to disease-free survival and treatment. Of 4,325 eligible ER-positive patients, 23% were PgR-poor (Allred < 4) and 77% were PgR- rich (Allred ≥ 5). No treatment-by-marker effect for PgR was observed for exemestane versus tamoxifen (PgR-rich hazard ratio [HR], 0.83; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.05; PgR-poor HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.61 to 1.19; P = .88 for interaction). Both PgR and ER expression were associated with patient prognosis in univariate (PgR HR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.43 to 0.65; P < .001; ER HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.86; P = .002), and multivariate analyses (P < .001 and P = .001, respectively). A trend toward a treatment-by-marker effect for ER-rich patients was observed. Preferential exemestane versus tamoxifen treatment benefit was not predicted by PgR expression; conversely, patients with ER-rich tumors may derive additional benefit from exemestane. Quantitative analysis of ER and PgR expression provides highly significant information on risk of early relapse (within 1 to 3 years) during treatment.",cancer
367,A novel ALK secondary mutation and EGFR signaling cause resistance to ALK kinase inhibitors.,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), including crizotinib, are effective treatments in preclinical models and in cancer patients with ALK-translocated cancers. However, their efficacy will ultimately be limited by the development of acquired drug resistance. Here we report two mechanisms of ALK TKI resistance identified from a crizotinib-treated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patient and in a cell line generated from the resistant tumor (DFCI076) as well as from studying a resistant version of the ALK TKI (TAE684)-sensitive H3122 cell line. The crizotinib-resistant DFCI076 cell line harbored a unique L1152R ALK secondary mutation and was also resistant to the structurally unrelated ALK TKI TAE684. Although the DFCI076 cell line was still partially dependent on ALK for survival, it also contained concurrent coactivation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling. In contrast, the TAE684-resistant (TR3) H3122 cell line did not contain an ALK secondary mutation but instead harbored coactivation of EGFR signaling. Dual inhibition of both ALK and EGFR was the most effective therapeutic strategy for the DFCI076 and H3122 TR3 cell lines. We further identified a subset (3/50; 6%) of treatment naive NSCLC patients with ALK rearrangements that also had concurrent EGFR activating mutations. Our studies identify resistance mechanisms to ALK TKIs mediated by both ALK and by a bypass signaling pathway mediated by EGFR. These mechanisms can occur independently, or in the same cancer, suggesting that the combination of both ALK and EGFR inhibitors may represent an effective therapy for these subsets of NSCLC patients.",cancer

The attendance list of the Emergency Department and Outpatient Clinic of a level-1 trauma center were used. Using a non-weight-bearing anteroposterior-view of the foot the distance between the base of metatarsal 1 and metatarsal 2 (MT1-MT2) and the distance between the medial cuneiform (MC) and the base of metatarsal 2 (MC-MT2) were measured. Median normal values were calculated per age.|A total of 352 patients between the age of 0 and 18 years were screened for eligibility. Excluded were 109 patients because of anatomic abnormality, a fracture, inadequate radiograph, pain at the base of the first metatarsal, second metatarsal or MC, persisting pain at the Outpatient Clinic checkup or no follow-up.

726,A common BIM deletion polymorphism mediates intrinsic resistance and inferior responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in cancer.,"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) elicit high response rates among individuals with kinase-driven malignancies, including chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and epidermal growth factor receptor-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (EGFR NSCLC). However, the extent and duration of these responses are heterogeneous, suggesting the existence of genetic modifiers affecting an individual's response to TKIs. Using paired-end DNA sequencing, we discovered a common intronic deletion polymorphism in the gene encoding BCL2-like 11 (BIM). BIM is a pro-apoptotic member of the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family of proteins, and its upregulation is required for TKIs to induce apoptosis in kinase-driven cancers. The polymorphism switched BIM splicing from exon 4 to exon 3, which resulted in expression of BIM isoforms lacking the pro-apoptotic BCL2-homology domain 3 (BH3). The polymorphism was sufficient to confer intrinsic TKI resistance in CML and EGFR NSCLC cell lines, but this resistance could be overcome with BH3-mimetic drugs. Notably, individuals with CML and EGFR NSCLC harboring the polymorphism experienced significantly inferior responses to TKIs than did individuals without the polymorphism (P = 0.02 for CML and P = 0.027 for EGFR NSCLC). Our results offer an explanation for the heterogeneity of TKI responses across individuals and suggest the possibility of personalizing therapy with BH3 mimetics to overcome BIM-polymorphism-associated TKI resistance.",cancer
2501,Immunoprotection of recombinant Eg.myophilin against Echinococcus granulosus infection in sheep.,"The aims of the present study were to investigate the immunoprotection of recombinant Echinococcus granulosus myophilin (rEg.myophilin) against the establishment of a challenge oral infection with E. granulosus eggs, as well as to determine the mechanisms underlying this protection. Sheep were subcutaneously immunized two times with rEg.myophilin, followed by the challenge with E. granulosus eggs orally. The animals were sacrificed 44 weeks after infection and the immunoglobulin (Ig) and cytokine levels were analyzed using ELISA. The results identified significant changes in several indexes of animal immune response subsequent to immunization with rEg.myophilin. These changes included reduced number of formed cysts, as well as elevated levels of IgG, IgA and cytokines. The present data suggest that immunization with rEg.myophilin in sheep can successfully reduce the formation of cysts caused by challenge E. granulosus infection and stimulate immune response, suggesting that rEg.myophilin a has potential value as a candidate vaccine against E. granulosus.",nonCancer
2414,APC promoter is frequently methylated in pancreatic juice of patients with pancreatic carcinomas or periampullary tumors.,"Early detection of pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms is critical to improve their clinical outcome. The present authors previously demonstrated that DNA hypermethylation of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), histamine receptor H2 (HRH2), cadherin 13 (CDH13), secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich (SPARC) and engrailed-1 (EN-1) promoters is frequently detected in pancreatic tumor cells. The aim of the present study was to assess their prevalence in pancreatic juice of carcinomas of the pancreas and periampullary area. A total of 135 pancreatic juices obtained from 85 pancreatic cancer (PC), 26 ampullary carcinoma (AC), 10 intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and 14 chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients were analyzed. The methylation status of the APC, HRH2, CDH13, SPARC and EN-1 promoters was analyzed using methylation specific-melting curve analysis (MS-MCA). Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) mutations were also tested with allele-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplification. Out of the 5 promoters analyzed, APC (71%) and HRH2 (65%) were the most frequently methylated in PC juice. APC methylation was also detected at a high frequency in AC (76%) and IPMN (80%), but only occasionally observed in CP (7%). APC methylation had a high sensitivity (71-80%) for all types of cancer analyzed. The panel (where a sample scored as positive when ≥2 markers were methylated) did not outperform APC as a single marker. Finally, KRAS detection in pancreatic juice offered a lower sensitivity (50%) and specificity (71%) for detection of any cancer. APC hypermethylation in pancreatic juice, as assessed by MS-MCA, is a frequent event of potential clinical usefulness in the diagnosis of pancreatic and periampullary neoplasms.",nonCancer
867,Colorectal Cancer with BRAF D594G Mutation Is Not Associated with Microsatellite Instability or Poor Prognosis.,"BRAF D594G mutations in colorectal cancer patients are not clearly understood. We retrospectively investigated the clinicopathological features of colorectal cancers with BRAF D594G mutations. We selected 908 colorectal cancer patients who underwent surgical resection from January 2008 to January 2013, and assessed BRAF, KRAS, microsatellite instability, and CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). We detected BRAF D594G in 7 patients and BRAF V600E in 45 patients. The clinicopathological features of cancers with BRAF D594G mutation were similar to those with BRAF wild-type, but differed from those with BRAF V600E mutations. Regarding microsatellite instability status, 44.4% of cases with BRAF V600E mutations exhibited high microsatellite instability, compared to 14.3% of those with BRAF D594G mutations and 4.4% of those with BRAF wild-type. There were no CIMP-positive tumors in cancers with BRAF D594G mutations, whereas 67.8% of tumors with BRAF V600E mutations were CIMP-positive. In stage IV cancers, the survival rates of patients at 2 years were 8.5, 50.0, and 68.2% in the BRAF V600E mutation, BRAF D594G mutation, and BRAF wild-type groups, respectively. Colorectal cancers with BRAF D594G mutations exhibit similar clinicopathological features, microsatellite instability status, and prognosis as those with BRAF wild-type.",cancer
1157,Prognostic and clinicopathologic associations of oncogenic BRAF in metastatic melanoma.,"To assess the frequency and type of oncogenic BRAF mutations in metastatic melanoma and correlate BRAF status with clinicopathologic features and outcome. Consecutive BRAF-tested Australian patients with metastatic melanoma (n = 197) were observed prospectively. A comprehensive range of clinicopathologic variables were correlated with BRAF mutation status, and a survival analysis was conducted. Forty-eight percent of patients had a BRAF mutation; 70 patients (74%) had V600E, 19 (20%) had V600K, and six (6%) had other genotypes. Other than age at diagnosis of distant metastasis (median age, 56 v 63 years for BRAF-mutant v BRAF wild-type patients, respectively; P < .001), there was no significant difference in clinical features of patients with metastatic melanoma by mutation status. Features of the antecedent primary melanoma significantly associated with a BRAF mutation (P < .05) were histopathologic subtype, presence of mitoses, single or occult primary melanoma, truncal location, and age at diagnosis of primary tumor ≤ 50 years. The interval from diagnosis of first-ever melanoma to distant metastasis was not significantly different between BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type patients; however, the median survival of patients with newly diagnosed metastatic melanoma was 5.7 months for BRAF-mutant patients not treated with a BRAF inhibitor, 8.5 months for BRAF wild-type patients, and not reached for BRAF-mutant patients treated with a BRAF inhibitor. V600K mutations comprised 20% of BRAF mutations. Characteristics of the antecedent primary melanoma and age at diagnosis differed in BRAF-mutant and BRAF wild-type patients. The presence of mutant BRAF had no impact on the disease-free interval from diagnosis of first-ever melanoma to first distant metastasis; however, it may have impacted survival thereafter.",cancer
374,"Preclinical Test of Dacomitinib, an Irreversible EGFR Inhibitor, Confirms Its Effectiveness for Glioblastoma.","Glioblastomas (GBM) are devastating tumors in which there has been little clinical improvement in the last decades. New molecularly directed therapies are under development. EGFR is one of the most promising targets, as this receptor is mutated and/or overexpressed in nearly half of the GBMs. However, the results obtained with first-generation tyrosine-kinase inhibitors have been disappointing with no clear predictive markers of tumor response. Here, we have tested the antitumoral efficacy of a second-generation inhibitor, dacomitinib (PF299804, Pfizer), that binds in an irreversible way to the receptor. Our results confirm that dacomitinib has an effect on cell viability, self-renewal, and proliferation in EGFR-amplified ± EGFRvIII GBM cells. Moreover, systemic administration of dacomitinib strongly impaired the in vivo tumor growth rate of these EGFR-amplified cell lines, with a decrease in the expression of stem cell-related markers. However, continuous administration of the compound was required to maintain the antitumor effect. The data presented here confirm that dacomitinib clearly affects receptor signaling in vivo and that its strong antitumoral effect is independent of the presence of mutant receptor isoforms although it could be affected by the PTEN status (as it is less effective in a PTEN-deleted GBM line). Dacomitinib is being tested in second line for EGFR-amplified GBMs. We hope that our results could help to select retrospectively molecular determinants of this response and to implement future trials with dacomitinib (alone or in combination with other inhibitors) in newly diagnosed GBMs.",cancer
1171,Gefitinib or carboplatin-paclitaxel in pulmonary adenocarcinoma.,"Previous, uncontrolled studies have suggested that first-line treatment with gefitinib would be efficacious in selected patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. In this phase 3, open-label study, we randomly assigned previously untreated patients in East Asia who had advanced pulmonary adenocarcinoma and who were nonsmokers or former light smokers to receive gefitinib (250 mg per day) (609 patients) or carboplatin (at a dose calculated to produce an area under the curve of 5 or 6 mg per milliliter per minute) plus paclitaxel (200 mg per square meter of body-surface area) (608 patients). The primary end point was progression-free survival. The 12-month rates of progression-free survival were 24.9% with gefitinib and 6.7% with carboplatin-paclitaxel. The study met its primary objective of showing the noninferiority of gefitinib and also showed its superiority, as compared with carboplatin-paclitaxel, with respect to progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.65 to 0.85; P<0.001). In the subgroup of 261 patients who were positive for the epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received gefitinib than among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.64; P<0.001), whereas in the subgroup of 176 patients who were negative for the mutation, progression-free survival was significantly longer among those who received carboplatin-paclitaxel (hazard ratio for progression or death with gefitinib, 2.85; 95% CI, 2.05 to 3.98; P<0.001). The most common adverse events were rash or acne (in 66.2% of patients) and diarrhea (46.6%) in the gefitinib group and neurotoxic effects (69.9%), neutropenia (67.1%), and alopecia (58.4%) in the carboplatin-paclitaxel group. Gefitinib is superior to carboplatin-paclitaxel as an initial treatment for pulmonary adenocarcinoma among nonsmokers or former light smokers in East Asia. The presence in the tumor of a mutation of the EGFR gene is a strong predictor of a better outcome with gefitinib. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00322452.)",cancer
405,Meta-analysis of BRAF mutation as a predictive biomarker of benefit from anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody therapy for RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer.,"Metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) that harbours a BRAF V600E mutation (BRAF MT) is associated with poorer outcomes. However, whether this mutation is predictive of treatment benefit from anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is uncertain. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published up to July 2014 that evaluated the effect of BRAF MT on the treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC. Seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of overall survival (OS), whereas eight RCTs met the inclusion criteria for assessment of progression-free survival (PFS). For RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours, the hazard ratio for OS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs was 0.97 (95% CI; 0.67-1.41), whereas the hazard ratio was 0.81 (95% CI; 0.70-0.95) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours. However, the test of interaction (P=0.43) was not statistically significant, highlighting that the observed differences in the effect of anti-EGFR mAbs on OS according to the BRAF mutation status may be due to chance alone. Regarding PFS benefit with anti-EGFR mAbs, the hazard ratio was 0.86 (95% CI; 0.61-1.21) for RAS WT/BRAF MT tumours as compared with 0.62 (95% CI; 0.50-0.77) for RAS WT/BRAF WT tumours (test of interaction, P=0.07). This meta-analysis demonstrates that there is insufficient evidence to definitively state that RAS WT/BRAF MT individuals attain a different treatment benefit from anti-EGFR mAbs for mCRC compared with RAS WT/BRAF WT individuals. As such, there are insufficient data to justify the exclusion of anti-EGFR mAb therapy for patients with RAS WT/BRAF MT mCRC.",cancer
823,"PTEN activation contributes to tumor inhibition by trastuzumab, and loss of PTEN predicts trastuzumab resistance in patients.","The ErbB2-targeting antibody, trastuzumab (Herceptin), has remarkable therapeutic efficacy in certain patients with ErbB2-overexpressing tumors. The overall trastuzumab response rate, however, is limited and what determines trastuzumab response is poorly understood. Here we report that PTEN activation contributes to trastuzumab's antitumor activity. Trastuzumab treatment quickly increased PTEN membrane localization and phosphatase activity by reducing PTEN tyrosine phosphorylation via Src inhibition. Reducing PTEN in breast cancer cells by antisense oligonucleotides conferred trastuzumab resistance in vitro and in vivo. Patients with PTEN-deficient breast cancers had significantly poorer responses to trastuzumab-based therapy than those with normal PTEN. Thus, PTEN deficiency is a powerful predictor for trastuzumab resistance.

Endemic scrub typhus was originally thought to be confined to the so called ""tsutsugamushi triangle"" within the Asia-Pacific region. In 2006, however, two individual cases were detected in the Middle East and South America, which suggested that the pathogen was present farther afield. Here, we report three autochthonous cases of scrub typhus caused by O. tsutsugamushi acquired on Chiloé Island in southern Chile, which suggests the existence of an endemic focus in South America.

As of now, there is not a board certification process in neuropsychology, although there is one in clinical psychology.|Neuropsychology and other mental health disciplines in Mexico and Latin America have historically been poorly funded, and have lacked optimal means of communication as to research findings and clinical initiatives and standards. However, there is reason to think that this will be improved upon in coming years.",nonCancer
1187,Mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor and in KRAS are predictive and prognostic indicators in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy alone and in combination with erlotinib.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations have been associated with tumor response to treatment with single-agent EGFR inhibitors in patients with relapsed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The implications of EGFR mutations in patients treated with EGFR inhibitors plus first-line chemotherapy are unknown. KRAS is frequently activated in NSCLC. The relationship of KRAS mutations to outcome after EGFR inhibitor treatment has not been described. Previously untreated patients with advanced NSCLC in the phase III TRIBUTE study who were randomly assigned to carboplatin and paclitaxel with erlotinib or placebo were assessed for survival, response, and time to progression (TTP). EGFR exons 18 through 21 and KRAS exon 2 were sequenced in tumors from 274 patients. Outcomes were correlated with EGFR and KRAS mutations in retrospective subset analyses. EGFR mutations were detected in 13% of tumors and were associated with longer survival, irrespective of treatment (P < .001). Among erlotinib-treated patients, EGFR mutations were associated with improved response rate (P < .05) and there was a trend toward an erlotinib benefit on TTP (P = .092), but not improved survival (P = .96). KRAS mutations (21% of tumors) were associated with significantly decreased TTP and survival in erlotinib plus chemotherapy-treated patients. EGFR mutations may be a positive prognostic factor for survival in advanced NSCLC patients treated with chemotherapy with or without erlotinib, and may predict greater likelihood of response. Patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC showed poorer clinical outcomes when treated with erlotinib and chemotherapy. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this retrospective subset analysis.",cancer
1971,Risk excess of mortality and use of antipsychotics: a case-noncase study.,"Severe mental disorders are associated with an increased mortality risk and the use of antipsychotic drugs may be one of the causes. In this study, we addressed the potential association of the reported mortality among patients on antipsychotics compared to other drugs from a pharmacovigilance database with the aim of evaluating the drug-induced mortality risk. A database containing 189 441 entries of suspected adverse reactions reported from 1 January 1995 to 31 December 2012 was explored for fatal outcomes. Potential disproportionality was estimated using the reporting odds ratio, proportional reporting ratio, and the χ-test. Two-hundred fatal outcomes were reported in patients on antipsychotics, which indicated the occurrence of disproportionality for this pharmacological class compared with any other drugs. When data were analysed by antipsychotic subclass, disproportionality was found only for atypical but not for typical antipsychotics. When individually analysed by active substances and routes, only a few substances were found to show disproportionality. The disproportionality encountered in this study compared with the mortality associated with other drugs suggests that the active substances under study may be associated with a mortality risk higher than what is assumed currently. Also, it suggests that atypical antipsychotics are likely to have a mortality risk higher than the risk of typical antipsychotics. The disproportionality found for zuclopentixol, in both oral and depot formulations, can be considered to be a drug surveillance signal.",nonCancer
1820,Evaluation of the Expanded Disability Status Scale and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite as clinical endpoints in multiple sclerosis clinical trials: quantitative meta-analyses.,"This study compared the sensitivity of the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) and the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite (MSFC) as clinical endpoints in multiple sclerosis (MS) clinical trials.|Medline (1946 through 12 September 2014) and Embase (1974 through 12 September 2014) databases searches were conducted using keywords and Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms related to MS, EDSS, and MSFC. Only studies that used the EDSS and MSFC as endpoints were assessed. All statistical analyses were conducted using comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA). The percentages of the overall changes in EDSS and MSFC were compared. The relative risks were calculated in randomized clinical trials (RCTs).|A total of 123 studies were identified. There were nine studies (6 case series and 3 RCTs) included in the analysis. In the case series, the EDSS change rate in MS patients was 33.5% (95% CI: 12.9-63.2%) and the MSFC change rate was 30.3% (95% CI: 9.2-65.2%). In RCTs, patients who take the drug would be 22.9 times as likely as patients who did not take the drug to experience a change in the EDSS scale (RR = 22.9, 95% CI = 0.996-1.517, p = 0.055). Patients who take the drug would be 48.9 times as likely as patients who did not take the drug to experience a change in the MSFC scale (RR = 48.9, 95% CI = CI = 0.916-2.419, p = 0.108).|This study focused only on MS patient improvement (positive changes) on the EDSS and MSFC. More studies are needed to include patient deterioration (negative changes) on EDSS and MSFC.|There is controversy about the sensitivity of the EDSS and MSFC in detecting the progression of MS disease. The EDSS and MSFC are effective tools to assess the clinical severity and progression of MS disease. MSFC is more sensitive than EDSS in detecting the progression of MS disease.",nonCancer
2275,In Vivo Differentiation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells into Insulin Producing Cells on Electrospun Poly-L-Lactide Acid Scaffolds Coated with Matricaria chamomilla L. Oil.,"This study examined the in vivo differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into insulin producing cells (IPCs) on electrospun poly-L-lactide acid (PLLA) scaffolds coated with Matricaria chammomila L. (chamomile) oil.|In this interventional, experimental study adipose MSCs (AMSCs) were isolated from 12 adult male New Zealand white rabbits and characterized by flow cytometry. AMSCs were subsequently differentiated into osteogenic and adipogenic lines. Cells were seeded onto either a PLLA scaffold (control) or PLLA scaffold coated with chamomile oil (experimental). A total of 24 scaffolds were inserted into the pancreatic area of each rabbit and placement was confirmed by ultrasound. After 21 days, immunohistochemistry analysis of insulin-producing like cells on protein levels confirmed insulin expression of insulin producing cells (IPSCs). Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) determined the expressions of genes related to pancreatic endocrine development and function.|Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) results confirmed the existence of oil on the surface of the PLLA scaffold. The results showed a new peak at 2854 cm(-1) for the aliphatic CH2 bond. Pdx1 expression was 0.051 ± 0.007 in the experimental group and 0.009 ± 0.002 in the control group. There was significantly increased insulin expression in the scaffold coated with chamomile oil (0.09 ± 0.001) compared to control group (0.063 ± 0.009, P≤0.05). Both groups expressed Ngn3 and Pdx1 specific markers and pancreatic tissue was observed at 21 days post transplantation.|The pancreatic region is an optimal site for differentiation of AMSCs to IPCs. Chamomile oil (as an antioxidant agent) can affect cell adhesion to the scaffold and increase cell differentiation. In addition, the oil may lead to increased blood glucose uptake in pathways in the muscles, liver and fatty tissue of a diabetic animal model by some probable molecular mechanisms.",nonCancer
184,TET2 mutation is an independent favorable prognostic factor in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDSs).,"Oncogenic pathways underlying in the development of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) remain poorly characterized, but mutations of the ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2) gene are frequently observed. In the present work, we evaluated the prognostic impact of TET2 mutations in MDS. Frameshift, nonsense, missense mutations, or defects in gene structure were identified in 22 (22.9%) of 96 patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 14.5-31.3 patients). Mutated and unmutated patients did not significantly differ in initial clinical or hematologic parameters. The 5-year OS was 76.9% (95% CI, 49.2%-91.3%) in mutated versus 18.3% (95% CI, 4.2%-41.1%) in unmutated patients (P = .005). The 3-year leukemia-free survival was 89.3% (95% CI, 63.1%-97.0%) in mutated versus 63.7% (95% CI, 48.2%-75.4%) in unmutated patients (P = .035). In univariate analysis (Cox proportional hazard model), the absence of TET2 mutation was associated with a 4.1-fold (95% CI, 1.4-12.0-fold) increased risk of death (P = .009). In multivariate analysis adjusted for age, International Prognostic Scoring System, and transfusion requirement, the presence of TET2 mutation remained an independent factor of favorable prognosis (hazard ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 1.6-16.3; P = .005). These results indicate that TET2 mutations observed in approximately 20% of patients, irrespective of the World Health Organization or French-American-British subtype, represent a molecular marker for good prognosis in MDS.",cancer
659,HER2 activating mutations are targets for colorectal cancer treatment.,"The Cancer Genome Atlas project identified HER2 somatic mutations and gene amplification in 7% of patients with colorectal cancer. Introduction of the HER2 mutations S310F, L755S, V777L, V842I, and L866M into colon epithelial cells increased signaling pathways and anchorage-independent cell growth, indicating that they are activating mutations. Introduction of these HER2 activating mutations into colorectal cancer cell lines produced resistance to cetuximab and panitumumab by sustaining MAPK phosphorylation. HER2 mutants are potently inhibited by low nanomolar doses of the irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors neratinib and afatinib. HER2 gene sequencing of 48 cetuximab-resistant, quadruple (KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA) wild-type (WT) colorectal cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDX) identified 4 PDXs with HER2 mutations. HER2-targeted therapies were tested on two PDXs. Treatment with a single HER2-targeted drug (trastuzumab, neratinib, or lapatinib) delayed tumor growth, but dual HER2-targeted therapy with trastuzumab plus tyrosine kinase inhibitors produced regression of these HER2-mutated PDXs. HER2 activating mutations cause EGFR antibody resistance in colorectal cell lines, and PDXs with HER2 mutations show durable tumor regression when treated with dual HER2-targeted therapy. These data provide a strong preclinical rationale for clinical trials targeting HER2 activating mutations in metastatic colorectal cancer.",cancer
1028,Identification of intragenic mutations in the von Hippel-Lindau disease tumour suppressor gene and correlation with disease phenotype.,"Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a dominantly inherited familial cancer syndrome predisposing to a variety of malignant and benign neoplasms, most frequently retinal, cerebellar and spinal haemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, phaeochromocytoma and pancreatic tumours. We have previously detected large germline deletions by Southern analysis and pulsed field gel electrophoresis in 19% and 3% of VHL patients respectively. We have now investigated 94 VHL patients without large deletions for intragenic mutations using single strand conformation polymorphism and heteroduplex analysis. Forty different mutations were identified in 55 unrelated kindreds. A wide variety of mutations were detected including missense (n = 19), nonsense (n = 6), frameshift deletions or insertions (n = 12), in frame deletions (n = 2) and a splice donor site mutation (n = 1). The two most frequent mutations, were missense mutations at codon 238 (Arg-->Gln and Arg-->Trp) and were detected in five and four unrelated kindreds, respectively. VHL disease shows marked phenotypic variability and although phaeochromocytoma occurs in only about 7% of patients, marked interfamilial differences are observed. We examined the relationship between VHL gene mutations and phenotype in 65 kindreds. Large deletions or intragenic mutations predicted to cause a truncated protein were found in 36 of 53 families without phaeochromocytoma but only two of 12 families with phaeochromocytoma (chi 2 = 8.58; P < 0.01). Of 12 families with phaeochromocytoma 10 had missense mutations compared with 13 of 53 kindreds without phaeochromocytoma (chi 2 = 12.33; P < 0.001). In particular, substitution of an arginine at codon 238 (Arg-->Trp or Arg-->Gln) was associated with a high risk (62%) of phaeochromocytoma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",cancer

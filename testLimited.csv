751,"Second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer.","Crizotinib as the first-generation ALK inhibitor has shown significant activity in ALK-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Second- and third-generation ALK inhibitors are entering clinical applications for ALK+ NSCLC. In addition, a third-generation ALK inhibitor, lorlatinib (PF-06463922), was reported to resensitize NSCLC to crizotinib. This review provided a summary of clinical development of alectinib, ceritinib, brigatinib (AP26113), and lorlatinib."
299,"Common variations in ERCC2 are associated with response to cisplatin chemotherapy and clinical outcome in osteosarcoma patients.","Platinum agents cause DNA cross-linking. Nucleotide excision repair genes play a key role in DNA damage repair. This study aims to investigate whether polymorphisms in these genes are associated with tumor response and survival in cisplatin-treated osteosarcoma patients. Eight single nucleotide polymorphisms in ERCC2, XPC, XPA, ERCC1, ERCC4 and ERCC5 genes were analyzed in 91 patients diagnosed with osteosarcoma and treated with cisplatin. A significant association with tumor response, after correction for multiple testing, was found for the Lys751Gln polymorphism in the ERCC2 gene. We found that only 45% of patients with at least one polymorphic G allele responded compared with 80% of patients homozygous for the common T allele (odds ratio=4.9, 95% confidence interval=1.64-14.54, adjusted P-value=0.047). In addition, carrying at least one ERCC2 Lys751GlnG allele was significantly associated with shorter event-free survival (median=184 months, compared with 240 months for TT homozygotes; hazard ratio=5.76, 95% confidence interval=1.30-25.55; P-value=0.021). Although ototoxicity was only recorded in 32 patients, we found weak evidence of an association with the CC genotype of XPC Lys939Gln (P-value= 0.042). This is the first pharmacogenetic study focused on osteosarcoma treatment providing evidence that polymorphic variants in DNA repair genes could be useful predictors of response to cisplatin chemotherapy in osteosarcoma patients."
3,"Mutant DNMT3A: a marker of poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia.","The prevalence, the prognostic effect, and interaction with other molecular markers of DNMT3A mutations was studied in 415 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) younger than 60 years. We show mutations in DNMT3A in 96 of 415 patients with newly diagnosed AML (23.1%). Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that patients with DNMT3A(mutant) AML show significantly worse overall survival (OS; P = .022; hazard ratio [HR], 1.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-1.81), and relapse-free survival (RFS; P = .005; HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.13-2.05) than DNMT3A(wild-type) AMLs. In a multivariable analysis, DNMT3A mutations express independent unfavorable prognostic value for OS (P = .003; HR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.2-2.7) and RFS (P < .001; HR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4-3.3). In a composite genotypic subset of cytogenetic intermediate-risk AML without FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations, this association is particularly evident (OS: P = .013; HR, 2.09; 95% CI, 1.16-3.77; RFS: P = .001; HR, 2.65; 95% CI, 1.48-4.89). The effect of DNMT3A mutations in human AML remains elusive, because DNMT3A(mutant) AMLs did not express a methylation or gene expression signature that discriminates them from patients with DNMT3A(wild-type) AML. We conclude that DNMT3A mutation status is an important factor to consider for risk stratification of patients with AML."
2091,"Identification of dual ligands targeting angiotensin II type 1 receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ by core hopping of telmisartan.","It has been reported previously that some angiotensin II receptor blockers not only antagonize angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), but also exert stimulation in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) partial activation, among which telmisartan displays the best. Telmisartan has been tested as a bifunctional ligand with antihypertensive and hypoglycemic activity. Aiming at more potent leads with selective AT1R antagonism and PPARγ partial agonism, the three parts of telmisartan including the distal benzimidazole ring, the biphenyl moiety, and the carboxylic acid group experienced modification by core hopping method in our study. The central benzimidazole ring, however, remained intact considering its great affinity toward AT1R and PPARγ. We utilized computational techniques for the sake of details on the binding interactions and conformational stability. Standard precision docking analysis and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity prediction received 10 molecules with higher Glide scores, similar interactions, and improved pharmacokinetic profiles compared to telmisartan. Comp#91 with highest scores for AT1R (-11.92 kcal/mol) and PPARγ (-13.88 kcal/mol) exhibited excellent binding modes and pharmacokinetic parameters. Molecular dynamics trajectories on best docking pose of comp#91 confirmed the docking results and verified the conformational stability with both receptors throughout the course of 20-ns simulations. Thus, comp#91 could be identified as a promising lead in the development of dual AT1R antagonist and PPARγ partial agonist against hypertension and type 2 diabetes."
1908,"Rheological Properties of Calcium Hydroxylapatite With Integral Lidocaine.","Calcium hydroxylapatite with integral lidocaine, CaHA (+), received FDA approval in 2015 and CE mark approval in 2016. This formulation has been associated with significant pain reduction compared to CaHA. In a previous rheometry study, CaHA without lidocaine demonstrated higher viscosity and elasticity when compared with hyaluronic acid fillers.|To compare the rheological properties of CaHA (+) lidocaine to CaHA without lidocaine and to compare the rheological measures of CaHA (+) to 5 cross-linked hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers with integral 0.3% lidocaine.<br/> MATERIALS AND METHODS: The rheological properties of complex viscosity (&eta;*) and elastic modulus (G') were measured for 2 types of CaHA fillers [CaHA without lidocaine and CaHA (+) with integral 0.3% lidocaine] and 5 HA fillers using an oscillation frequency sweep at a sheer stress of 5 pascal tau (Pa) and an interpolation of 0.7 Hz.<br/> RESULTS: CaHA with and without integral lidocaine demonstrate similar &eta;* and G' measurements. CaHA with and without integral lidocaine demonstrates higher &eta;* and G' compared with HA fillers with integral lidocaine.<br/> CONCLUSION: CaHA with integral lidocaine has a similar rheological profile to CaHA without lidocaine: the highest &eta;* and G' compared with available HA fillers with integral lidocaine. <br /><br /> <em>J Drugs Dermatol.</em> 2016;15(9):1107-1110."
432,"Activation of AR sensitizes breast carcinomas to NVP-BEZ235's therapeutic effect mediated by PTEN and KLLN upregulation.","NVP-BEZ235 is a newly developed dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor, being tested in multiple clinical trials, including breast cancer. NVP-BEZ235 selectively induces cell growth inhibition in a subset, but not all, breast cancer cell lines. However, it remains a challenge to distinguish between sensitive and resistant tumors, particularly in the pretreatment setting. Here, we used ten breast cancer cell lines to compare NVP-BEZ235 sensitivity and in the context of androgen receptor (AR) activation during NVP-BEZ235 treatment. We also used female SCID mice bearing breast tumor xenografts to investigate the beneficial effect of dihydrotestosterone/NVP-BEZ235 combination treatment compared with each alone. We found that AR-positive breast cancer cell lines are much more sensitive to NVP-BEZ235 compared with AR-negative cells, regardless of PTEN or PI3KCA status. Reintroducing AR expression in NVP-BEZ235 nonresponsive AR-negative cells restored the response. DHT/NVP-BEZ235 combination not only resulted in a more significant growth inhibition than either drug alone, but also achieved tumor regression and complete responses for AR(+)/ER(+) tumors. This beneficial effect was mediated by dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced PTEN and KLLN expression. Furthermore, DHT could also reverse NVP-BEZ235-induced side effects such as skin rash and weight loss. Our data suggest that AR expression may be an independent predictive biomarker for response to NVP-BEZ235. AR induction could add benefit during NVP-BEZ235 treatment in patients, especially with AR(+)/ER(+) breast carcinomas."
2479,"ATF3 suppresses ESCC via downregulation of ID1.","Esophageal cancer is one of the most prevalent forms of cancer and has a particularly high mortality rate due to early metastasis; however, the underlying mechanisms of its formation and progression remain unclear. The present study performed immunohistochemical analysis and observed that the expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) was reduced in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in comparison with non-tumor adjacent tissues. By contrast, inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) was overexpressed in ESCC tissues, demonstrating an inverse correlation with ATF3 (P<0.01). In ESCC EC109 and KYSE450 cells lines, transfection with an ATF3-overexpression plasmid resulted in the inhibition of cell proliferation, motility and migration, which was associated with the induction of E-cadherin expression and inhibition of cyclin D1 and Twist. Notably, ATF3 exerted an inverse regulatory interaction with ID1. The results of the present study provide additional evidence of the tumor suppressive features of ATF3 and demonstrate a novel mechanism of ATF3-mediated inhibition of cancer metastasis in esophageal cancer."
1010,"CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen response for breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.","To evaluate evidence on the association between CYP2D6 genotype and tamoxifen response through. Systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective, cross-sectional and case-control studies published to 2012. For each study, relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were extracted and pooled with a fixed and random effects model. Heterogeneity, publication bias, subgroup, and meta-regression analyses were performed. PubMed (inception-2012) and EMBASE (inception-2012). Criteria for inclusion were studies reporting breast cancer outcomes in patients treated with tamoxifen and genotyped for polymorphisms in the CYP2D6 gene. Twenty-five studies of 13,629 individuals were identified, of which 22 investigated the association of CYP2D6 genotype with outcomes in breast cancer women all receiving tamoxifen treatment (""treatment-only"" design). Three randomized trials evaluated the effect of CYP2D6 genotype on tamoxifen response (""effect modification"" design). In analysis of treatment-only studies, the relative risk (RR) of all-cause mortality (>307 events in 4,936 patients) for carriers of a CYP2D6 reduced function allele was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.94 to 1.31) compared to individuals with normal/increased function CYP2D6 alleles. When we investigated a composite outcome including all-cause mortality and surrogate endpoints for overall survival (>307 events in 6,721 patients), carriers of a CYP2D6 reduced function allele had a RR of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.11 to 1.45). From two randomized trials that permitted effect-modification analysis, one had only 154 patients and showed evidence of effect modification of tamoxifen by CYP2D6 genotype for distant recurrence but was directionally opposite to that predicted, whereas a larger trial of 2,537 patients failed to show evidence of effect modification for breast cancer-free interval (P values for interaction 0.02 and 0.44, respectively). Based on these findings, there is insufficient evidence to recommend CYP2D6 genotyping to guide tamoxifen treatment."
1935,"Diversity-oriented synthesis yields novel multistage antimalarial inhibitors.","Antimalarial drugs have thus far been derived mainly from two sources - natural products and synthetic 'drug-like' compounds. We hypothesized that antimalarial agents with novel mechanisms of action might be discovered using a diverse collection of synthetic compounds having three-dimensional features reminiscent of natural products and underrepresented in typical screening collections. We identified such compounds with both previously reported and undescribed mechanisms of action, including a series of bicyclic azetidines that inhibit a new antimalarial target, phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase. The bicylic azetidines display single low-dose cure with activity against all parasite life stages in multiple in vivo efficacy models. Our findings identify bicyclic azetidines with the potential to cure and prevent transmission of the disease as well as protect populations at risk, all in a single oral exposure, and highlight the strength of diversity-oriented synthesis to reveal promising therapeutic targets."
1132,"IDH1 or IDH2 mutations predict longer survival and response to temozolomide in low-grade gliomas.","Recent studies have shown that IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur frequently in gliomas, including low-grade gliomas. However, their impact on the prognosis and chemosensitivity of low-grade gliomas remains unclear. Search for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations, loss of heterozygosity on chromosomes 1p and 19q, MGMT promoter methylation, and p53 expression was performed in a series of 271 low-grade gliomas and correlated with overall survival. A subgroup of 84 patients treated up-front with temozolomide was individualized. Response to temozolomide was evaluated by progression-free survival, as well as by tumor size on successive MRI scans, and then correlated with molecular alterations. IDH (IDH1 or IDH2) mutations were found in 132/189 patients (70%). IDH mutation and 1p-19q codeletion were associated with prolonged overall survival in univariate (p = 0.002 and p = 0.0001) and multivariate analysis (p = 0.003 and p = 0.004). 1p-19q codeletion, MGMT promoter methylation, and IDH mutation (p = 0.01) were correlated with a higher rate of response to temozolomide. Further analysis of the course of the disease prior to any treatment except for surgery (untreated subgroup) showed that 1p-19q codeletion was associated with prolonged progression-free survival in univariate analysis, whereas IDH mutation was not. IDH mutation appears to be a significant marker of positive prognosis and chemosensitivity in low-grade gliomas, independently of 1p-19q codeletion, whereas its impact on the course of untreated tumors seems to be limited."
1337,"Process Optimization on Micro-Aeration Supply for High Production Yield of 2,3-Butanediol from Maltodextrin by Metabolically-Engineered Klebsiella oxytoca.","An optimization process with a cheap and abundant substrate is considered one of the factors affecting the price of the production of economical 2,3-Butanediol (2,3-BD). A combination of the conventional method and response surface methodology (RSM) was applied in this study. The optimized levels of pH, aeration rate, agitation speed, and substrate concentration (maltodextrin) were investigated to determine the cost-effectiveness of fermentative 2,3-BD production by metabolically-engineered Klebsiella oxytoca KMS005. Results revealed that pH, aeration rate, agitation speed, and maltodextrin concentration at levels of 6.0, 0.8 vvm, 400 rpm, and 150 g/L respectively were the optimal conditions. RSM also indicated that the agitation speed was the most influential parameter when either agitation and aeration interaction or agitation and substrate concentration interaction played important roles for 2,3-BD production by the strain from maltodextrin. Under interim fed-batch fermentation, 2,3-BD concentration, yield, and productivity were obtained at 88.1±0.2 g/L, 0.412±0.001 g/g, and 1.13±0.01 g/L/h respectively within 78 h."
1642,"First case report of an adrenocortical carcinoma caused by a BRCA2 mutation.","Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) may rarely be a component of inherited cancer syndromes such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. ACC caused by a BRCA2 mutation has never been reported.|Nucleotide sequencing of BRCA2 in lymphocyte and tumoral DNA of a 50-year-old male who presented with an androgen-secreting ACC and a strong family history of breast, ovarian, and pancreatic cancers.|A germline BRCA2 2 bp heterozygous deletion at nucleotide 8765 (8765delAG) leading to a frameshift mutation (p.Glu2846GlyfsX23) was detected. Only the BRCA2 deleted allele was retained in the ACC tumoral DNA compared with the control DNA supporting a loss of heterozygosity in the tumor.|This is the first reported case of a patient with ACC associated with a BRCA2 germline mutation. Loss of heterozygosity in ACC DNA suggests a causal link with the BRCA2 8765delAG mutation."
1867,"Screen of Non-annotated Small Secreted Proteins of Pseudomonas syringae Reveals a Virulence Factor That Inhibits Tomato Immune Proteases.","Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (PtoDC3000) is an extracellular model plant pathogen, yet its potential to produce secreted effectors that manipulate the apoplast has been under investigated. Here we identified 131 candidate small, secreted, non-annotated proteins from the PtoDC3000 genome, most of which are common to Pseudomonas species and potentially expressed during apoplastic colonization. We produced 43 of these proteins through a custom-made gateway-compatible expression system for extracellular bacterial proteins, and screened them for their ability to inhibit the secreted immune protease C14 of tomato using competitive activity-based protein profiling. This screen revealed C14-inhibiting protein-1 (Cip1), which contains motifs of the chagasin-like protease inhibitors. Cip1 mutants are less virulent on tomato, demonstrating the importance of this effector in apoplastic immunity. Cip1 also inhibits immune protease Pip1, which is known to suppress PtoDC3000 infection, but has a lower affinity for its close homolog Rcr3, explaining why this protein is not recognized in tomato plants carrying the Cf-2 resistance gene, which uses Rcr3 as a co-receptor to detect pathogen-derived protease inhibitors. Thus, this approach uncovered a protease inhibitor of P. syringae, indicating that also P. syringae secretes effectors that selectively target apoplastic host proteases of tomato, similar to tomato pathogenic fungi, oomycetes and nematodes."
1422,"Copper trafficking to the secretory pathway.","Copper (Cu) is indispensible for growth and development of human organisms. It is required for such fundamental and ubiquitous processes as respiration and protection against reactive oxygen species. Cu also enables catalytic activity of enzymes that critically contribute to the functional identity of many cells and tissues. Pigmentation, production of norepinephrine by the adrenal gland, the key steps in the formation of connective tissue, neuroendocrine signaling, wound healing - all these processes require Cu and depend on Cu entering the secretory pathway. To reach the Cu-dependent enzymes in a lumen of the trans-Golgi network and various vesicular compartments, Cu undertakes a complex journey crossing the extracellular and intracellular membranes and staying firmly on course while traveling in a cytosol. The proteins that assist Cu in this journey by mediating its entry, distribution, and export, have been identified. The accumulating data also indicate that the current model of cellular Cu homeostasis is still a ""skeleton"" that has to be fleshed out with many new details. This review summarizes recent data on the mechanisms responsible for Cu transfer to the secretory pathway. The emerging new concepts and gaps in our knowledge are discussed."
2401,"Near complete genome sequence of the animal feed probiotic, Bacillus amyloliquefaciens H57.","Bacillus amyloliquefaciens H57 is a bacterium isolated from lucerne for its ability to prevent feed spoilage. Further interest developed when ruminants fed with H57-inoculated hay showed increased weight gain and nitrogen retention relative to controls, suggesting a probiotic effect. The near complete genome of H57 is ~3.96 Mb comprising 16 contigs. Within the genome there are 3,836 protein coding genes, an estimated sixteen rRNA genes and 69 tRNA genes. H57 has the potential to synthesise four different lipopeptides and four polyketide compounds, which are known antimicrobials. This antimicrobial capacity may facilitate the observed probiotic effect."
2057,"Absolute Ligand Discrimination by Dimeric Signaling Receptors.","Many signaling pathways act through shared components, where different ligand molecules bind the same receptors or activate overlapping sets of response regulators downstream. Nevertheless, different ligands acting through cross-wired pathways often lead to different outcomes in terms of the target cell behavior and function. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed, it still largely remains unclear how cells can reliably discriminate different molecular ligands under such circumstances. Here we show that signaling via ligand-induced receptor dimerization-a very common motif in cellular signaling-naturally incorporates a mechanism for the discrimination of ligands acting through the same receptor."
2249,"Asthma in Rhinosinusitis: A Survey from Iran.","The coexistence of asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is more common than expected given their individual prevalence in the general population and may affect patient's quality of life. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of asthma in chronic rhinosinusitis in Mashhad, Northeast Iran.|This study was performed in two university hospital from November 2012 for 12 months. In total, 153 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis were enrolled and referred to a particular pulmonologist for asthma evaluation.|The mean age of participants was 40.54±13.11 years, and 41.8% were male. In total, 63.4% of patients had the polypoid form of CRS. The proportion of patients in this study with asthma was 41.8%, compared with a general asthma prevalence in this region of 13.5%.|There is a high prevalence of asthma among patients with CRS, but it often remains undiagnosed. Asthma in CRS patients should be diagnosed and treated in order to improve patient's quality of life. We recommend an evaluation of the lower airways in all of these patients as well as further studies in this field."
2390,"Primary Gastric Chorioadenocarcinoma.","Primary gastric chorioadenocarcinoma (PGC) is a rare and rapidly invasive tumor. Choriocarcinoma is usually known to be of endometrial origin and gestational; however, it has been reported in other extragenital organs, such as the gall bladder, prostate, lung, liver, and the gastrointestinal tract. Human chorionic gonadotropin related neoplasms of the stomach are seldom discussed in the literature. We report a case of PGC in a 56-year-old man treated with a standard non-gestational choriocarcinoma chemotherapy regimen, EMA/CO (etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, vincristine), with a complete response and good tolerability."
1801,"Pattern of Uveitis in a Tertiary Ophthalmology Center in Thailand.","To study the etiology and pattern of uveitis in a tertiary ophthalmology center in Thailand.|A cross-sectional study was conducted on uveitis patients presenting to a uveitis clinic at Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand, between February 2014 and January 2015.|A total of 758 uveitis patients were enrolled into this study. The most common identified cause was herpetic uveitis (17.2%), followed by Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease (13.5%), cytomegalovirus uveitis (12.7%), and HLA-B27/spondyloarthropathy-associated uveitis (12.4%).|Herpetic uveitis was the commonest form of infectious uveitis, whereas Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease was most frequently seen as the non-infectious cause of uveitis in Thailand."
1639,"Femoral nerve block for patient undergoing total knee arthroplasty: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study evaluating analgesic effect of perineural fentanyl additive to local anesthetics.","The existence of peripheral opioid receptors and its effectiveness in peripheral nerve block remain controversial. The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was to examine the analgesic effects of adding fentanyl to ropivacaine for continuous femoral nerve block (CFNB) using patient-controlled analgesia after total knee arthroplasty (TKA).|The patients were divided into 2 groups, each with n = 40 in ropivacaine (R) group and n = 42 in R with fentanyl (R + F) group. After operation, the patients in each group received R + F and R alone via a femoral nerve catheter, respectively. We assessed the visual analog scale (VAS) pain immediately before administration (baseline) and at 15, 30, and 60 minutes on postanesthesia care unit (PACU), and resting and ambulatory VAS score up to 24 hours.|Overall, the average VAS scores in the R + F group were slightly lower than those of the R group. However, the VAS score differences between groups were not statistically significant, except for 30 minutes (P = 0.009) in PACU. R group showed higher supplemental analgesics consumption in average compared with R + F group, but not significant.|Additional fentanyl did not show prominent enhancement of analgesic effect in the field of CFNB after TKA."
